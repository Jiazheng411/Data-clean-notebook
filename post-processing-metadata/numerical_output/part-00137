The chairman exerts extraordinary influence over the strategic direction of the company, yet at the same time must manage the delicate relationships and critical business of the board of directors. Remarkably, precious little research has been conducted into the nature of chairmanship, and most chairmen are forced to learn on the job, with no training or formal preparation. Writing primarily for new chairmen, chairmen of small to midsize businesses, and chairmen in the nonprofit sector, while also offering practical guidance to seasoned leaders of major corporations, Brian Lechem provides a fascinating look at the essential duties of this pivotal role in Chairman of the Board: A Practical Guide.As companies become more and more international and accountability requirements increasingly stringent, the chairman of the board must confront a constantly evolving array of risks and responsibilities. Lechem identifies a chairman's four primary functions:* Concentrate on strategic leadership, focusing on an appropriate and realistic vision* Ensure that the board is constituted with a good blend of skills, experience, and business competence* Guarantee that the corporation has the policies, procedures, and resources in place to achieve its goals* Monitor the achievement of these goals and ensure that the board is provided with the appropriate information it needs to be effectiveLechem offers practical advice on matters such as how to work with the CEO, ethical considerations, corporate social responsibility, and performance evaluation of boards and board members. He discusses key regulatory issues and legal exposures the board must address in an increasingly litigious society and addresses the thorny problem of board disagreement and dissent-the moment \"management\" is tossed aside and a chairman's \"leadership\" must take center stage.Chairing a board of directors undoubtedly requires a host of intangible skills, but applying Brian Lechem's proven, practical guidelines will nevertheless give a chairman the best chance for success. Chairman of the Board is a must-read for any professional who aspires to the peak of his or her profession.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is little, in fact, to report on the negative front; Allen had ample access to family and friends to paint a flattering portrait.

Oops. Serena tried not to grimace. Had she sounded too enthusiastic for a woman with a devoted boyfriend?\"That is, if no one else wants to go,\" she added with a forced smile.\"Well, darlin',\" Belle Mackenzie, owner of The Wedding Belles, purred in her distinct Southern drawl. A beautiful woman with coiffed silver hair and a generous glossed smile, she gave the best hugs this side of the Mason-Dixon line. \"That's sweet of you to offer. We do need a little positive publicity after the Vandiver wedding cancellation fiasco, and the show's sponsors would be delighted to have one of the country's up-and-coming wedding dress designers fill in at the last moment.\"This was going to work. Satisfaction filled Serena.\"But you usually avoid bridal shows,\" Belle continued. \"Are you sure about this with all you have going on?\"\"I'm sure,\" Serena answered, hoping to sound willing but not desperate. \"Besides, there really isn't anyone else.\"Belle drummed her French-manicured nails on the mahogany table. \"That's true. We all seem to have an extra serving or two on our plates.\"\"Well, whoever goes to Seattle—\" Callie Underwood, florist extraordinaire, brushed a lock of dark blond hair off her face \"—I want them to take my wedding gown to the show.\"The other women gasped.\"You're getting married in just a few weeks,\" Belle said.\"November 22 to be exact, as Jared keeps reminding me, but we need to show brides that The Wedding Belles is still one of the premier wedding planning companies in the country, if not the world,\" Callie explained. \"That means showing off what we do best, everything from Natalie's delicious cakes to Serena's stunning designs. Serena's entire spring line is beautiful, but my custom gown is her latest and most exquisite creation.\"\"But it's your wedding dress,\" Serena said. \"I made it to fit you, not some size zero model. Anyway, I wouldn't want to risk getting makeup or runway stains on the silk.\"\"That doesn't mean you couldn't display the gown on a mannequin in the booth.\"\"What if something happens to the dress?\" Regina O'Ryan, a gifted photographer, asked.\"Nothing will happen to it.\" Callie winked across the table. \"Isn't that right, Serena?\"\"Not if I'm the one who goes to Seattle.\" Serena appreciated her friend's vote of confidence. She wouldn't let Callie down. \"I'll make sure the dress comes back.\"\"Seattle is on the other side of the country.\" Regina, her brown eyes as bright as the flash on her ever-present camera, leaned toward her. \"Did you and Rupert have plans for that weekend?\"Serena gritted her teeth at the mention of her boyfriend's—make that ex-boyfriend's—name, but her smile remained steadfast. \"He's been traveling a lot himself. He won't mind.\"At all.She hadn't spoken to him in months. Not since he'd dumped her in April after The Wedding Belles' assistant, Julie Montgomery, had announced her engagement to Matt McLachlan. Serena still hadn't figured out how to tell people.Things like this didn't happen to her. Serena lived a charmed life. She was used to getting what she wanted. She'd wanted to get married and start a family. She'd thought she'd found the right guy except that she'd been too focused on the end result to realize he hadn't been so right after all.\"We don't have any plans,\" she added.\"You got the last good man, Serena,\" Natalie Thompson, a young widow with mischievous eight-year-old twin girls, said. The petite blonde sighed. \"After Julie, Callie and Regina. Pretty soon, we'll have another Belle's wedding to plan. I can already guess the cake you'll want. Chocolate with orange-flavored fudge filling.\"The baker, who called herself a cake fairy, brought in slices for the Belles to try every time she made samples for brides to taste. That Natalie remembered her favorite flavor touched Serena.\"And I know the flowers.\" Callie's green eyes twinkled like the white mini decorator lights she used with yards of tulle and garlands of blossoms. \"White dendrobium orchids, green roses, green cymbidium orchids and white and green parrot tulips.\"White and green. One of Serena's favorite color combinations. She shouldn't be surprised. Callie knew her tastes so well.A cake. Flowers. Serena's friends had her perfect wedding figured out. The only thing missing was…the groom.A weight pressed down on the center of her chest. She thought of the nearly completed wedding dress hanging in her hall closet. Okay, she had been foolish, tempting fate by starting on the gown before she had a ring. But who could blame her?Her relationship with Rupert Collier had proceeded right on schedule. They'd dated a year, met and liked each other's families and talked about the future, about creating a family together, which was what Serena wanted most of all. Becoming engaged had been the next obvious step. She'd started work on her wedding dress because she'd wanted time to get every stitch and every detail exactly right. She'd chosen the fabrics and design with the same care with which she'd chosen Rupert Collier. Not only smart, gorgeous and rich, but also ideal husband and father material. Everything she'd been looking for in a man, everything her friends expected her boyfriend to be, everything her parents wanted her to marry.Until, impatient for a ring after dating exclusively for so long, she'd brought up the M-word. Marriage. And suddenly her perfect boyfriend wasn't ready for a serious relationship. He'd accused her of being too selfish and too self-reliant to make a permanent commitment. Oh he'd wanted to keep seeing her, she remembered bitterly. They looked good together and his boss liked her. But he'd wanted to take a serious step backward in the commitment department. Maybe, he'd suggested, they should start dating other people, too. Serena had said no, thinking he only needed a push to get their relationship back on track. Rupert had said goodbye. Proving once again that if she didn't do what others wanted, she wouldn't get what she wanted.His parting words had stung.You don't need me, Serena. You don't need anyone.In the months since, she'd come to realize he was right. They were better off without each other. She didn't need him. She hadn't loved him the way a woman should love the man she wanted to marry. She hadn't wanted him as much as she liked how he'd fit into her plans. So much for her perfect dress. Her perfect groom. Her perfect life.She forced herself to breathe. A setback, yes. A total failure, no. Serena James didn't fail.Regina grinned, as if she'd found the perfect Kodak moment to capture with her camera. \"Rupert will have to adjust his travel schedule once you get married.\"Serena's stomach roiled. Her temples throbbed. She hated keeping secrets from the women she cared most about in the world, women who were more like family than coworkers, but what else was she supposed to do?Julie had been thrilled about getting engaged. The other Belles were excited to be giving her a dream wedding. Serena couldn't let her bad news affect everyone else's joy. When Callie had fallen in love with Jared, Serena hadn't wanted her breakup to take anything away from the couple's happiness. And after Regina and Dell's marriage had become a love match, Serena couldn't find the right time to tell everyone she'd been dumped.Now wasn't the right time, either.Natalie and Audra Green, the company's accountant, were down on men. Telling them the truth about what had happened would only reaffirm their belief that Mr. Right didn't exist. Serena wouldn't do that to her friends. They'd already faced too much disappointment and heartache.Besides, her friends expected more from her. Everyone did. Serena worked hard on her polished image, kept a positive attitude and was always there in a pinch. People counted on her. They expected her to find Mr. Right.That was exactly what she intended to do—find someone to give her the perfect love, family and life she dreamed about. Just because she'd been wrong about one man didn't mean her one true love wasn't out there somewhere. Maybe even in Seattle.\"So about the bridal show—\" Serena leaned back in her chair \"—what else do I need to bring with me in addition to the wedding dresses?\"Kane Wiley ducked around the business jet's engine to place his bags in the plane's exterior storage compartment. His breath steamed in the November air.\"Is that all you've got?\" his father, Charlie, asked.\"Yep.\" Not only for this flight. All Kane owned— besides the business jet itself—could fit into two bags. He traveled light. And liked it that way.\"I appreciate your making the trip, son.\" Wearing faded jeans, a black turtleneck and down vest, Charlie looked younger than his fifty-six years, even with his salt-and-pepper hair.\"Just hold up your end of the deal, Dad.\"\"I will.\" Charlie picked up a box containing soda, water, ice, boxed lunches and a plate of cookies and brownies. \"I will leave you alone. No more questions. No more badgering you to come home.\"Home. That was a good one. Kane nearly laughed. There hadn't been a real home to come back to since his mom had died suddenly from a heart attack three years ago and his dad had quickly remarried…and divorced.

As the town gears up to celebrate its 130th anniversary, Dorothy helps new resident Katie Durbin come to terms with an unsettling revelation about her family, while Katie's son Josh winningly navigates the turbulent waters of adolescent dating. The novel has some mechanical problems, with sudden and inexplicable shifts in point of view, but the characters are quirky and charming; there are several laugh-out-loud moments; and Baumbich offers gentle inspiration without hammering readers over the head with God, whom Dorothy delightfully calls \"The Big Guy.\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the holiday season approaches, the boys and girls continue to play pranks on one another and begin to learn the consequences of their actions. Caroline Malloy and Wally Hatford are partners for their fourth-grade December project and discover that, instead of annoying one another, they need to learn how to work together in order to receive a passing grade. Told in their alternating viewpoints, the story moves quickly, continuing the mischief and humor of the previous novels. Readers will be especially taken with precocious and dramatic Caroline, who will stop at nothing for revenge. While it is not necessary to read the first three books, fans of the series will enjoy references to the characters' past pranks and will delight in the promise of future additions to this ongoing battle between these rivals.Shawn Brommer, Southern Tier Library System, Corning, NYCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rico, a self-proclaimed gonzo journalist and soft, white... middle-class American with no Spanish, set out to portray the Mexican migrant experience by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, and spends the book searching the borderÖs 2,000-mile length for a safe, convenient place to do so. Such does not exist along a frontier controlled on one side by the U.S. Border Patrol and on the other by drug cartels and gang-affiliated coyotes, and RicoÖs quest eventually reduces him to an almost authentic state of semicriminal desperation. Along the way, he debates and mocks ideologues on all sides, from nutty Minutemen border vigilantes to naïve open-border activists. The book is more about writing a book about the border than it is about the border. Rico himself, with his exaggerated angst, is always the showy central character, and many of his encounters—parading his Minutemen T-shirt before offended Mexican-Americans, soliciting coyotes in a Mexican strip-joint—are transparently staged. Still, when he takes the spotlight off himself, he conveys an arresting panorama of an out-of-control borderland full of seething rancor and foolish dreams.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Biological anthropologist Bribiescas explains the two leading methods of inquiry into that vexing query and accessibly lays out the research findings to date. Those methods are the universally familiar evolutionary theory, explaining the development of species, and the far less well known life-history theory, explaining such life events as growth, reproduction, and senescence in a species. \"Why is there sex?\" is a question answerable primarily in evolutionary terms. \"Why do men's brains differ from women's?\" is most fruitfully investigated by using life-history theory to study fetal development, in particular. Life-history theory comprises three fields of endeavor: demography, or counting organisms; quantitative genetics, which examines interactions among genes and of genes with environmental factors; and trade-off analysis, which assesses how organisms allocate energy and time for physiological needs in a constantly changing environment. Trade-offs figure in a very large proportion of the mounds of research Bribiescas presents in a text that demands to be closely read, with great fascination.Ray OlsonCopyright © American Library Association.

A symbol that labels and explains us? It is our personal flag like the Stars and Stripes or the Tricolore represent the national soul of their countries. I've changed mine over the years. My mother probably had her moments of meaning well, of loving me, and those moments must have their influence as well as any others. My names have taken me from the unwanted mouse to the strident crow to the calm confidence that stretches between the stars.  My writing must be colored by my name. From garish screaming as it's born, through moments of tremulous hesitation, gray shuttering death where words can never flow again, into a golden whispered morning where words and myth are not the crowbar by which my soul breathes, but the gentle invitation of a love yet being born.  I have been a mother, a wife several times, a submissive, a slave, a hopeful, the lost, the angry, the defeated, an American, a Mary Sue, a quiet man with a pink tie, a drag king, a transexual, a peasant, a scholar, a thorn in more than one side, a bandage to bridge one time to another, an experiment, a shadow.... I have been mostly for other people. Jerri Sue. Jari. Nix. Jewls. Nick. Willow. Pinkwhirlwind. Idiot. Crybaby. Nothing. Though these are labels given by others, worn for others.  There is a moment in one of my stories where one of my most favorite characters declares his name, his meaning. That I should take his name, even though I don't have the love that he was born for, that he thrived believing in - is a kind of soul volcanic rebellion. Jewls. Not fractured and severed and servile, clinging to the crumbs of hope and love, but proud and defiant. I am Nix Jewls Winter. This is my flag.  The stories I write are the magma of my life, flowing over and through my soul. I write historicals, science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and just about everything in between. Mostly I write yaoi stories, love between those that should be equals, male/male, though some of my stories are more gender fluid.

The novel opens as Ariane, on the verge of leaving Babbington, summons Leroy to her home to help recount her life there, from her waitressing job at a tacky clam bar to her friendship with Leroy's elderly grandparents to her prominence as a local avant-garde theater star. Leroy's story is a prism of overlapping narrative frames, including a preface in which he celebrates the powers of wishful thinking and recounts how he dreamt Ariane up; a series of synopses of films based on events in Ariane's life; cut-up passages from mythology and other \"found\" texts. Leroy delights in revising his narrative, often reaching an impasse (in one version, Ariane dies in a fire), then backing out and taking a different, sometimes bewildering turn. Indeed, Kraft tends to hit the reader over the head with his self-conscious narrative tricks and his comic touch is dampened by his homespun sentimentality, his gee-whiz, ironic asides and the sophomoric thrill he takes from every swing of Ariane's hips. Steadfast Peter Leroy fans will nevertheless enjoy the playful vitality with which he brings into being the fanciful characters of his imaginative east coast community.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2701413, "title": "What a Piece of Work I Am (The Personal History, Adventures, Experiences & Observations of Peter Leroy) eBook", "author": "Eric Kraft", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders. My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003.

Seeking to negotiate for his release, Mace has documents regarding a hit he carried out on contract the morning 9/11 happened. What follows is a high level cover-up, more deaths, and Claudia, a young lady who, along with her kid brother Adam, find themselves targets of rogue federal agents trying to tie up loose and embarrassing ends. Framed for their parents' murders, they take off on a cross-country race to stay alive long enough to figure out who killed their parents and discover a horrifying truth behind the infamous attacks of 9/11. NO PLACE TO RUN is a tautly written page-turner of a thriller from beginning to end and a highly recommended read. --Midwest Book ReviewNO PLACE TO RUN features Sawyer's famous cinematic prose and, dialogue so authentic it could be bugged by Shadow Ops.

Vince, a timid, middle-aged banker, recently widowed, serves as the story's center and worries that he won't be able to keep up with the group. He has good reason: Clive, the guide, is a fierce environmentalist and veteran of antiglobalization demonstrations whose frustration with peaceful protests coupled with his shock over the death of two fellow demonstrators leads him to consider—with ominous undertones—doing \"something bigger\" for the cause. In Clive's wake is Michela, a young Italian whose clinging, worshipful love of Clive renders her increasingly unstable as the trip progresses. Parks keeps the kayaking scenes lively, and he nails the strange hierarchical culture of group trips—and their possibility for implosion. It's part of what transforms Vince, who begins by ruminating over his wife's cryptic last words (\"I'm so, so sorry\"), but who, over the course of the trip, loses himself in the immediacy of the rushing river, and in Michela, with whom he forges a peculiar bond. It's an urgent, thoughtful and convincing portrayal.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The latest, while no disappointment, isn't likely to propel Hall into the crime fiction big leagues. Seen last treading the boards gingerly in Actor , and before that as a PI chasing cases for liability lawyer Richard Rosenberg, here Hastings is hired on his own. A pretty woman wants him to retrieve some photos with which she is being blackmailed by someone named Barry. Stanley gets the prints, which are high-quality porno shots that don't feature the woman. Before he gets a chance to ask her why she doesn't want the negatives, he finds her dead body. When he finds another, two cops, one smart and one dumb, get on his case. Both victims were actors working a weird sting that makes little sense to anyone; even Hastings's deductions and the smart cop's explanation will challenge the clever reader. Although the characterization here is sharp, the pace brisk and the dialogue snappy, the ornate complexities of the plot detract from the overall impact.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was murdered in his Manhattan home by his brother, Malcolm Webster Ford, at one time the most famous amateur athlete in the United States, who then committed suicide. Ford's edition of The Writings of Thomas Jefferson is still regarded as one of the monuments of American historical scholarship, setting the standard for documentary editing for half-a-century, till the appearance of the first volume of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, edited by Julian A. Boyd. Ford's edition remains valuable for its accuracy of transcription from original manuscripts and its careful annotation of the documents chosen for publication. Ford, however, was at best cool to Jefferson, unlike Boyd, whose critics sometimes attacked him as an uncritical apologist for Jefferson. The Ford edition appeared in two versions, a ten-volume edition published between 1892 and 1896 and a fourteen-volume limited numbered edition (known as the \"Federal\" edition) issued in 1904; other than the different breakdown of volumes, the contents of these editions are identical. Readers, however, have to take note of which edition is being used in a given scholarly work.

The aged pioneer took the trip with all the zest of youth and returned enthusiastic over the adventure. This youthful veteran was Ezra Meeker, of Oregon Trail fame, who throughout his long, courageous, useful life has ever kept in the vanguard of progress. Seventy years ago he became one of the trail-blazers of the Farther West. In 1852, with his young wife and child, he made the hazardous journey over plains and mountains all the way from Iowa to Oregon by ox team. Then, after fifty-four years of struggle in helping to develop the country beyond the Cascades, this undaunted pioneer decided to reblaze the almost lost Oregon Trail. An old \"prairie schooner\" was rebuilt, and a yoke of sturdy oxen was trained to make the trip. With one companion and a faithful dog, the veteran started out. It took nearly two years, but the ox-team journey from Washington, the state, to Washington, our national capital, was finally accomplished. The chief purpose of Mr. Meeker in this enterprise was to induce people to mark the famous old highway. To him it represented a great battle ground in our nation's struggle to win and hold the West. The story of the Oregon Trail, he rightly felt, is an American epic which must be preserved. Through his energy and inspiration and the help of thousands of loyal men and women, school boys and school girls, substantial monuments have now been placed along the greater part of the old pioneer way. The book makes the story of the Oregon Trail live again. This famous old way to the West was traced in the beginning by wild animals the bear, the elk, the buffalo, the soft-footed wolf, and the coyote. Trailing after these animals in quest of food and skins, came the Indians. Then followed the fur-trading mountaineers, the home-seeking pioneers, the gold seekers, the soldiers, and the cowboys. Ezra Meeker has done a signal service for our country in reblazing the Oregon Trail. He has accomplished an even greater work in helping to humanize our history and vitalize the geography of our land, by giving to us, through this little volume, a vivid picture of the heroic pioneering of the Farther West.\"", "related": ["B00C8W23P8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.6364, "rating_total": 51.0}

Soon the beast will awake and rear its terrible head, and we will look back on the days of the subprime disaster with nostalgia. In this riveting book by oil industry expert Kent Moors, you will meet the dragon he refers to as oil vega, and you'll discover why it poses such a grave threat to world economic and political stability.Those familiar with the options and currency markets will recognizevegaas the term traders use to denote the rate of price volatility. Expanding upon that traditional usage, Moors coined the expressionoil vegato describe the dramatic increase of price volatility seen in the oil markets over the past several years. InThe Vega Factor, he describes how, contrary to popular belief, the current environment of runaway volatility in the markets is not the work of diminishing reserves, manipulation by oil producing nations, or increased competition among nations. Rather, it is a result of a structural flaw in the trading system itself.Oil futures contracts, Moors explains, while once a valuable source of liquidity and price stability, have exceeded their historic mandate, leading to an upending of the traditional relationship between \"wet barrels\" and \"paper barrels.\" With oil now as much a financial asset as a commodity, and an oil derivatives market currently worth thousands of times more than the world's combined oil reserves, a perverse dynamic has evolved in which the price of crude chases the price of paper barrels in a race it can never win. In some of the most gripping passages of the book, Moors considers the global mayhem and destruction that will likely result from an ongoing failure by policymakers and industry to peg the value of oil—literally the fuel that drives industrialized economies—to anything more tangible than the greed, fear, and superstition of financial speculators.In the closing chapters ofThe Vega Factor, Moors explores ways in which oil companies, governments, and traders must revise their priorities vis-à-vis oil, as well as the radically new strategic understanding of energy that will be required if we are to meet market realities in an age of oil vega. He also suggests steps consumers and investors can take to protect themselves against the depredations of oil price volatility.We live in a world where the quality of everyone's life and the economic stability of every nation are directly tied to the price of oil.

Why? Because it makes our stories more realistic. If we choose to ignore that advice, we risk our work coming across as unbelievable...or we research. And then we research some more. And if you're like me, you spend weeks and months studying the subject.Even though this book is set in the Charleston, South Carolina area, I went so far as to move to Natchez, Mississippi for three months. I had friends there who helped me find a house to rent while I absorbed all I immersed myself in the local culture and visited museums. I even worked for a seamstress while I was there...one who specialized in making antebellum costumes for the locals for tours every year. It was quite an education, and one I'm thrilled to have experienced.You see, history has always fascinated me, and I had long ago fallen in love with that era. Movies like Gone With the Wind, and Patrick Swayze's North and South were longtime favorites, and I knew that someday I would write a book set in that period. It would, of course, include the pretty dresses, and suave, handsome heroes...but not the Civil War. It would also have to express my distaste for slavery.So with those guidelines in mind, I started asking the 'what ifs.' What if you lost everything? Your home, your parents, even your fiance. What if you had nothing but your brother? And what if your long lost grandfather, a man who disowned his son long before you were born, suddenly left you the family estate in his will?That seemed like a fairly good beginning for a story, except I wasn't writing a fairytale. There needed to be more. So I asked a few more questions. What if the grandfather only left it to you because he set things up so you would lose it anyway? And to complicate it a little more, what if his sworn enemy was brought into the mess?And so Reluctant Guardian was born.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 741603, "title": "Reluctant Guardian", "author": "Kristy K.

To achieve this, scientists using social, developmental, cognitive, clinical and neuroscientific approaches must come together. This book is an inspiring demonstration of how this can be accomplished.\"--Mark D'Esposito, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology and Director, Henry H. Wheeler Jr. Brain Imaging Center, University of California, Berkeley\" In this outstanding volume, a stellar group of leading international researchers discuss the neural, mental and social processes involved in effective self control. They present cutting-edge research on this vitally important topic, covering the conscious as well as the unconscious mechanisms people employ to regulate their thoughts, feelings and actions. A better understanding of the psychology of self control is also critically important in applied fields such as clinical, counseling, organisational, health, marketing and sports psychology that all rely on effective self control strategies to achieve their objectives. This volume provides a comprehensive and illuminating review of the latest advances in this fascinating field, and should become essential reading for researchers, students and practitioners in psychology and related disciplines.\"-- Joseph P. Forgas, Scientia Professor, The University of New South Wales\"The mechanisms of self control are being revealed by imaging studies. This volume reviews these striking new findings and examines the many fields influenced by the new mechanistic approach to the problem of volition.

Il a prédit entre autres la fusée interplanétaire, le sous-marin, l’hélicoptère, le radar, la télévision, les satellites. Un cratère de la face cachée de la lune a été nommé Jules Verne.Quelque temps avant de mourir, Jules Verne remit cinq manuscrits à son éditeur Hetzel. À la demande de ce dernier, tous les textes furent remaniés par Michel, le fils du célèbre auteur, et vendus sous cette version jusqu’à ce jour. La Société Jules-Verne découvrit les manuscrits d’origine, mettant ainsi au jour la supercherie. Elle a confié leur publication et la vente de leurs droits de traduction dans le monde entier en exclusivité aux Éditions Stanké.", "related": ["B005Q3DNA0"], "rank": 54842, "title": "Famille-sans-nom (French Edition)", "author": "Jules Verne", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Blaine herself is mentally unbalanced--\"Maniac-Depressive,\" according to her analyst--and though the story is told in the third person, its omniscient narrator seems to suffer, if that's the word, from the very lack of balance attributed to Blaine herself. At times, its voice could be called \"stream of consciousness,\" but that well-worn phrase doesn't fully capture the lyrical spirit of this story, in the middle of which Roberts throws readers a bone with a surprisingly plain-spoken flashback that depicts Blaine's rise as a poet of no small accomplishment. In the end, the pervasive cold of winter--the story's second major character--contrasts with the lingering suggestion of warmth evinced by Roberts's language, creating a counterweight to the polar nature of Blaine's own state of mind as she hurtles toward the story's quietly dramatic conclusion. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00JERUXHK"], "rank": 783289, "title": "Hazy Shade of Winter (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Chris Roberts", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.1429, "rating_total": 22.0}

Her novels combine courtship plots with vividly-realized settings and demure social satire.  Bridge went on to write novels around a serious investigation of modern historical developments.  In the 1970s Bridge began to write thrillers centered on a female amateur detective, Julia Probyn, as well writing travel books and family memoirs. Her books were praised for their faithful representation of foreign countries which was down to personal experience and thorough research.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why, they are friendly little oranges that have been transformed into living, walking, talking, intelligent creatures, capable of loving, and caring about others, and each other. They eat flowers and seeds, nuts and berries. They have arms and legs, and can run, jump,and climb, much like you and me, but they are only the size of an orange. Orples were created by accident, but now that they're here, they are eager to join us humans, in learning all they can about everything they see.  Come. Join them in their adventures and read all about them. They'd love it if you do.My first book,How Orples Came To Bewas actually written over twenty-five years ago, when I was trying to find closure over my own father's death.  What began as a conversation among imaginary friends, evolved into a book. As the years passed,  the manuscript was pulled out of storage, re-read, and deemed worthy of sharing. The original hand drawn illustrations were replaced with Corel drawings, and the first edition of the book, offered today, is a result of some of the same emotions, we all experience as we walk through life.My first book touches on loneliness, internal battles between right and wrong, friendship, loyalty, and the love between a parent and a child. Even though, these books are written with children in mind,How Orples Came To Bewould be appropriate for a lot of adults that have lost sight of the gift they have when they have children of their own.The sequel books---Book 2: The Orples Make a Tree Home, andBook 3: The Orples Learn to Read,are meant to inspire children to think outside of the box, and to realize that through reading books, the world will always be at their fingertips.These titles are also available in e-book format for those who prefer Kindle.

My Mother, however, knowing that the way would not be smooth, stored that dream in her own heart, and insisted that I always bring home top grades.  When I was ready to apply to college, two of my teachers worked on my behalf to secure a scholarship from the state department of education in WV for me.  With that scholarship, and working at various jobs during my college career, and superhuman effort on the part of my Mother, I did earn that teaching certificate, and returned to the school I attended  in childhood, and became a teacher.  I earned an MA in Special Education, and an Ed. D. in Educational Administration, and eventually became a teacher trainer on the college level.

Unemployed and with too much time on his hands, Ken  can't resist the prospect of adventure or cash. He takes the case, only to  find himself the prime suspect when a member of the Japanese mafia turns up  dead and in several pieces. To exonerate himself, Ken must find the real  killer, and his inexpert gumshoeing tangles him in a complicated plot involving strippers, gangsters, and the World War II-era Japanese  \"relocation\" camps.The Anthony Award-winningDeath in Little Tokyointroduces  \"the very first Japanese-American amateur sleuth mystery series written by a Japanese-American.\" Ken Tanaka is a welcome addition; he's  likable, charming, nerdish, and unfailingly polite around old people and the  police. He has a gently self-effacing sense of humor and a girlfriend, Mariko,  who is an actress struggling against the lack of parts for Asian Americans.  Set in Los Angeles's Little Tokyo, the mystery unfolds around interesting little lessons on subjects as wide-ranging as woodblock prints, Latino culture, the game of Go, Japanese American history and social ritual,  and the intricacies of plotting a mystery weekend. The city and  neighborhood are evoked in especially vivid detail; food, in particular, is lovingly described. This is the commendable debut of a refreshing, somewhat less-than-gritty new voice.--R.

He could see and hear the bloody, violent scene, feel his mother's fear, his father's wrath, know both their thoughts, but could do naught to stop the mad fury being played out before him. He strove to cry out, but no sound came forth.\"Jamison, I beg you, do not do this thing!\"Nora MacLaurin shouted. Prone on the floor of her bedchamber, she fought to free herself from the death grip another of the men had on her arms. He yanked hard, nearly forcing them from their sockets. She screamed in agony.Jamison Maclean, already on his knees between her splayed legs, bent forward and swung hard, slapping her still-too-lovely face with the back of his hand. The knight's ring he wore opened her bottom lip, mixing her blood with that of the others' on his skin.Nora began to keen then.\"Please,\"she mewled, keeping her face turned away from the monster who had fathered her bairn. Without warning, the large, blood-encrusted hand of her captor covered her mouth and nose.\"Hold her down!\"Jamison instructed.\"Do not let this bitch's claws at my face again!\"And then he swiftly unlaced his braies and lifted her legs high over his shoulders.She attempted to kick him free, her cries muffled by the suffocating, calloused palm across her face. \"Aye, fight me--it makes the sport that much more gratifying!\"He rammed himself into her then, with bruising force, wanting to cause pain, not pleasure, to this faithless, beautiful woman who'd ruined his life.Nora's entire body went rigid.Jamison relished her reaction to his dry entry.\"You shall have her next, lad,\"he promised the youngest of his men, who'd not got his chance with the young maid downstairs before she'd perished.\"Your father liked it not that I fucked you before his eyes, did he, sweeting?\"Jamison cruelly asked. He pushed deeper still, satisfied when she went rigid once again.\"But worry not, he's dead now--lost his head and his manhood this day!\"Frantic now, she began to struggle with a force that would either free her or break her bones--she cared not which. Her only interest in that instant was to liberate herself from the beast that rutted between her legs.Daniel tried to run to his mother, but he could not force his feet to move. He was there, but not there. Knowing what was to come, yet powerless to change it, he watched the vile scene as it continued to unfold.Long minutes later, after the last man finished with her, his father leaned down and sliced her throat, wiping the dirk's bloody blade on the hem of her torn, stained, gown.\"'Tis the best way to stop a woman's infernal bleating, I trow,\"he said.The men laughed at their leader's jest.With the familiar heavy weight of fury and despair crushing his chest, Daniel grew desperate in his need to get to his father, to kill the beast that had cold-heartedly cut short the lives of those he held dear. Fighting his body's torpor, he tried with greater force to propel himself forward into the scene.* * *Maryn woke with a start. Tortured, guttural sounds were coming from her husband's throat.The hearth fire offered the only light in the room, but 'twas enough for her to see his face. She raised up on her elbow and looked down at him. \"Daniel?\" she said softly, worriedly. He did not answer her. She touched her hand to his face. It was dripping with sweat! And his entire frame was atremble. Alarmed now, she looked into his open, fear-glazed eyes, but there was no recognition in them. \"Daniel! Daniel, wake up!\" she said, and grabbing his shoulder, she shook it forcefully.He bolted upright.She squealed and fell away from him.His chest heaved with his rapid intake of breath as he pressed the base of his palms against his eyes, but he said naught.Maryn's heart beat fiercely against her ribs. She placed a hand over it and raised the other to his back in a calming caress.His voice was grim when he finally spoke. \"Go back to sleep, Maryn,\" he said. \"I'm fine. I just had a bad dream; 'tis over now.\"But Maryn was much too shaken to go back to sleep. Besides, she wanted to know what preyed on her husband's mind so insidiously that he was visited by it in his slumber. \"What on earth were you dreaming of?\" she asked gently.\"'Tis none of your concern,\" he replied, his tone harsh. \"Just...go back to sleep as I told you to do.\" He jerked out of her grasp then, as if he could no longer bear her touch, and rolled out of bed. He hauled on only his tunic before storming out the door without another word to her.Heartsick and thoroughly confused, stunned tears gathered in Maryn's eyes. Daniel had hurt her deeply. And she had been so blissfully happy prior to his stinging words--his abrupt departure. What had made him turn so cold, so distant, toward her? Was it the dream that had affected him so? She wondered again at the content of it. The terror he'd been in prior to waking was proof enough that his slumber was haunted by foes, not friends. Her heartache at his churlish behavior eased, and in its place, sympathy grew.But why would he not tell her of his terrors? Should a wife not share her husband's burdens, whether they be physical or spiritual? She ached to help him find his ease, but knew he was in no mood now to suffer further questions from her.She at last resolved to simply let time bring them closer.  Surely, after they'd spent more nights like the one just past, he would learn to trust her with his deepest thoughts and feelings.  She resolved to tear down his defenses with a loving hand.  She smiled to herself at the thought.  After all, was that not the truest way to slay a giant?* * *", "related": ["B007RB318S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of my books are based on real places and in some cases on real events, although the places and events are fictionalized.Fictional characters live only because the reader can relate to them and I do my best to make that easy. I hope you enjoy reading my books and feel free to me or use the contact information at the left if you have any comments or questions.I was born and raised in Decatur, Illinois, but moved to the Moweaqua area around 1991. I like small towns and rural settings, as does my wife of thirty-six years, Barbara. We have two grown children, John and Anna to whom I dedicated my first book, The First Suitor. Now after over thirty years of practicing law I would like to write full time, but yet I find myself full time in the law and part time in writing. I enjoy telling stories and some would say that all lawyers are born fiction writers, because fiction is all they write in the first place. I have to admit that there is some truth to that.Recently I have retired from the private practice of law and now work for the United States Department of Justice. I have now relocated to Louisville, Kentucky.I try to draw on my experiences in the practice of law and my life experiences in general to give realism to my stories and characters. In the 1970s I served in the U.S. Army as a Military Policeman and in the late '80s, I was a Captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, Army National Guard. I have been to Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and many of the United States. I like to work the settings of the places I've been and things I've done into my stories.I am foremost and always an entertainer and that is why I write fiction, but I try to make it real and believable as well as entertaining.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her job is part of a program to rediscover human colonies lost during a decades-long exodus through an alien artifact known as \"the Pelman point\" where for a long time ships could travel to interstellar space, but had no way of knowing where they were going and no way of getting back.When Yearby is captured by Kargian warriors and made into a sex slave by them, she does not adapt well, coming from the more egalitarian society of Earth. She escapes many times and is recaptured many times, getting plenty of opportunity to learn much about Karg and Kargians, especially what it's like to be a Kargian slavegirl (hint: lots of sex, lots of being bound and gagged, not much in the way of clothing).Whether it's the primitive sexual bondage rituals of a nameless tribe of swamp dwellers, or the slavegirl bondage catfights staged in the Fighting Pits of Kanorga, or in a slavegirl sex spectacle held by a Kargian army on the eve of battle, Yearby discovers that the life of a Kargian slavegirl is never dull!", "related": ["B00I5NIUCO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Countess Katherine \"Kat\" de Montrain (who occasionally runs with Robin's band as Lady Greensleeves) is a spoiled woman who, Drake implies, needs a good spanking (from the right man) to set her straight. She meets her match in Damian Montjoy, Count Clifford, sent home from the Crusades by King Richard to marry her and oppose Prince John's bid for power. Damian, disguised as the Silver Sword, arrives just in time to steal Kat away from the prince, who is scheming to marry her off to an evil crony. Not recognizing her captor and hoping to avoid marrying Damian, whom she had once unpleasantly encountered, Kat offers to sleep with the Silver Sword if he'll let her run away. He accepts but later denies the deal and leaves her to explain to an outraged Damian why she's not a virgin. But it is only a matter of time until their respective secret identities are revealed and Kat realizes she's been duped.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2007, after a lifetime's obsession with reading books, she decided to try and write one herself. The result was Dancing with the Ferryman which was published in 2011. This story was inspired by her life on the island of Whalsay in Shetland. The positive feedback she received from this encouraged her to carry on writing and in 2013 she published Dancing in Phoenix Park. She started writing this book during the 18 months she spent living in Ireland. She completed the novel after moving back to Shetland and finishing her Masters. She now writes a regular column for The Shetland Times newspaper, and teaches creative writing. She also works for a civil engineering company in Lerwick, just to keep her sane.", "related": ["B006IEWH1M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A.M.:  Er... right.  Well, I'm calling to let you know you can pick up my luxury Ford Focus at Starbucks near the interstate. Boss:  Why ever would I want to do that? A.M.:  Because I quit!

My own 5th grader has been enticed by the danger and intrigue the story-line promises and is excited to start it.As a parent, I appreciate that this book offers young readers that edgy danger factor, without also including the bad language and poor role models that often inhabit tween literature and love that this book appeals to boys.Hawaii Book Blog 9/6/12:Sorenson does a good job of taking a somewhat unlikable main character at the book's beginning and show growth and a change to his initial prejudices of people and situations. There are also good lessons in the story on the importance of teamwork and not judging people based on looks or preliminary perceptions.I could see this being a fun and exciting read for tween age boys, so long as they understand that Uncle Tom's perceptions  are more or less the wrong ones and that they should not go out and seek to stop dangerous criminal behavior--whether real or imagined.Pasadena Star-News 9/2/12: Adventure-seeking tweens ages 9-14 will enjoy the e-book, ISLAND DANGER.  When Todd, a 14-year-old soccer player in Hawaii, learns that militant activists have hidden weapons in the ravine to use for a rebellion against the U.S. government, he creates a plan to find them and gain his family's respect.  But not everything's as it seems.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As I got into the story, I was devastated as to how selfish he was to insist that she leave behind the people of her nationality and live his life with him among his race. I am a black woman. He, as much as wanted her to remove all traces of where she had come from, besides for the way she cooked. I know that I wouldn't have been able to do that for the love of a man, like that.The sex scenes were many, but I felt they could have been a little more in depth.  I liked the way you stringed along my imagination, but I didn't seem to get enough. I wanted more.... more.... Overall, I give this book a (four)4. There were a few scenes; I did not care too much for, but a great story overall. I felt and lived the story along with them.

Like any boy of my age, I wore sleeveless tank tops, which were short, and shorts which were long. I would prick tar bubbles in the street and long to be a mythical hero with winged sandals and the patronage of Athena. It was not to be.  I had a blessedly traditional education at St John's C of E School and was a chorister though I never stunned with a top C, nor, as a boy scout did I have my arms poulticed with badges. However, I did well enough and had the scabbed knees of a proper boy instead.  At eleven, I won a scholarship to QEGS where I found myself to be a very small fish, and where class came to matter quite painfully at first. There was some mediocre teaching but I was lucky enough to be nurtured from the third form onward by three inspirational masters. I was rather good at French and English, but abysmal at Maths. I loved Latin but found it unnecessarily hard and would go into reveries about how ancient Romans could possibly have spoken to each other with any fluency: ‘ I'll have those dormouse pies, please. Wait while I fiddle in my purse for a few sesterces and stick the verb at the end.’  My nicknames were ‘Twig’, after a character in a forgotten play, and ‘Plum’ in the Sixth Form, thanks to the Beano.  I did a lot of acting. My first role was as a milkmaid (in French) though I graduated to Prince Hal in Henry IV. I went up to Downing College, Cambridge to read English, having never been further south than Pwlleli.  At first, I was unhappy and thought I should have been at drama school, but I soon became bedazzled by it all. I was too young to appreciate all this and no doubt prodigally wasted much of my youth. But that is not a new story. Life accelerates, or living it does.   I have taken risks, lost out and been on the skids in the suburbs. I have worked as a deputy hotel manager, a doctors’ receptionist, office manager to a scaffolding firm, and as an auxiliary nurse in a geriatric ward. I now teach English at a school in Lincoln under the shadow of the most beautiful cathedral in Europe. In Winter I can see it from the garden; it invites me to aspire. I wish I had more time to write.", "related": [], "rank": 4991460, "title": "The Mouse Triptych eBook", "author": "Ian Thomson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It provides a step forward in this new and vibrant field of research.Carmen Lujan Garcia, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, English World-WideThe volume English as an International Language presents an inspired inquiry into the multifaceted role of Englishes for global communication. It builds on and goes beyond the existing knowledge on a wide range of topics related to the use, attitudes, pedagogy, and conceptualization of Englishes in the world. The strength of the book lies in the insightful discussions from multiple vantage points and unique critical perspectives. Ryuko Kubota, The University of North Carolina at Chapel HillThis carefully selected volume of essays makes a valuable contribution to the study of the contemporary sociolinguistics of English and English teaching across cultures. It brings together multiple theoretical and methodological approaches underscoring the richness of its subject. In doing so, it offers an overview of some of the competing paradigms that guide research on English in multilingual settings, suggesting theoretical continuities in and methodological challenges to the field. The collection provides insight into teaching practitioners' pedagogical engagement by illustrating their search for equity in the workplace, their linguistic self-representation in the field and classroom, and the preparation they gain in EIL in higher education institutions. The book provides much evidence of the interdisciplinarity of EIL research, particularly how various disciplines can offer new ways of understanding major processes within it such as English indigenization, cross-cultural communication, and language use.The volume is a very valuable resource for researchers and students in English studies, second language acquisition, and English language pedagogy.

In 1980, having bought and lived on a yacht during leave periods for several years, he became a full time professional yacht skipper.

During this period, he wrote a series of articles for Navy International and became involved in the campaign to preserve HMS Plymouth. In 2000, with his wife, he carried out a resurrection of an old, derelict motor sailor that they then cruised until family concerns required a permanent presence in the UK.

My favorite parts of the book is his candid nature in which he\nwrites it and the summary bullet points at the end of each chapter. Each\nchapter covered great areas of struggle, most of which deal with\nmindset/mentality, but in the end you are left with in-your-face inspirational\nquotes and sayings and words of advice.

Much of the information in this book is compiled from validated ancient records dating as far back as can be researched. Dr. Dey has lived a diverse and interesting life. As a young man he worked in the field of computer technology at a time when computers were just beginning to make their way into large corporations and becoming useful in military applications. While working for General Motors Research laboratories and serving in the United States Naval Reserve, he continued his college education on a part time basis. After college he attended professional school at Palmer College of Chiropractic and graduated with a Degree of Doctor Of Chiropractic. He continued pursuing education in the healing arts and became certified, and subsequently registered, as a clinical hypnotherapist. Before and after his years as a Chiropractic physician he worked as a science teacher and medical instructor at various educational institutions. His great interest in religion and spirituality grew as a result of practicing in the field of hypnotherapy. As a devout Christian he was torn between hypnosis, which he knew to be an extremely helpful adjunct to any healing arts practice, and his Christian faith which considers hypnosis to be wicked and devilish. This conflict between his practice and his religion was greatly responsible for him commencing the in-depth study of religious history that resulted in the writing of this book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the mystery unravels, the first-person narration forges\nan important bond between reader and lead character, whose wit and sarcasm\nendear him to the reader. The writing is polished and practical. What really\ngrabbed me was the dialogue, which captures the essence of a conversation\nwithout insulting the readers' intelligence. Albrecht shows his skill and\nprecision as an author when he summarizes the protagonist's back story later in\nthe book, rather than pummeling the reader upfront with a lengthy biography. I\nwas also impressed with Albrecht's pacing and chapter breaks.

Picture \"24\" (the TV series), meets all the secrets and insights and real-life mysteries of a whispered backstage tour, meets your best day at the park.

He spent some time working in Reston and McLean, Virginia, but only officially worked for the government as a security contractor. Thomas has performed technology and security work for several fortune 500 companies, most recently Wells Fargo Bank.Along the way, he's founded a private security company, an Internet Service Provider and a K-8 Charter School.

Esa afirmación no es solo un mito, es una mentira. Y causa mucho\ndaño en parejas que se niegan a la maduración que el verdadero amor exige,\ndejando al mismo Dios a un nivel de hada madrina y no de Maestro del amor como\ncorresponde. En mi maravillosa e\nintensa vivencia del matrimonio lo que sí he descubierto con mi esposa, y con\nlos amigos que recorren esta misma vía es que lo que sí existe son (somos)\nsobrevivientes de la materia, parejas que llevan y sobrellevan su relación un\ndía a la vez, con la misma intensidad de una batalla campal donde el\ningrediente principal para seguir es el amor verdadero, y con él y por él,\npoder sobrevivir a todo tipo de adversidad, (sin este ingrediente divino es\nbatalla perdida)  descubriendo juntos su\nfuerza en la unión contra todo lo que pretenda destruirlos, interno y externo,\nque no es poco, ahí están las estadísticas que lo comprueban, recordando que en\nel nuestros países, lo real supera siempre por mucho a lo oficial. Lo cierto es que no\nqueríamos dejar pasar más tiempo antes de que nuestra memoria diera por hecho  y sentado algo que fue tan significativo y\ntrascendental para mí y para mi apostolado en esta breve vida, y por eso paso a\nplasmarlo en letras.Porque aún recordamos,\npor eso lo escribimos, y lo podemos comprobar además en las canciones que son fieles\ntestigos y compañeras de este proceso de amor. Tengo la certeza, y he\nprocurado no olvidarlo jamás, que con este tema de encontrar a \"mi pareja\", no\nsolo me vinculé con Dios para sacarlo adelante, (una vez que tuve mi encuentro\ncon Él), sino que definitivamente le di la lata de mi vida como a nadie, (digo,\n¿a quien más se la daba?) e inclusive, lo confieso a gusto finalmente, llega a\nser hasta un poco vergonzoso el recordarlo, pero como sea funcionó. Por lo que\nhoy, casi 26 años después, corresponde retomar y dejar el testamento de nuestra\nexperiencia a los que vengan. En esto de las\nrelaciones de pareja, lo relativo, como tiene que ser, va de la mano con cada\ncaso, lo que para algunos al parecer es cosa fácil para otros no lo es en\nabsoluto, y lo que algunos pueden esperar que sea un asunto fácil\n(ingenuamente) tampoco termina siéndolo, pues esto del matrimonio requiere una\natención de 24 horas al día hasta que la muerte los separe, y no basta quedarse\ncon la apariencia de que todo va bien.La fuerza y la\nfragilidad del matrimonio crean un balance tan perfecto que eso explica porque\nel mejor reflejo de Dios sea La Familia, Alianza de Dios en los hombres (lo que\nexplica, por cierto, también lo contrario, la falta del reflejo de Dios y sus\nconsecuencias).", "related": [], "rank": 1675537, "title": "Auxilio!, me cas...con un msico.

Dayis a\ndelightful book for children around the ages of 6-8. He has authored\nseveral other published works for young adults but this was one of his\nfirst works for children from what I could see from my research.\nObviously as it is a bedtime read I would prefer the hard copy version\nand since I had seen other good reviews for it I borrowed it from a\nfriend who had it and chose two test subjects to red it to. To my\nsurprise, they wanted to read the book themselves and easily read\nthrough it. Both of the children are 7 years old; one is a boy and the\nother is a girl.The book is about the adventures of a bear who\nhas a very different outlook on live as he traverses the woods looking\nfor new adventures and friends. He constantly reflects on what happens\nand shows great judgement and character. It is a very good book in that\nit not the typical type of 'preachy' book where the author is constantly\n trying to shove a moral story down children's necks. Instead this book\nvery cleverly shows how Bear goes through his adventures and gives and\ninteresting thought process behind his actions...Overall I give it a3 out of 4 stars.\n The story was very appropriate for children their age however some\nother things such as onomatopoeia and other literary devices that\nchildren love could have been used to create a more vivid imagery.Review from the OnlineBookClub.comforums.onlinebookclub.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t;=13476&sid;=f423f3ee76c0c1ea78245d0e6a1eab5e", "related": [], "rank": 4271765, "title": "Red Bear and the Indian Chief (The Misadventures of Red Bear Book 1)", "author": "Paul Day", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Over the years this man has been getting more shades to his personality, more definition to his thoughts and more weight to his (non)existence. His story has been coming to me in a strange way from the beginning - in bits and pieces but never complete. He does not have a face when I picture him, he does not have a past, his life has no events - but he has his words and those words are that I write whether as frustrating drafts for stories I couldn't complete or in poems that seem complete but have little to show about him.He has become almost like an obsession for me, an idea in my head that I cannot shake off. In that sense I have to write his words whenever they come to me or else I will lose them the next moment.But there is a different joy in writing and that is what feel in this poem. It is short but it is true to what I feel, what he may feel each time he takes up his pen and paper to write. I love this story, and I hope everyone else will love it too.Also, the bonus poems are just among the tidbits I have written over the past two years - some quite earlier and some nearer to now.Happy reading everyone - and I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I did working on it!", "related": [], "rank": 4047088, "title": "Burning Muse eBook", "author": "Shambhawi P", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book will be of great value to our understanding of how effective emotionally-focused group work can act as a growth-facilitating environment for optimizing brain circuits in the ‘social’ ‘emotional’ right brain, the biological substrate of the human unconscious mind. It also serves as a theoretical source for the development of evidence-based, yet clinically sound group psychotherapy models.\"\"This clearly and beautifully written collection of peer reviews and previously published articles concerning the interpersonal neurobiology of group psychotherapy and group process is essential reading. Interpersonal neurobiology is a source of a fuller understanding of people in groups, groups in people, and especially of the web of affiliations that structure communicational networks and the information carried through them. This is necessary for the development of our theory and clinical practice. Interpersonal neurobiology underpins the deeper study of the social unconscious, including the development of the social brain and its effects on people in relationships and vice versa.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And there is a great cast-list of contributors. Highly recommended. Professor Ronald Carter, School of English, University of Nottingham, UK Just under a quarter of the material for the book [.] has been written by Tomlinson. This is indicative of his iconic status in the area of Materials Development ... In his role as editor Tomlinson has collected a star-studded cast of contributors ... ideal for graduate students of MA or MSc programmes in TESOL, as each chapter contains excellent overviews of current scholarship, and seeks to link these, when possible, to classroom practice. -- Gregory Hadley, Niigata University of International and Information Studies Systems 20131118", "related": [], "rank": 2461625, "title": "Applied Linguistics and Materials Development", "author": "Brian Tomlinson", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Huntington calls 'praetorianism'—control of society by force or fraud, especially by venal, corruptible, and often sycophantic people; into what Richard Joseph calls 'prebendalism'—the disbursing of public offices and state rents to one's ethnic-based clients; and into what Larry Diamond calls 'uncivil society'—lacking the horizontal relations of reciprocity and cooperation that breed the honesty, trust, and law abidingness that mark the civic community. The aforementioned descriptions of Nigeria raised the specter of a failed state. Campbell (Ralph Bunche Senior Fellow for Africa Policy Studies, Council on Foreign Relations), former US ambassador to Nigeria, cites numerous factors responsible for this situation: endemic corruption, maladministration, election malpractices, and sectarian violence perpetrated by Boko Haram. Campbell condemns Washington's indifference in the past and cautions the Obama administration to be circumspect in helping Nigerian civil society in reversing this trend. A must-read for people interested in security of Nigeria and US-Nigeria bilateral relations; recommended for other readers. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduate, graduate, research, and professional collections.(CHOICE)[A] bold and courageous book. . . .Campbell sounded the alarm bell [but] we ignored the clear and prompt message contained, instead we went ahead to demonise the messenger. . . .If Nigeria continues to be the epicentre of corruption, infrastructure decay, violent conflict, religious extremism and criminality, there is not much anyone can do to improve her image. I earnestly hope that our country wins the war against terror which will possibly begin with the safe return of the girls kidnapped from Chibok. It is now clear that Campbell was right in most of the issues he raised. . . .The lesson is that we must try to give some of the many ‘western’ discussions about Nigeria the benefit of informed scrutiny before discarding them as promoters of pre-conceived interests.(Punch)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book is awesome. But the cover bothers me\nonly because it shows a child who is sucking on a pacifier. In the story\n the young boy is going to school but the cover doesn't show that. If I\ndidn't read the blurb I probably wouldn't pick up this book because of\nthe cover. If I was to rate this book just based on the cover I would do\n a four. But being as my ratings go on the story and not the cover it is\n a 5 star rating for me.\nNow on to the story. I love how this book shows that everyone is\ndifferent. Everyone has different eyes, and this book shows that. Which I\n think is perfect for kids to understand. This book was really good for\nmy son being as he is 7 and in the learning stage of how everyone is\ndifferent with either hair, skin color, now eyes after reading this,\npeople with disabilities. It made talking with my son a lot easier as to\n why people are different. . After reading Almond Eyes he noticed that\neveryone has different eye shape and not just eye color. He actually was\n telling his father about the book.\nK's favorite part in the book was everyone's eye shape was different. I\nthink because he has not seen a lot of different eye shapes before.\nThe illustrations are perfect I loved every one of them.  Very colorful.\nThis is a book I would recommend to everyone, because it seems to have a\n good lesson within it. Everyone is different, and you can become\nfriends with all.", "related": [], "rank": 3941984, "title": "Almond Eyes", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No one has ever heard of Stayner, so she usually tells people she lives “near Collingwood” and no, she doesn’t ski at Blue Mountain or at all, in fact she’s not even fond of snow.   She began her writing career in 2006 and since her first published works in 2009 she hasn’t stopped.  Jacqueline describes her writing as “all things paranormal”, which she has proven is her niche with stories of witches, ghosts, physics and shifters now on the shelves.  When Jacqueline isn’t working at her ‘reality job’ or lost in her writing she spends time with her five children, most of whom are finally able to look after her instead of the other way around.  Together they do random road trips, that usually end up with them lost,  shopping trips where they push every button in the toy aisle, hiking when there’s enough time to escape and bizarre things like creating new daring recipes in the kitchen. She’s a grandmother to four (so far) and looks forward to corrupting many more in the years to come. Jacqueline loves to hear from her readers, you can find her at www.jacqpaige.webs.com , www.jacqpaige.blogspot.ca  or http://magicseasonsbooks.blogspot.ca", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was one of history's longest standoffs.\nTwo of the mightiest military power blocs the World has ever seen faced each\nother across a ribbon of land which became the heaviest defended stretch of\nterritory since the trenches of World War 1. The Inner German Border.\nOn one side NATO, with a concentration of force which never\ndissipated after victory over Nazi Germany at the end of World War 2. Operating\nfrom hardened bunkers and aircraft shelters, life was a long rehearsal for\nWorld War 3. On the other side The Warsaw Pact engaged in a struggle to impose\ncommunism on unwilling satellites trying to match a technically superior foe by\nsheer weight of numbers.To understand the motivations of the men who flew the iconic\nPhantom, you need to appreciate what went on in their daily lives on the ground\nand in the air. The Phantom and the Su27 are characters in this story and they\nbecome pawns in the chess match. In the Su27 Flanker, the Soviets have a\nfighter which has the potential to redress the technological balance and if the\nWest can exploit its secrets, the delicate balance may tip in its favour.In an intricate tale of Cold war intrigue and duplicity, the\nplot takes you from a secret test facility on the outskirts of Moscow to the heart\nof an active airbase, RAF Wildenrath in West Germany with a brief stop in the\ncorridors of power. A defector who bolts with his high tech prototype fighter\nmay invoke political strategies on a grand scale but doesn't life always have a\nway of making things personal?Could it have happened? The plot is fictional but the\ndescriptions are real. Strange things undoubtedly did occur such as Viktor\nBelenko landing his Mig 25 Foxbat in Japan in 1976. By the end of this book\nyou'll know what it was like to fight the Cold War as I take you into the\ncockpit with a level of detail that could only come from having flown the mighty\nPhantom in NATO's Central Region.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father, a mathematician and a banker, taught him to read and write before the age of 5.  He discovered his love for writing by the time he was 10 years old and wrote vacation reports and several articles for the German school periodical “Hilf Mit.” When Horst was 10, he entered the “Jungvolk,” a subdivision of the Hitler Youth, which was mandatory in the Berlin school system.  He then entered the Hitler Youth at the age of 14, also mandatory, and continued writing for the Hitler Youth periodicals “Der Pimpf” and “Die Deutsche Jugend Burg.” His favorite pastime was playing in the U-Bahn (subway) tunnels.  While other children played soccer, Horst, with a few other likeminded children, explored Berlin by riding the subway trains. Drafted to help defend Berlin against the Soviets at the age of 14 because of his unique knowledge of the subway system, he served as a guide for various SS demolition commandos. In the early 1950s, Horst immigrated to the United States and became a US citizen after the mandatory 5-year waiting period.  He loves to travel and has visited all 50 states in the US, most of Europe, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and some Central American countries.  He now resides with his wife Jennifer of 41 years, in Northern California, where he has been for the last thirty years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 35.0}

They share a deep fascination with the human condition, with “Cultural Potholes” – the unseen or ignored parts of human existence that cause so much damage – and with the differences that have evolved between men and women. They are proud to call themselves Evolutionary Behaviorists. BrainLines was one of their first collaborations and the foundation of their later work together. Their investigation of these physical markers of brain hemisphere influence, building on the decades of Donna’s previous observations, continued through the years, as they used their knowledge in all their interactions with other people. They found BrainLines to be so useful that they knew they had to share their findings in this book. Donna & Paul’s other work includes environmental activism (www.MowAndSow.org); peace activism involving women (www.BaringWitness.org); using Darwinian sexual selection theory to teach women about their innate ability to select and guide their mates (www.SeductionRedefined.com), which led to the idea of producing a documentary film (www.TheEveOption.org); and a series of panels, workshops and newspaper articles that bring to light some of the most insidious and damaging Cultural Potholes (www.CulturalPotholes.com). Donna co-founded a community radio station (www.KWMR.org) and they have co-created interactive art installations and an award that honors the great women that stand beside great men – the Dolley Madison Partnership Award.  They have been interviewed and featured internationally on television, radio, the Internet and in documentary films.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By day I’m training young women to become speech therapists. At night I sip red wine, dial down all distractions, and sink into the fictional worlds I create. Good tunes on my iPod are a must. I get so caught up in my characters that I truly wish the male hero would materialize in the flesh; especially when I see the cover image…I swoon. I have spent the past several years working as a university instructor. My students are young adult females so I’m constantly running plot lines and book covers by them. They make a great beta team!  I love my job at the university but there is something I love even more. . . romance novels. I'll read any genre as long as there are steamy sex scenes and the standard issue HEA ending. Initially I was drawn in by the escape and sweeping emotion of it all, so much so, I began to create my own fictional world. Since I worked during the day my nights were consumed with writing. I was powerless to stop the stories that wanted to be freed from my mind. I actually started to get mixed up. I would think something I wrote at night was something I had said during the working day and vice versa. My friends were worried for my sanity but I assured them I had not gone mad, I was just writing. Once I started I wrote upwards of 3,000 words per day. It was in the early millennium when I became brave enough to share my stories with others. I began to post my stories on fiction websites and then something marvelous happened—I was followed by hundreds of eager readers. I loved my followers and their kind words helped motivate me. These days I am writing books and I’ve learned some things about myself during the process. I like to write series novels because I have trouble letting go. I like a little plot with my romance, erotica, contemporary. Call it what you will, but I have to have a good story in which to sink my teeth. If I start writing a story I have to finish it, even if it’s terrible. My dog is my muse and when he tilts his forehead at me and blinks his large black eyes questioningly at me, I think he is worried I've been sucked into the wormhole of the very fiction that I write. I appreciate his concern but I have yet to fall down the rabbit hole.

It all began with a dream in which a scientist experimented with clones. With my background in biology, the science fiction aspect intrigued me. However, I wondered what other stories could be told when cloning has been covered many times and in many ways in books and movies. A question, part of my dream, haunted my daily steps. This was the question: \"Are men born evil? What if they got a second chance?\" In other words, will their evilness manifest if they are cloned? In a different environment, will the clone grow up to be a good person, perhaps even a Christian? I longed to explore the ethical questions, and I finally put pen to paper. Two more books are planned in which I will delve more fully into some of the ramifications from the decisions of my characters. Perhaps some of the conclusions readers will agree with; perhaps not. However, it's worth exploring. Unless the Lord comes soon, cloning of humans is on our horizon--actually, some scientists say cloned humans already walk among us!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.4444, "rating_total": 80.0}

In the past, David used to visit Puerto Rico during summer school breaks and his uncle would make him perform athletic feats such as: running 50 feet while holding a construction boulder, running laps on the track and field park at a local school and playing basketball. Johnny would recommend the certain types of food to eat and would mention other foods to stay away from because they did not provide any nutritional value.David listened and acknowledged the statements that Uncle Johnny provided but didn't fully grasp the meaning until much later in life. One year of intensive and frequent visits to all-inclusive resorts amounted to a 50 lb. weight gain. It was then, that the advice provided by Uncle Johnny resurfaced like a beacon in the night, prompting a change. The change would come by way of the, then newly introduced eating plan known as Paleo.

He spent his childhood in Florenville, a charming village in the south of Belgium.  After a diverse educational background (others would call erratic!) he began studying civil engineering and then realized that it did not suit him at all. He studied Political Science and International Relations at the University of Brussels. He loves to travel which has led him to visit a significant part of our planet, favoring the discovery of other people and respect for local cultures. He had the opportunity to discover the United States, China, most European countries, but also North Africa, a trip that remains almost as a nightmare for him. He worked in many sectors including rural development and education. Since 1996 he works in the social sector, mainly focusing on literacy for low level skilled people. For over ten years he has developed European projects in this field. He came late to writing, in fact to the publication of his writings because he feels he has always written. Till now he has published a trilogy called “In the Shadow of the Dragon.” Canal Bridge is his first novel and is published in French and English. After ten years in Brittany, he currently lives with his partner in Bordeaux.

I liked this idea because it really was different. I loved the description of a tree nymph, as described by the author. I loved the way the author said that tree nymphs looked like normal girls but that they had a special attachment to nature. And I loved the way the author said that a tree nymph could allow leaves to be greener and flowers to grow at her feet. It was just sweet and delightful to read and think about and it was new and different, even in a fantasy! I loved the subtle message that seemed to be implied, tree nymphs wanted to save their woods and preserve nature.

My children, Christopher, Michael, Thomas, and Katherine, kindly donated their names, characters, and ideas to this series of books.", "related": ["B00CC0XBZW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.5714, "rating_total": 32.0}
