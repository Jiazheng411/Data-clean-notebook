She reminded herself as she did so that she wasn't a naïve girl of just eighteen any more, who knew virtually nothing of the real world or the shadowed, darker side of life, a girl who had been sheltered and protected by her father's love and concern. No; she was a woman now, a woman of twenty-two, who knew exactly what the real world encompassed, exactly how much pain, poverty and degradation it could hold, as well as how much love, compassion and sheer generosity of spirit.Looking back over the last four years, it seemed almost impossible that she had anything left in common with the girl she had once been. Imogen closed her eyes and lay back in her seat, an economy-class seat, even though she could technically at least have flown home first class. You didn't do things like that when you had spent the last few years working to help destitute orphans who lived in a world where children under five would fight to the death over a scrap of bread. Now, thanks to the small private charitable organisation she worked for, some of those orphans at least were being given a roof over their heads, food, education and, most important of all in Imogen's eyes, love.Imogen couldn't pin-point exactly when she had first started to regret turning her back on her inheritance—not in any way for her own sake, but for what it could mean to the charity she worked for and the children she so much wanted to help.Perhaps it had begun when she had stood and watched the happiness light up the face of Sister Maria the day she had announced to them all, in a voice that trembled with thrilled gratitude, that the fund-raising they had all worked so hard on that year had raised a sum of money that was only a tithe of the income Imogen knew she could have expected from her inheritance—never mind its saleable value.All she did know was that increasingly over recent months she had begun to question the wisdom of what she had done and just how right she was to allow pride to stand in the way of all that she could do to benefit the charity.And, as if that weren't enough, she had begun, too, to wonder how her friends and fellow workers would view her if they knew how wilfully and indeed selfishly she was refusing to use her own assets where they could do so much good. Pride was all very well but who exactly was paying for her to have the luxury of indulging in it? These and other equally painful questions had been causing Imogen to battle within herself for far too long. And now finally she had come to a decision she felt ashamed to have taken so long in reaching.The nuns were so kind, so gentle, so humbly grateful for every scrap of help they received. They would never blame or criticise her, Imogen knew, but she was beginning to blame and criticise herself.During her years in Rio Imogen had learned to protect and value her privacy, to guard herself from any unwanted questions, however kindly meant. Her trust was not something she gave lightly to others any more. Her past was a taboo subject and one she discussed with no one.She had made friends in Rio, it was true, but her past was something she had kept to herself, and the friends she had made had all been kept at something of a distance— especially the men. Falling in love, being in love—these were things that hurt too much for her to even think about, never mind risk doing. Not after Dracco. Dracco. Even now she still sometimes dreamed about him. Dreams that drained her so much emotionally that for days afterwards she ached with pain.There was no one to whom she wanted to confide just how searing her sense of loss and aloneness had been when she had first arrived in the city, or just how often she had been tempted to change her mind and return home. Only her pride had stopped her—that and the letter she had sent to her father's solicitor a week after her arrival in Rio, informing him that she was disassociating herself completely from her past life. She had said that she wanted nothing to do with the inheritance her father had left her and that henceforward she wanted to be allowed to lead her own life, on her own. She had made her letter as formal as possible, stating that under no circumstances did she want any kind of contact with either her stepmother or Dracco.She had, of course, omitted to put any address on the letter, and as an added precaution she had used the last of the money Dracco had given her to fly to America, where she had posted her letter before returning to Rio.In order to support herself she had found work both as an interpreter and a teacher, and it had been through that work that she had become involved with the sisters and their children's charity.It had taken her what was now a guilt-inducing amount of time to bring herself to take the action she was now taking, and she still felt acutely ashamed to remember the look of bemused disbelief on Sister Maria's face when she had haltingly explained to her that she was not the penniless young woman she had allowed everyone to believe she was.Sister Maria's total lack of any attempt to question or criticise her had reinforced Imogen's determination to put matters right as speedily as she could.Initially she had believed that it would be enough simply for her to write to her father's solicitor, explaining that she had changed her mind about the income she could receive under her father's will. She had explained in the simplest possible terms how she wished to use it to benefit Rio's pitifully needy street children. It had distressed her to receive a letter back not from Henry Fairburn but from an unknown David Bryant. He had introduced himself in the letter as Henry's successor and nephew, explaining that his uncle had died and that he had taken over the business.As to Imogen's income from the inheritance left to her by her father, the letter had continued, he considered that because of the complications of the situation it would be necessary for her to return to England to put her wishes into action, and he had advised her to lose no time in doing so.Of course, she had baulked at the idea of returning home. But, after all, what was there really for her to fear other than her own fear?There was certainly no need for her to fear her long-dead love for Dracco. How could there be?There had been no contact between them whatsoever, and for all that she knew he and Lisa could now be living together in blissful happiness. They certainly deserved one another. She had never met two people who matched one another so exactly in terms of cold-bloodedness.It was a great pity that her father had seen fit to make Dracco one of her trustees and an even greater one that Henry, her other trustee, was no longer alive. Imogen wasn't quite sure just what the full legal position with regard to her inheritance and her rights was, but no doubt this David Bryant would be able to advise her on that. And on the other crumple in the otherwise smooth surface of her life that she really ought to get ironed out?That small and impossible-to-blank-out fact that she and Dracco were still legally, so far as she was aware, married?Disconcertingly the only gently chiding comment Sister Maria had made when Imogen had been explaining her situation had been a soft reminder that the vows of marriage were supposed to be for life!Foolishly she had never bothered to get their marriage annulled. She had been far too terrified in those early days that Dracco might somehow persuade her to return home and to their marriage.Now, of course, she had no such fear, and no need for the status of a single woman either, other than as a salve to her own pride, a final step into a Dracco-free future.She was also looking forward to, as she had promised she would, writing to Sister Maria to tell her that everything was going smoothly and that she would soon be returning to Rio.Her stomach muscles tensed with a nervous apprehension that she told herself firmly was entirely natural as the plane began its descent into Heathrow Airport.The Imogen who had left Heathrow four years earlier had been pretty in a soft, still-girlish way, but the woman she had become could never in a thousand years have been described as wishy-washily pretty. The hardship of a life that was lived without any kind of luxury, a life that was spent giving one hundred and fifty per cent physical commitment and two hundred and fifty per cent emotional love, had stripped Imogen's body of its late-teenage layer of protective flesh and honed her face to a delicately boned translucency. This revealed not just her stunningly perfect features and the deep, intense amethyst of her amazing eyes, but also gave her a luminosity that was almost spiritual and that made people turn to look at her not just once but a second and then a third time.She was dressed simply in soft chinos and a white cotton shirt, but no woman could possibly live in Rio without absorbing something of the sensuality of its people, of a culture that flagrantly and unselfconsciously worshipped the female form. Brazilian clothes were cut in a way that was unique, and not even the loose fit of what she was wearing could conceal the narrowness of Imogen's waist, the high curve of her breasts, the unexpected length of her legs, but most of all the rounded curve of her bottom. the South American sun, which had given her a warm, ripe, peachy glow. As she raised her hand to shield her eyes from the shaft of sunlight breaking through the grey cloud the gold watch her father had given her shortly before his death glinted in the light, emphasising the fragility of her wrist. A group of stewardesses walking past her looked enviously at the careless way she had tied the tangled thickness of her curls back off her face with an old white silk scarf.Taking a deep breath, Imogen summoned a taxi. Once inside it, she studied the piece of paper she had removed from her purse, and gave the address written on it to the driver.As he ...", "related": ["B0056HC9W4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Battle-scarred Vietnam vet Rainbow Porter dwells in ascetic solitude in the mountains above Albuquerque, tormented by his past and responsible to no one. A man of mysteriously independent means, he returns to the civilized world only when called upon to right some glaring injustice. His quiet existence is interrupted, however, by the appearance of April Bow, a Eurasian woman who fears that whoever set the trip-wired mine that killed her adoptive father, Rainbow's old war buddy Toker, may be after her as well. The pair travel across the Southwest, Mexico and Southeast Asia, making gruesome discoveries about each other and their shared past that jeopardize their growing love. A covert smuggling operation, a U.S. intelligence counter-operation, blackmail, deception and betrayal drive this intricately plotted narrative, which is charged with illicit sexual attraction and haunted by the ghosts of Vietnam. Campbell has all the makings of a top-notch genre writer.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After an ancient hanged body is revealed in a pub cellar during artillery practice, Dryden, a skilled investigative journalist, finds that other things in the deserted village are not quite right. Why is an old tomb partly open? What happened to the cellar's owner in the evacuation? Dryden soon bypasses the police and launches his own investigation, putting his safety at risk. The large number of interviewees and suspects can be confusing; many appear only once or twice and their characters are vague, but they supply vital information for the careful armchair sleuth. Kelly's evocative descriptions of the flat and misty fenlands meander through a revealing look at the deterioration of contemporary village life under the stress of large-scale agriculture and rural depression.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's part steampunk, part American tall tale, and part pseudo-Native American legend. The story begins with readers learning that Conker, John Henry's son who was thought to have died in The Nine Pound Hammer (Random, 2009) is alive, having been saved by Redfeather's magical copper necklace. The siren, Jolie (who also disappeared at the end of book one), takes him to a secret spring to nurse him back to health. Meanwhile, Nat, Si, Buck, Marisol, Ray, and the children they rescued from the Pitch Dark Train are living an idyllic life in the Smoky Mountains. Ray finishes his training and becomes a full-fledged Rambler. Life is reasonably comfortable until a dying stranger with pasty gray skin and motor oil in place of his blood comes to Shuckstack speaking of a terrible Darkness that is consuming the towns of the prairies. Ray and Marisol leave to investigate the Darkness, and Sally, Ray's sister, leaves to try and find her father. Meanwhile Conker and Jolie are trying to find the Nine Pound Hammer in order to repair it with wood from the fabled Wolf Tree that is a path into the spirit world. It is the only weapon that can destroy the Gog's evil Machine, which is causing the Darkness. Ultimately there is too much happening, and it is difficult to invest in either the characters or the story line. Recommended only where the first book is popular.–Heather M.

Indeed, it seems to open up lines of \"transcommunication\" as never before, Greer says, and messages from beyond the grave come in a multitude of formats, including dreams, friendly animals, rainbows and electrical disturbances. She offers examples, too, of departed loved ones taking a more active role-by counseling the living on life projects, helping them find apartments, even fixing them up with Mr. Right. Greer, a Redbook online sex columnist and author of Gridlock: Finding Courage to Move On in Life, Love and Work, describes herself as a \"psychoanalytically trained\" therapist, but departs from Freudian orthodoxy by collaborating with a psychic and urging her patients to directly contact their deceased relatives as an integral part of the therapeutic process. Her material is drawn mostly from their case studies, and from her experience with her own late mother, a particularly voluble spirit who manifests herself in the form of rabbits, doves, butterflies, toppled family photos, stopped clocks, malfunctioning radios and serendipitous encounters with the song \"La Vie en Rose.\" Greer offers some practical tips on communicating with the dead to enable readers to bypass mediums and seances; candles and meditation exercises help, but a simple blurted entreaty (\"Hi, Mom...Please let me know you're here\") often does the trick. She takes a stab at rationalizing everything by reference to relativity, quantum physics, thermodynamics and paranormal research, but grieving survivors may be happy to take it all on faith.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Taibo begins more than a decade before the massacre, when the movement was inchoate and the \"invisible enemy\" was purely an intellectual concern. He evokes relationships, passions and arguments lovingly. (Relevant section titles include \"Of Women and Mattresses,\" \"And Sometimes We Believe in the Informative Value of Tremors Running Through the Atmosphere\" and \"In Which the Virtues of the National Anthem Are Rediscovered.\") The Cuban revolution and the Vietnamese resistance galvanized democratic idealists across Mexico, and The Movement turned to action: widespread propaganda dispersion, silent demonstrations, flash rallies, community organizing and the 123-day strikes in high schools and universities across the country. Then, as the impact of the student revolt in Paris in May 1968 reverberated throughout the world and governments became increasingly reactive, 200 protesting students were murdered in Tlatelolco Square by government military police, and hundreds more were arrested and jailed. In the days and weeks following, the corpses of the slain students disappeared, the facts were contorted by government-controlled media, and reality turned to myth. Today, over 35 years later, much of the truth remains uncovered, but Taibo’s memoir goes a long way toward setting the record straight.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Carrère admits he is chronically attracted to tales of madness, due largely to deeply suppressed feelings of shame surrounding the family relationship to Carrère™s grandfather, a brilliant but gloomy Russian-speaking Georgian émigré to France who gravitated toward the German occupiers during WWII out of frustration and disgruntlement. He worked as an \"interpreter\" for the Nazis in Bordeaux, then vanished at the time of Liberation. Denial of his grandfather™s deeds had gnawed at him all his life, and by venturing to Kotelnich, Russia, with a film crew, ostensibly to produce a documentary of the plight of this long-lost Hungarian mental patient, Carrère plunged back into his mother™s first language, Russian, hoping somehow to gain insight into his grandfather. Hand-in-hand in this torturous Russian saga is Carrère™s romantic crisis with fiancée Sophie, a young woman in love with the author but so cowed by his moods and self-absorption that she took another lover and lied outrageously about it, compounding Carrère™s emotional paranoia. Despite a puerile erotic \"short story\" to Sophie that appears midway, Carrère™s solipsistic work proves absorbing, while his rendering of the hard-worn Russian inhabitants of Kotelnich are frankly moving.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bianca becomes involved after her friend Sarah's security-guard boyfriend is implicated in the crimes. However, the mystery takes a backseat to the drama and angst of teenage relationships. Bianca is an extremely likable character: smart, funny, and able to find humor in the worst situations. The author does a great job of capturing her voice, conveying all of Bianca's insecurities and doubts as well as her triumphs. Although the second in a series, the novel can stand alone, but readers will undoubtedly want to check outUncovering Sadie's Secrets(Bancroft, 2003) to fill in the gaps.

Unfortunately, it is generally not the case. Where there is a gap in the knowledge, Data Protection: A Practical Guide to UK and EU Law steps in to fill the void.  And does it admirably well!...What is surprising about the book is how easy it is to read.  I can only commend Carey's approach: it allows both lawyers and non-lawyers to become familiar with the issues and principles...This is an excellent text which is exactly what it says it is: a practical guide to UK and EU data protection law.  I recommend this to both lawyers who want a better understanding and non-lawyers who want a better understanding.`Peter Carey is not afraid to deal with the complexity of real life scenarios...Another excellent section is that on employment-related data...Marketing is also dealt with in a very useful manner...His section on privacy and websites is also extremely useful...Carey makes his book easy to understand without requiring his non-EU based readers to do any additional research...Carey also has a gift for knowing what information is required at what time...this book was a rare academic pleasure to read.' CTLR`Review from previous edition The book is a useful handbook of UK data protection law, and would be of particular use to those with no or little experience of this aspect of law.  It clearly sets out all the relevant law, and discusses the statutory provisions. It is concisely and practically written and includes useful examples of situations which arise in practice. ... ideal for many of the businesses who need to come to grips with data protection law as a matter of compliance.  It is written in an easy to follow manner with sufficient cross-referencing and details of sources of further information for the intelligent non-lawyer to obtain a basic understanding of data protection law.'

In the second half of the book, though, Anderson slowly emerges from the muck of self-pity. He has a companion who genuinely loves him, and before long he begins to love himself. The final story, 'Transfer Cookies,' ends...on a sweet note. The sense of relief as Anderson comes to terms with himself and with God makes the tension of the earlier stories worth it. And if that isn't the pinnacle of Mormon literature, I don't know what is: Without knowing misery, Elder Anderson wouldn't know joy. And so Elder Anderson fell, that Elder Anderson might be, and Elder Anderson is, that he might have joy.\" -- Ben Christensen, A Motley Vision", "related": ["B00DTZXFLY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He came into a personal relationship with Jesus as his Savior in his teen years under the ministry of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and studied art and archeology at the University of Edinburgh before answering a call from God to the Christian ministry. He then studied theology at Dunoon College. From 1906-1910 he conducted an itinerant Bible-teaching ministry in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In 1910, Chambers married Gertrude Hobbs. They had one daughter, Kathleen. In 1911 he founded and became principal of the Bible Training College in Clapham, London, where he lectured until the school was closed in 1915 because of World War I. In October 1915 he sailed for Zeitoun, Egypt (near Cairo), where he ministered to troops from Australia and New Zealand as a YMCA chaplain. He died there November 15, 1917, following surgery for a ruptured appendix. Although Oswald Chambers wrote only one book, Baffled to Fight Better (since updated and titled Our Ultimate Refuge), more than thirty titles bear his name. Mrs. Chambers, a court stenographer, compiled the rest of her husband's published works from her verbatim shorthand notes. For half a century following her husband's death she labored to give his words to the world. My Utmost For His Highest, his best-known work, has been continuously in print in the United States since 1935 and remains in the top ten titles of the religious book bestseller list with millions of copies in print. It has become a Christian classic. The Oswald Chambers material is published and licensed exclusively by Discovery House Publishers through arrangement with the Oswald Chambers Publications Association, Ltd.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Women must stop blaming others—men, doctors, the patriarchy, their mothers, their own hormones—for the way their lives are turning out, self-described feminist Maushart concludes, because freedom has its price. And if what women want next are marriages that are mathematically equal, that won't be easily achieved if women seek taller, wealthier, older men of higher social status. Women want to reintegrate motherhood into the rest of their lives, and those who choose to be stay-at-home moms are no less a feminist success story than their career-oriented sisters. Furthermore, women's ambivalence about gender roles is responsible for such failed feminist agendas as equal pay for equal work. This Australian import by a long-time American expat is an unfocused, pedestrian retread of very familiar territory that's saddled with Aussie expressions and examples that don't always apply in the U.S., and with blanket assumptions (e.g., referring to women who change their names after marriage: I've got news for you, girls. If you let him stamp his name on you, he is boss).Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sure to offend both Palin supporters and those who enjoy poetry, this assemblage falls somewhere between absurdity, mockery, and comedic entertainment.

I was teaching school in Michigan. I wanted to travel the USA. While talking to another women teacher, we realized we both had adventurous spirits and wanted to travel rather than teach. We decided truck driving would be the best way to do this. We could travel the whole country and be payed for doing the job. We quit teaching school and drove to Los Angeles to attend truck driving school. On our first driving job, I was awakened to the fact that this school hadn't come close to preparing me for what was ahead in my life. I learned trucking as I worked. It was frightening, fun, intimidating, humorous, and I couldn't wait to see what was coming next. It was difficult for me to connect to the way the world viewed me as a truck driver, as apposed to the way they had viewed me as a teacher. I was the same person, but wasn't treated the same as when I was a teacher. I soon became adapted to my new role in life and enjoyed it more than I thought I would.", "related": [], "rank": 2795921, "title": "Eastbounders eBook", "author": "Jill Shearer", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Felix Deakin, mobster extraordinaire, is so unwilling to serve out his full term in Lancashire Prison that he tells his lawyer and the crown prosecutor Naomi Dale that he'd be glad to testify against a rival gangster in court. Thrilled, they agree, but their plans go belly up when the wily Deakin, even more unwilling than they thought, escapes en route from court. DS Henry Christie, newly reunited with his wife but still up for a quick tumble with Naomi, is assigned the job of finding Deakin. Genteel readers may not care for all the torture and corpses Christie encounters in his quest, but they nicely echo the torture and corpses surrounding ex-cop Steve Flynn, now captaining fishing tours in the Canary Islands and, as Deakin sees it, living high off the million English pounds Flynn confiscated from him in a drug raid. Flynn is forced to deal with the murder of his girlfriend and the explosion of his boat. But what sends him back to England to confront Deakin is the villain's abduction of his son, for whose release he demands the million pounds. When Flynn offers his help in finding Deakin, Christie reluctantly consents. The result is an unexpected twist and a sizzling wrap-up. Oldham (The Nothing Job, 2009, etc.) stands beside Bill James as another tough, undervalued practitioner of police procedurals, none more astounding than this.  --Kirkus Reviews, 15th April 2010", "related": ["B0078XFXMW"], "rank": 1746791, "title": "Seizure (A Henry Christie Mystery Book 14)", "author": "Nick Oldham", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of which is great fun, but what's point? Well, this epistolary diatribe aims to take the \"Dear Liberal Elites\" to task primarily for two reasons: their inexcusable fair-weather support of Barack Obama and their willingness to tout high-minded liberal ideals with public rhetoric while pursuing an utterly corporate agenda with their actions. Again, don't mistake Siegel for a venomous conservative. By his own admission, he supports single-payer health care, an equitable tax code, gay marriage, gun control, and other popular lefty causes. But as always, any ideal's most poignant criticisms come from its adherents. As such,Harvard Is Burningshould find fans among both Republican readers and those for whom the Democratic Party hasn't supported a true liberal since LBJ, at least. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B005Y27VLU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story of how young Jessica, burdened with a permanent leg brace and consequent loneliness, finds her Christmas wish granted when she hopes for a monster, \"a friendly little one to play with,\" moves nimbly via both the words of veteran author Wilson (All the Rage, Forecasts, Sept. 24, etc.) and the more than 30 pages of full-color paintings by Clark, a World Fantasy Award winner. The titular thingy shows up under Jessica's bedroom weeks before Christmas; the complication is that, as the family's housekeeper says, \"Like a rose must bloom and a pig must squeal, a cow must moo and a thingy must steal\"Aspecifically, Jessica's Christmas presents on Christmas Eve, taking them back to Thingyland. Before it can do so, though, Jessica gives it a present, the first it's ever hadAleading to an inspired solution to its natural kleptomania. Wilson's story is pleasant and cheerful, but never grips the emotions as some other Christmas tales do (say, Peef: The Christmas Bear). More impressive are Clark's deep-hued, often kinetic paintings, which depict the thingy as a kind of smiling, tentacled mushroom. This isn't an instant Christmas classic, but it's a good bet for those who like their Christmas cheer spiked with a hint of SF and spookiness.

As a lifelong acrophobic, it is a trade I could have never followed myself. I get a bit queasy when called upon to ascend even fully-completed high buildings. The thought of having to tightrope-walk narrow, bare girders two hundred feet above the ground literally scares the hell out of me. But it's a job that has to be done and I certainly respect guys who have the nerve to do it. My friend, James Lewis is such a guy. He also happens to be a fine writer. His first novel Witch Lightning bears witness to this fact.\n\nThe book combines a number of other elements along with the ironworking sequences. It is in part a love story between the protagonist, Joe, and his girlfriend, Sarah. It is also a fantasy involving a strange female recluse who lives alone in a remote forest cabin and is purported to possess supernatural powers. James generously credits me for suggesting he include this element as I did in my own novel The Judas Hills. It involved a group of loggers who unwisely attempt to harvest the timber in a remote valley rumoured to have been cursed by a malevolent shaman. Mixing genres can be very effective as in Lewis' gripping tale.\n\nOne of the novel's big strengths is the salty dialogue. Whether on the job or in the pubs, the characters speak convincingly in the colourful argot of the workplace and the streets.\n\nJames Lewis is definitely a comer. He is presently at work on a second novel. If it is as gripping as Witch Lightning I certainly look forward to reading it.\n\n\n--Peter Trower, Award Winning Author", "related": [], "rank": 3795918, "title": "Witch Lightning", "author": "James L.

Having a father who was a Chinese martial artist as well as a judo wrestler, Yasushi Abe naturally grew interest in the world of martial arts.   Prior to engaging in karate, he was interested in judo and boxing. Training began in his high school days. During high school, he figured boxing will be useful in fights and learned to fight on his own. During college, he entered Kaneko Gym, a professional gym taught by an east asian champion.  He was on the judo team, but,was scouted by the weightlifting team because of his superior lower body strength. He participated in two high school competitions. He has won the championship in competitions including regular adult competitors as well. He competed in the lightest weight class, the fly-weight (under 52 kg), and was the tallest competitor in high school.  There was an episode in which there were two brawls during his high school days. Seven opponents versus himself.   In both cases, he defeated the opponents’ leader within one minute.  After graduating from Nihon University with a degree in Physical Education in 1982, he worked as a physical education teacher in Tokyo. In 1983, he started learning Shito Ryu style karate. He won a kumite tournament in Musashimurayama City and joined their kumite team.  He won 8 consecutive times at the All Japan Teacher competition, surpassing the “King of Kata,” Sakumoto sensei’s record.  He was awarded the Renshi license by the Japan Karatedo Federation. This certification is only given to select certified All Japan referees that have achieved over 5th level (godan).  In addition, the Renshi license is only awarded to a chosen few individuals.  Abe sensei has been active as the vice referee for the all Japan High School Karatedo for Tokyo City. Through interactions with all the high school karate instructors across Japan, he researched traditional kata and martial art styles. His profound knowledge of karate can be said to have stemmed from here. He taught karate to five of his children who all became Tokyo City champions. His family was able to enjoy the only male championship trophy and the only female championship trophy at the same time.", "related": [], "rank": 1406778, "title": "Perfect Learning Karate Kata For Athletes", "author": "Yasushi Abe", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He read Physics and Astrophysics followed by another degree in Digital Systems while trying to be an astronaut, but unfortunately there was no astronaut program in the UK. His favourite story is split between Lord of the Rings, Nine Princes in Amber and Thomas Covenant. He really cannot decide between them. KDL is still waiting to be an astronaut, and several careers later, somewhere in the darkness a story took form, a tiny piece of the truth, an echo that grabbed him by the throat. He started to write what he knew to be a six part series. In it he wanted to offer a highly conceptual image of an imperfect world and universe, while trying to make sense of it through a connection to life. The initial story is for YA, but each subsequent one is going to mature and age with the protagonists. The first novel was self-published late 2005, The Changeling. The story is about a boy, Peter Badger, who goes in search of his missing father in a land where he can become his namesake, but that is just the start of his problems. In this new world, where everything undergoes a dark transformation after the sun goes down, where your enemy has even greater powers than knowledge, where demons are trapped by their broken sources, he encounters Michelle Hawk and Paul Otter, the kind of friends who he would strangle while they are trying to save him. The second in the series, The Eternal Well, is a very dramatic rescue of a soul that could destroy the whole of existence. In this, our Changelings are asked to enter the Realm of the Dead. Released in kindle format December 2011. Currently, KDL is working on the third in the Changeling Saga. The whole series is exploring materialism against spirituality, human nature against the animal spirit, demon against mortal, while wrapping it all into a high octane fantasy adventure.", "related": [], "rank": 4137024, "title": "The Eternal Well (The Changeling Saga Book 2) eBook", "author": "K D Lathar", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A strong collection, the stories complement each other, evoking many aspects of an era in which being “all right” meant “married.” The young women here chafe at and rebel against this concept or muddle through it while gaining a newfound understanding of their options and potential. The most compelling tales feature girls masquerading as men to achieve what they could not as women, in either their personal or professional lives. Others employ magic and fey as a way to break free from a proscribed future. The complex period language is used to uneven effect across the collection; in some pieces, an overly mannered style allows a slow simmer; while in others, the prose struggles to engage the reader. Most of the authors, however, do let their voices shine through to create compelling narratives. Older teens and adults looking for historical romance in short form will enjoy this look at love and independence in the age of restraint.

She's written numerous published articles, essays and shorts, and is active in the Northern California chapter of Sisters in Crime. She has a deep passion for all things feline, and for many years has worked with her beloved tigers, leopards, jaguars and other exotic cats at an exotic feline conservation center. Another love is the sea; she adores living by the beach, surfing, strolling the strand and beachcombing. Her many friends know she can always be tempted by bad movies or good wine, preferably combined. When she is not hard at work writing or preparing for the coming zombie apocalypse, she can be found doting on her cats or swordfighting with her Irish lover.", "related": ["B00H91HUD8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now here I am 60 years later, still telling wild stories. Actually my work is pretty predictable, always clean stories fit for family times with a weird, twisty, happy ending. Sometimes I make Youtube videos to go with the stories. What I imagine they'd look like as movies. Oh, I love it! So, you can type in the titles of my books there and see for yourself! I'm trying to post some here for you also, but life gets so busy, and time gets away it seems. I am on Facebook also. Please, come by and visit! facebook.com/pages/Peggy-Lee-Johnson-Author/110733699000412?fref=tsI have lots of videos on Youtube, book trailers and of course silly cat things! I haven't figured out how to update my blog on Amazon but..oh well! If you enjoy action, adventure, time travel, Pirates, aliens or westerns, there's a bit here for everyone! My recent story was a dare; could I write a story without aliens, ghosts or scifi? It was great fun and is now part of a series of Anne Bonny, and her lady pirate adventures! Life itself is such an adventure! Come play with me. Explore my stories. Let's pretend.

His career as a solicitor ended swiftly when he left Liverpool for London, with a half-finished manuscript under his arm and only forty pounds in his pocket. His first book to attract attention was the largely autobiographicalThis Is the Schoolroom.During World War II he joined the Royal Navy, and his war experiences provided the framework for the novelHMS Marlborough Will Enter Harbour, which is one of his best-known books, along withThe Cruel Sea. The latter was made into a classic film starring Jack Hawkins. Established as a top name writer, his career concluded withThe Master Mariner, a historical novel of epic proportions, the final part of which was both finished (using his notes) and published posthumously. Well known for his concise storytelling and tense narrative on a wide range of subjects, he became one of the most successful novelists of the twentieth century, whose rich and varied collection bears the hallmarks of a truly gifted writer.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Suffering the emotional fallout of her recent abortion, Kate is blinded to Cam's pain. When he surprises her with tickets for a Caribbean cruise, Kate refuses to join him, preferring to stay behind and work the Calgary summer festival. With Cam away, Kate soon drowns her sorrows in a \"harmless\" flirtation with Doug, a festival security guard. But with a serial killer stalking the city, Kate can't fully concentrate on either Doug or Cam--especially after a festival volunteer, Jeff, starts threatening her. Then a young boy disappears from the festival grounds, and a security guard is murdered. Kate is convinced Jeff is behind the crimes and vows to nail him before he kills again. Filled with nerve-tingling suspense, Nicholson's latest offers plenty of action, memorable characters, and a cliff-hanger ending that guarantees readers will be hankering for the next installment in this always-satisfying series.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

Miller, Jr. had worked for more than forty years in the fields of computers and telecommunications at several major corporations and universities. However, he always had a desire to write, so armed with a new computer in 1991 he sat down and began writing his first novel, Pima. Over the years John has continued writing as a sideline. Because he had lived in southern Arizona for a total of nearly ten years, first while serving in the U.S. Army in the mid-1960s and later while working for a Government contractor and then a private corporation, John decided to set his Pima series of novels in an area he knew well, the mountains and deserts of Arizona. Later short stories and novels are set in other locales. Now John makes his home in eastern Pennsylvania, the area where he grew up.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His journey inadvertently ends up setting him on a collision course with a mighty warlock hellbent on revenge. With the help of new-found friends, and previously untapped powers, Kalin must find a way to defeat Myriad, the last living universal.Mona Hanna has created one of the most lovingly crafted young adult fantasy novels I have ever read. The degree of attention to detail is extraordinary. From start to finish, there are no gaps in narration, no lack of coherence and no significant deviations from the storyline. Each chapter is an example of how to write a fast-paced yet concise scene. The quality of her prose is so fluid that each scene melds with the next. Her characters are multi-faceted individuals, humans, albeit powerful, who are working through their own individual angst. I found myself rooting for Kalin, empathizing with his struggle to find his place in a world that rejects his talents. And reading about his relationship with Regina brought me back to that bursting emotion felt when one first falls in love. The conflicts, the twists and the ending may seem a bit traditional but Miss Hanna's writing manages to captivate from beginning to end. Reading the novel made me feel like a young child again, sitting around the campfire, mesmerized by an expert storyteller's talent for making words a reality. Given the strength of this first book, I expect great things from the rest of the novellas in Mona Hanna's Prentor series.", "related": ["B00I2E5EQG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.625, "rating_total": 29.0}

Instead of the stage, God called Herbert to the pulpit, where as a pastor, Bible teacher, and author of more than fifty books, he touched the hearts and lives of millions of people.Dr. Lockyer held pastorates in Scotland and England for twenty–five years. As pastor of Leeds Road Baptist Church in Bradford, England, he became a leader in the Keswick Higher Life Movement, which emphasized the significance of living in the fullness of the Holy Spirit. This led to an invitation to speak at the Moody Bible Institute's fiftieth anniversary in 1936. His warm reception at that event led to his ministry in the United States. He received honorary degrees from both the Northwestern Evangelical Seminary and the International Academy in London.In 1955, he returned to England, where he lived for many years. He then returned to the United States, where he spent the final years of his life in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with his son, the Rev.

He has been reading books and telling stories as long as he can remember. This book series grew out of his storytelling to his children about Indian culture and history, especially the stories that move him and make his heart beat faster. When not writing, he has fun juggling his roles as a husband, father and a Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist. Aninda Dutta, the Illustrator, is a graduate of California State University School of Engineering. He had formal art training as a child, but most of it is self taught. This is his first illustrated book series and he looks forward to doing many more. He lives in California with his wife and two children. This is the second book in the Adventures Through the Door series. They are for ages 8 and above. They are fiction, yet their roots are in real events. Early reviews for Adventures Through the Door series: ”Well written and historically accurate. Excellent way for all children to begin to understand the culture and history of India. This book is about India but the potential is great for the “magical door” to open minds to a variety of historical eras and cultures.  Reading this book aloud or assigning it to children, would allow teachers to take kids on exciting adventures to other countries and time periods.” - Jo Ellen Priest Misakian, Library Media Program Director, Fresno Pacific University Past President, California School Library Association Director, Region VII, American Association of School  Librarians “I truly believe that a good book stirs your emotions, and it did just that! It left me with a smile on my lips and tears in my eyes! The book incorporates values of culture, patriotism and curiosity.” - Bindia P., Mother and Middle School Teacher, California “India’s rich history revealed to its sons and daughters born and living in a foreign land. A must read.” –Marion Bowman, UK  “What a personal experience! We didn’t want to put the book down. I highly recommend it if you want your children and yourself to feel connected to India.” - P.M., Father Georgia “Excellent plot. The themes of hope, kindness, bravery and pride in culture – all have place in today’s culture. The characters are true-to-life, children can identify easily.” - R.R., Principal, Middle School, California http://www.adventuresthroughthedoor.com", "related": [], "rank": 4188572, "title": "The Poet of the World Arrives (Adventures Through the Door Book 2)", "author": "Harjot Singh", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Belvore, Virginia, much sooner than expected. His mother, who was told to lie down and wait and then left alone, wandered the halls telling anyone who would listen that it was time! She was right. It was 1 a.m. Darren grew up with his parents, two brothers, and sister in Rocky River, Ohio, on the shores of Lake Erie. In 1982, he graduated from college with a B.A. in cultural anthropology.  In 1986, he obtained a law degree, passed the Oregon State Bar Exam, and currently works as an administrative law judge in Portland, Oregon. He lives with his wife Dana, two dogs, a cat, and occasionally five great children who, not long ago, were all teenagers together.  When Darren was 26, he wrote his first novel while trying to start a legal career. Between receiving more than 200 rejection letters from various law firms and government agencies, he managed to type that book seven times on an old manual typewriter, which still sits on his office bookshelf today. Since then, he has written three more science fiction novels - on the computer. Raykens Cone is his first published novel. He is now editing his other novels for publication and working on a screenplay. When he's not writing, Darren likes to play basketball, hike, travel, cook, read, eat chocolate, and watch movies. He'd be the first to admit it's a pretty good life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His creator, Professor Vernon, puts Kele in charge of an important data-collecting mission onboard the inventor's prototype turbojet. Things take a turn, however, when the turbojet's flight path brings Kele directly overhead a nuclear research facility, which just happens to be gearing up for an important experiment. Kele soon finds himself dropped into a world he was never prepared for: our own.  Protected by his advanced defense systems, he lands unharmed on a golf course, right in the middle of a foursome's current game.  The humans' surprise upon meeting the robot quickly becomes curiosity when Kele attempts to put his gifts to good use and play a perfect round of golf.'The Perfect Round,' by Will Silver Hastings, is a meditation on the unlikelihood of perfection in our human world. This beautifully illustrated children's book contains over a hundred original digital drawings from artist Courtland Shakespeare that lend significant depth to the accompanying story. Bright colors and humorous expressions abound here - plenty to satisfy any budding young reader - but don't let that distract you from the serious thought at the heart of this book. Children will of course want to know where Kele comes from, and why he decides to try his hand at golf.  Why would a robot want to play a human game?  What's the fun of winning when you aren't able to lose?  These are questions that arise in 'The Perfect Round' but are never clearly answered.  If you're looking for a contemplative and entertaining story to read with your kids, then this is the book for you. - Red City Review", "related": [], "rank": 4984230, "title": "The Perfect Round", "author": "Will Silver Hastings", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It deals with high finance and corporate intrigue with exceptional insight. It is fast paced and very, very well written. It is brilliant—lucid and intellectually insightful, and of its kind, it is in the first rank.”—David Adams Richards (2000 Giller Prize)“For those who love a good thriller, full of twists and turns, intrigue, murder, money, and deceit all thrown at you at breakneck speed, this is one fantastic read! The attention to detail without bogging down the story gives just the right touch of realism. The author has done his due diligence in bringing together characters with backgrounds that make their present situation and their race to a solution through a maze of murder and mayhem totally plausible and believable. And the final twist at the end?—perfect.”—Shelfari“I enjoyed this book, it kept my attention throughout, the twists weren't always foreseeable and the reveal at the end wasskillfullydone. Definitely worth reading, and worth looking for more from James Piper.”—Rose Cimarron“Ranks in my top 10 for this year.”—Brian Mcpherson.“Read it to the end and you will be surprised who is the mastermind behind the transfer of funds and who hired assassins.

Remarkably, the implications of this framework are manifold and far-reaching, such as motivating a robust argument for the importance of basic science research in an era that emphasizes the translational, as well as an incisive take down of the insidious consequences of mind-brain dualism on the care of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. I recommend this enriching and provocative book broadly.\"--Bradley L Schlaggar, A Ernest and Jane G Stein Professor of Developmental Neurology, Washington University in St. Louis\" Problems were well sorted out and evaluated in a lucid way. It became obvious that Bunge is an experienced writer and that he has an important and readable message. He takes a very clear critical position on various forms of alternative medicine.\"-- Erling Norrby, Professor of Virology, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\"This is in my opinion an unusual and much-needed book. It is unusual because medicine is seldom a topic which, medical ethics apart, philosophers have touched at all. And it is much needed because the larger and more comprehensive contextualization that philosophers (should) bring to any topic is lamentably absent from present-day discussions of medical issues ... Bunge brings to his treatment of the subject a familiarity with a vast range of the relevant literature regarding medical issues and his extensive expertise as a philosopher, and as a philosopher of science, this enables him to offer uniquely valuable insight and information to his discussions. His book is a clear and cogent treatment of fundamental issues. I enthusiastically recommend the publication of this brightly instructive book.\"--Nicholas Rescher, Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy, University of Pittsburgh\"This book by Professor Bunge fills a much needed gap in the philosophy of medicine. With his brilliant and creative blend of ontological systemic materialism, epistemological realism, science based technology, and humanist ethics, Professor Bunge deals innovatively with the philosophical underpinnings of modern medicine. Be prepared to learn about the merits and limitations of Evidence-Based Medicine, Hill's criteria, empiricist pharmacology, the Frequentism vs. Bayesianism dilemma in RCTs, causality in therapeutics, biologism and sociologism in epidemiology, preventive public health policy, individual and social medical ethics, and the role of medicine in our culture, among other important problems.

She loves Stephan King and Emily Bronte, and something of their shadowy presence can be felt in much of her work.Hip and complex, Ocean's characters are often drawn from her show business background in southern California, and her lush descriptions of settings worldwide emerge from her extensive travels.Since she has diverse interests, Ocean as an author and recording artist, loves to explore myths, history, anthropology and psychology.An afficianado of horror and of thriller suspense and crime mystery genres, Ocean's books investigate the subconscious impulses of her characters, the primal factors that cause havoc in lives and in societies.Vivid characters, fast-paced plots and mysteries abound in her revelations of otherwise closed California culture, including the surf scene and the showbiz realms of wealth and privilage, as otherworldliness intertwines in her enthralling  storylines.Ocean, well-known as a singer and songwriter, also loves to write stories, articles, and poetry, ranging from suspense thrillers and fantasy to informative, helpful non-fiction and historical biographies.Ocean is a surfer and a vegan, and her writing reflects her familiarly with world cultures. Her background in show business also brings a fresh viewpoint and a vitality to her books.

Dr. David Freeman owns one of these beads—a present from a dying patient—but the tiny artifact seems to be more of a curse than a gift. Cheri Hassan, a steely, sexy assassin, tracks Freeman to Memphis, intent on getting her hands on the bead. Freeman and his girlfriend, Pam Blanchard, flee to London with U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents Patrick Dartson and Adnan Fazeph, where they hope an elderly war hero can shed light on the beads’ history. It turns out that many people are willing to kill for these strange items, which have a back story that goes back to the dawn of Christianity. Hassan in hot pursuit, and the foursome must also contend with a corrupt Scotland Yard official, Raoul Livingston, and a gang of violent Rastafarians. This high-stakes thriller is a true page-turner, although readers who haven’t read the series’ first installment may have some trouble getting up to speed. That said, the author’s lively prose and edge-of-your-seat action sequences will draw readers in and keep them engaged; the beads’ history is particularly compelling, if somewhat convoluted. A dramatic final showdown in an old English manor house ties up many loose ends but leaves enough details unresolved to allow a sequel. The novel does make a few missteps, however; for example, the author gives Livingston and Fazeph a score to settle, unrelated to the beads, that seems to be an awkward attempt to breathe life into the latter character. Readers may also find the idea of Rastafarian terrorists committed to “total destruction of the infidels” hard to swallow. Nonetheless, many will eagerly await the series’ next volume, which promises to reveal even more about the beads’ history and their power.A well-executed mix of Indiana Jones–style adventure and political thriller.", "related": [], "rank": 614434, "title": "Baden-Powell's Beads : London: Book Two : Beads Series", "author": "Paul Parsons", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was nominated for an Arthur Ellis Award for best first crime novel and had people who take blood thinners very worried.  Cathy's second thriller, Some Reason in Madness, was published in 2004.      Critics have claimed that Cathy \"writes a slick, straightforward tale\" with a \"sinuous plot as here stories gallop to a climax.\"  Writing mentor Eric Wright says, \"Vasas-Brown seems to have been born knowing how ... she's her to stay.\"  The Victoria Times-Colonist writes: \"Vasas-Brown hits all the right notes.\"  Though Cathy has been described as a writer who \"shows a talent for great gore,\" she has a very soft spot for animals (and she like people, too).  Cathy spends quality time with her two cats, Spike and Arthur, and she misses the company of the four felines no longer with her: Sherlock, Watson, Moriarty and Holmes.      When not writing, she enjoys traveling, skiing, in-line skating, playing cards, cooking and going to concerts.  She has been known to dance as if no one is watching.  Cathy credits her late father with giving her a love of music and puzzles.  Her late mother blessed her with an appreciation for nature and the gift of storytelling.  Cathy's husband, Al, gets an A-plus for simply being the best partner on life-s exciting journey. www.cathyvasasbrown.com www.facebook.com/cathyvasasbrown", "related": ["B00J3DCEWC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was born in Cuba in the 1960s to an Ashkenazi mother and a Sephardic father; after the revolution, the family went to Israel; then, after a year, they left for New York. Her father resists her extended education and never speaks to her after she marries a non-Jew. The history behind her personal journey will grab readers as she travels back to Cuba, to Israel, to Poland, and also back to Spain, where Jews were driven out in 1492 and where now communication on the Internet brings descendants together in a reunion in the city of Bejar. All those intrigued by their ancestral story will be moved by the personal quest and also by how—with the help of computers as well as the kindness of strangers—the lost can find their way home. --Hazel Rochman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Primarily a collection of columns previously published in School Library Monthly, it also includes updates, summaries, questions to ask, and extensive lists of additional resources. Few school librarians will read this book without questioning their own policies and practices. Do we too often bar students from checking out materials because of overdues? Are our check-out limits too low? Are students restricted by computerized reading programs or required to borrow books from a restricted reading level? Do we adequately protect student privacy? Do shrinking library budgets impede intellectual freedom? These are thorny issues, and many readers will scramble to update their collection-development and privacy policies after reading these thoughtful essays. Of course, the dreaded book challenge gets lengthy consideration-along with ways to prepare for challenges in advance-but issues like internet filters, confidentiality of library records, serving special-needs students and English Language Learners, and the role of the solo librarian serving multiple schools are also addressed. As a result of the many court cases, organizations, documents, and acronyms mentioned, some of the columns are on the dry side. The book comes alive, however, when the author describes actual sticky situations and quotes school librarians coping with real intellectual freedom and privacy issues. School librarians will want to have it on hand for the resources and guidelines it contains, but its real value is in the questions it prompts readers to ask about their own libraries.—Miranda Doyle, Lake Oswego School District, OR", "related": [], "rank": 2127379, "title": "Protecting Intellectual Freedom and Privacy in Your School Library (SLM Hot Topics)", "author": "Helen Adams", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At just two and a half hours, the journey is short but sweet as Laurie captures the essence of Jerome's touching tale. With his classic witty tone, Laurie dives headfirst into each character, offering his own take on each colorful personality.

Daniel\nZurenski is a self-proclaimed loser with no wife or kids and who has\nlived in his mother's basement for 40 years. He tries to get out of his\nrut by beginning to jog and attempt to run in a marathon, in order to\ngrant his mother's wish of him getting in shape. Along the way, he comes\n across some very interesting people, including Fred Zimmerman, who\nmistakenly causes an unbelievable but entertaining chain of events that\nwill affect many people. As race day arrives and the story unfolds, we\nwitness how the characters and incidents hilariously intertwine.From the very first sentence of Preston Randall's The Unbelievable Story\n of How I Met Your Mother, I was already laughing out loud. Not only did\n it keep me laughing throughout, but it also kept me guessing. Every\ntime I thought I had it figured out, something else would happen. Each\nsupporting character and side story were amusing in their own way, and\nwhen they finally all come together on the day of the race, you won't\nsee it coming. There is even a little bit of heart when you see what the\n story is truly about. The only issue I had with the story was the\njumping back and forth in the timeline, which got a little confusing for\n me. Overall, I was thoroughly entertained, and I will continue to keep\nmy eye open for this fantastic author.", "related": [], "rank": 44438, "title": "The Unbelievable Story of How I Met Your Mother", "author": "Preston Randall", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.5714, "rating_total": 32.0}

Twenty artists were invited to submit a work of art, then twenty writers were given one of those works to peruse and write one page about. The art I was given to peruse was a lovely set of earthenware pottery consisting of a bowl and plate that seemed to me to have a Native American feel and that were decorated with a snake and a bird. So I decided to write a Creation-type story told in the Native American style.

A\ngentleman on a motorcycle pulled out from a blind driveway in front of a large\ntruck. He didn't make it. I have a very vivid imagination, but I'm sure that\nnot even what I imagined was as bad as reality.In an instant we can lose our lives, our best friends, or a\nfamily member. Loss is something that hits home with everyone, and sometimes\nguilt can tear a person apart. Even the best of us have our moments where we\nmake a bad decision and something drastic is derived from it. Yet we have to\npick ourselves up and move on from that event, and that is the point I wanted\nto get across in this book.

During his school years, Silvano became an avid reader and writer for the sole purpose of mastering the English language. Although his writing generally received a favorable reception, he did not take his talents seriously, so he gave away many of his stories to friends or simply threw them away. Not being able to jump into a field of work relating to the entertainment business, coupled with having to make several hard choices in his life, he refocused his career. With the advent of computers becoming a common household item and a new technology era happening during that time, the choice between a career path and his artistic nature became a logical affair, and Information Technology became his new passion while writing was set aside as a hobby. However, after almost two decades of daydreaming and enjoying the emergence of new mediums of entertainment and publishing, Silvano has reopened the doors to his imagination planning to expose the world to the crazy universes living inside his head. Currently, he resides in Katy, Texas with his wife and two children. And yes, they think he is crazy too.", "related": ["B00FY551YG"], "rank": 4053447, "title": "The CW Chronicles", "author": "Silvano Williams", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How did the story writing unfold for you as compared to book one,Silent Harmony? Was your process different? Did you have any trouble spots or any scenes you were really excited to write?The difference for me in writingDark Harmonyis that I already had a good grasp on the characters and where I wanted Vivvie’s story to go. I felt as if I really knew these young adults and could get inside their head easier and have a good grasp on each individual story arc, especially Vivvie.My writing process is almost always the same. The first book in the series does take me a little bit longer than the other books because I do a lot of pre-planning and creating.  I write out character interviews, create personal journals for the characters, scrapbook my vision of what they look like, where they might live, etc. It’s a lot of fun. With each subsequent book in the series, I do plot outlines and refer back to the “Scrapbook” and all of the information that I had stored in it when beginning the series.The difficult parts for me in writing this book concerned the timeline. I originally wrote adult cozy mysteries. Those types of mysteries tend to take place over a short period of time (as in a week or two). When I write Vivvie’s story, I have to take in consideration that she’s away at school building relationships—not only with other people but the horses as well. For me, to write a full scope mystery in this series, I need to span several months, and I have found that difficult. Fortunately, I have a wonderful editor who helped me through that issue. There is also a real heaviness around some of the topics I was writing about in book two that—emotionally—as a writer I needed to handle but to also be in tune with in order to convey them in the best possible way I can.My favorite scenes to write are those with Vivvie and Harmony. I am very lucky to have several of my own equine partners and the connection I have with each of them is special and unique. I find myself getting emotional in a good way when I write the scenes with Vivvie and her horse.You are very involved in the world of equestrian riding in “real” life. How does the equestrian world compare to the world that you create on paper?The real difference is that in the world of eventing, riders don’t tend to be consumed with wealth and status as much as I portray the young adults do in this series. Event riders and horse people in general are down to earth and consumed with their animals and sport.Tell us about Vivvie’s unique ability–she’s special, but she’s in a contemporary, “normal” setting. What was the inspiration for her ability and how does that have an affect on the real world characteristics of the story?I was inspired to write Vivvie’s story after an equine telepath visited with my daughter’s pony, Mister Monty. Monty was always kind of aloof and although he did his job, he never seemed terribly connected to any of us. The telepath told us to place our arms around him and just send him love. He had apparently conveyed to to the telepath that he was used to always being sold off whenever a kid was done with him. That he would get attached and then be sold, and that he was afraid to become attached to my daughter or me. In that moment, I promised Monty that he would have a home for life and I meant it. I kid you not, from that day forward, Monty has been the most affectionate, sweetest, loving horse I have had. He nickers when we come to the barn; he’s always happy to see us. He changed that day and it inspired me to write a story about a character with that kind of gift. That was seven years ago, and I can’t tell you how many people have offered to buy the pony for a lot of money (a lot more than we ever paid for him), but he will never be sold. And although my daughter now has a much larger, more advanced horse, I am the lucky one who rides Monty now—as I am not terribly tall and he isn’t a small pony. It’s worked out well for both of us.What’s your favorite strength of Vivvie’s and which of her weaknesses drives you crazy?My favorite strength in Vivvie is her compassion. The weakness that drives me crazy is her fear of stepping outside of the box and trusting people a little more. She tends to be a bit jaded.  It’s because she doesn’t trust people very much, so I get that.Vivvie has a modest background compared to her peers at the Fairmont Riding Academy. How does that impact her story–is it important?It impacts her story because she gets to see the world from other perspectives. She gets to see that just because someone has money doesn’t mean they’re happy or are jerks. She’s a bit of a fish out of water which helps her discover who she wants to be and how she wants to be behaving in the world.Tell us about Vivienne’s journey from here on out.Vivienne has a journey ahead of her when she spends her summer at Liberty Farms in Virginia working with some of the more well-respected coaches in the world. I don’t want to give away too much but I can say that there will be more secrets that are uncovered, new bonds formed, and some old ones broken. Vivvie’s life changes quite a bit coming up and I hope the readers will continue to join me for the ride!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He loses a lot in this story, but he stays strong. He understands the value of friends and family, and when he understands his love for Vera, he embraces it wholeheartedly. The secondary characters have interesting, distinct personalities and are integral to the story. There's a rich world here that I love to spend time in.

His effort, however, is everything a suspense novel should be--a highly credible, tautly paced stunner. A young Japanese couple is found floating in the Hudson River in a VW bug, their bodies neatly sliced in half. FBI special agent Cuthbert Gibbons is called out of retirement to assist his frazzled ex-partner, Mike Tozzi, who's on probation. The trail leads to a Japanese slave ring that imports menial workers, run by the Mafia in cahoots with the Yakuza. Bruno teams a frustrated New Jersey Mafia capo with a Yakuza thug, each eager for career advancement and seething under a domineering, elderly boss. Other characters include a samurai who hacks cockroaches for target practice and two supportive girlfriends who keep the FBI men on track. The author does not romanticize his mafiosi, nor does he stereotype the honor-bound Yakuza. Developing complex characters whose rat-a-tat dialogue flashes, he leavens the suspense with dark humor and builds to a slam-bang finale.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1104843, "title": "Bad Blood: A Gibbons and Tozzi Novel (Book 2)", "author": "Anthony Bruno", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We have an ingrained habit of seeking rapport from beautiful women when we should be breaking it. Having a game plan for the former is paramount to success, where as the latter need to start learning to increase their value in order to get her investing; without that investment the conversation dies out.When putting this material together I chose not to favour any one style, instead I left it open to interpretation as to which would be best for the reader, as no to men are the same and I wanted this book to reflect that.Hopefully between the break down, starting with approaching and going all the way through to qualification, coupled with the ability for guys to e-mail me questions, many readers will see an improvement when they next walk up to their dream girl.", "related": ["B00A6YP1RC"], "rank": 1557522, "title": "A Pick Up Artist's Guide To Approaching: How To Meet Women: Any Time, Any Place (PUA Book 2)", "author": "Jack Davies", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
