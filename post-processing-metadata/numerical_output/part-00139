L. Doctorow wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Generally considered to be London's greatest achievement, The Call of the Wild brought him international acclaim when it was published in 1903. His story of the dog Buck, who learns to survive in the bleak Yukon wilderness, is viewed by many as his symbolic autobiography. \"No other popular writer of his time did any better writing than you will find in The Call of the Wild,\" said H. L. Mencken. \"Here, indeed, are all the elements of sound fiction.\"        White Fang (1906), which London conceived as a \"complete antithesis and companion piece to The Call of the Wild,\" is the tale of an abused wolf-dog tamed by exposure to civilization. Also included in this volume is \"To Build a Fire,\" a marvelously desolate short story set in the Klondike, but containing all the elements of a classic Greek tragedy.        \"The quintessential Jack London is in the on-rushing compulsive-ness of his northern stories,\" noted James Dickey. \"Few men have more convincingly examined the connection between the creative powers of the individual writer and the unconscious drive to breed and to survive, found in the natural world. . . . London is in and committed to his creations to a degree very nearly unparalleled in the composition of fiction.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She found a space and parked the rental Mustang—red, of course.Please have him be okay.Resting her forehead on the steering wheel, she allowed herself a moment of weakness. What would she do if he died? The world without Jimmy Tanner was too scary to contemplate, even though he'd let her down all those years ago. Somehow, she'd always felt the world would continue to rotate on its axis as long as her daddy was in the engine-building shop. Maybe because that meant there was still a chance for things to turn out right.Jamie straightened, reaching for her Detroit Pistons ball cap as she flipped down the vanity mirror on the visor. She smoothed her hair into a ponytail and twisted an elastic band to hold it, then pulled the tail through the back of her cap. She settled the brim low on her forehead. There. No one would remember her as a Poultry Princess now. And her mom wouldn't think she'd succeeded in molding her only daughter into a proper Southern lady.She pressed the lock tab for the Mustang and hurried to the double doors. Raising her chin, she prepared for what was to come. A burly guy did a double take as she walked by then let out a low whistle.Jamie ignored him. Glancing down, she realized her scoop neck T-shirt fit more snugly than she realized. Her clothes were normally chosen with care, sure to deflect rather than draw attention.Jamie shrugged. Nothing to be done about it now. When she reached the information desk, the volunteer seemed familiar.\"Why, Jamie Lynn Tanner, I haven't seen you in ages. Not since the Poultry Princess pageant .\"Jamie managed a smile.  \"I'm here to see my father. Is my mother already with him?\"\"Yes, dear. The waiting room is on the second floor, to the right. Tom's upstairs, too .\"\"Of course. Thank you, Mrs. White.\" Luckily, she'd remembered the woman's name.\"Certainly, dear. Your mother will be so pleased you're home. I'm sure she'll have you back wearing a dress in no time,\" she said, smiling.Jamie suppressed a groan. That's what she was afraid of.Choosing the stairs, she took them two at a time to make herself feel strong and in control. Because if there was one thing she felt around her family, it was out of control.TOM TANNER GLANCED up from his cup of machine- dispensed coffee and stiffened. His sister, ubermechanic extraordinaire and their father's favorite, strode across rubbed him the wrong way. He responded in kind.  \"Hi, Metal Mouth .\"Amusement lurked in her green eyes, so much like their mother's.  \"Thanks, Boy Wonder.\" It was a back- handed reference to his childhood obsession with superheroes.Tom slouched in his seat. Why did he feel like a gawky kid again? The answer stood before him in all her blonde perfection. Even in casual clothes and a ball cap, Jamie was clearly blessed with the good looks in the family. No wonder there hadn't been many left over for him.\"No problem, Your Highness,\" he said.His sister flushed. Score one for the kid brother.\"Stop it you two,\" their mother scolded.Shrugging off his irritation, he allowed himself to be the bigger person, as his mother had put it. His voice was husky when he said,  \"It's good to see you, Sis .\"And, surprisingly enough, itwasgood to have her back. He just didn't want her staying too long.Jamie smiled, showing off her excellent orthodontia. She leaned down and hugged him quickly.  \"Hey, Tom. It's good to see you, too .\"He swallowed hard. Losing his sister had been wrenching. But having her back could destroy every- thing he'd worked for.She straightened, addressing their mother.  \"How's Daddy doing?\"\"They already have him up and around if you can believe it. I thought it was too soon after a quadruple bypass, but they start rehabilitation right away .\"\"Probably for the best. You know Dad—he doesn't like to sit around much,\" Tom commented.His mother straightened.  \"He's going to be taking it a lot easier. Isn't he, Tom?\"Tom would have preferred to face a pack of angry stock car drivers than face his mom when she'd made a decision. He knew when to admit defeat. If only tem- porarily.  \"Yes, Ma'am .\"\"Jamie, the doctor should be done examining your father if you'd like to see him. We'll wait here. Your brother has a business proposition to discuss with you after that .\"\"Mom .\"Even he detected a whine in his voice. Here he was, a grown man and partner in a world-renowned performance engine business, and he was reduced to sniveling. He shot his sister a look.  \"Thomas Edward Tanner .\"That was all it took. Tom sighed.  \"Yes, Ma'am. Jamie, I'll talk to you over lunch .\"Jamie nodded, frowning.Tom watched her ponytail swing in time with her confident stride. He had the feeling Cyclone Jamie was about to unleash her damage and it would be his career that took the hit.JAMIE TIPTOED into her father's room. His eyes were closed and he was hooked up to all sorts of machines. She sat in the chair next to the bed, taking the opportu- nity to watch him, really noticing how much he'd aged in recent years.His hair was mostly gray and his face rounder, yet more lined. Her heart ached at the changes in him. And for the fact that she'd been away so much during the last twelve years.As if sensing her gaze, her father opened his eyes. \"Jamie,\" he murmured.She grasped his hand.  \"I'm here, Daddy .\"\"Yes, you are.\" He tried to smile, but it was a pale version of his usual cocky grin.\"You scared me .\"\"I scared myself. I'm glad you came. Your mother needs someone to lean on—I worry about her .\"\"Daddy, she's one of the strongest people I know. But I'll do what I can.You just concentrate on getting well .\"\"The old ticker's good as new. Maybe even better .\"\"You just had a quadruple bypass. That's serious stuff. I'm sure your doctor is going to expect you to make some lifestyle changes .\"He grimaced.  \"Yeah, a social worker's going to talk to us about that. And a nutritionist. Your mother's already talking about getting a bunch of heart-healthy cookbooks .\"\"Good for her. She'll keep you on the straight and narrow .\"\"You know it.\" He rubbed her hand with his thumb.\"It's good to see you, Kitten .\"Her throat constricted at his use of his old pet name. \"Yeah. Good to see you, too .\"I've missed you, Daddy.But she couldn't bring herself to say the words. Instead, she opted for a quick retreat to regroup.  \"I'm gonna let you rest. I'll be back later this afternoon .\"He nodded. His lack of protest bothered her. He was weaker than he would admit.JAMIE PUSHED the lettuce around with her fork. She eyed Tom. His appetite seemed unimpaired.\"How's your chicken fried steak?\" she asked.\"Excellent, as usual. The diner has the best food this side of Mom's table .\"\"Their salads could use some imagination .\"\"We have simple tastes here in Arkansas. You've gotten spoiled in the big city.\" His smirk told her he thought she'd always been treated specially.She decided not to rise to her brother's bait.  \"Hmm. We best not debate who's more spoiled or we could be here for days. Dad's concerned about Mom having our support. It won't help if we're at each other's throats all the time .\"Tom sighed.  \"Yeah. Mom's worried about Dad and Dad's worried about Mom. And we're stuck in the middle .\"\"We're their kids. That's where we're supposed to be. Besides, I think it's kind of cute .\"Tom snorted. \"I take it you don't have anyone special to worry over you like that? Things didn't work out with Tiffany or Brittany or whatever her name was?\" she asked.\"Nope. I'm married to my job. How about you?\"\"The same.\" Except that her job would be nonexis- tent in a couple of months. Who knew sales of domestic minivans could take such a hit?\"I thought things were going to work out with you and that engineer .\"\"I thought so, too.\" Her words were quiet, her hurt probably evident. It still stung to think she'd actually believed they'd had a shot at the white picket fence and two-point-five kids.Jamie shrugged to defuse her vulnerability.  \"He couldn't figure out why I need to spend so much time helping out at the racetrack when I design engines all day. It's an outlet that keeps me sane, allows me to be hands-on in a way I can't be at work .\"\"And his outlet?\"\"Getting hands-on with a sweet young thing from the accounting department .\"\"Ouch.\" Tom winced.\"It was almost a year ago. I'm over it .\"\"Sure. He didn't deserve you anyway .\"Jamie hoped she didn't detect a trace of pity in his voice. She sipped her sweet tea, stalling for time. Finally, she phrased a question that nagged at her.  \"How is it that our parents, who have such a strong marriage, could produce two children who can't seem to get re- lationships right?\"\"Hey, I didn't say I couldn't get it right. I just don't want to at the moment. My career's too important .\"\"Yeah, you're a horrible liar,Tommy. Always were .\" She was gratified to see the tips of his ears redden. They were back on solid, familiar ground.\"And you're a sanctimonious bi—\"She raised her hand, palm outward.  \"Ah-ah. You wouldn't want me to tell mom you're being uncoopera- tive, would you?\"He slouched in the booth, his glum expression so reminiscent of when he'd been a kid it almost tugged at her heart. Almost.\"D'you ever notice we both turn into ten-year-olds when we're together?\" she asked.\"You mean you're not that way all the time?\" His eyes sparkled with amusement.\"Let's make a real effort to act like adults.

We're living in strange times, and I want you to feel very comfortable.

Nye muses on what she learns on specific travels and shares stories about driving other people (among them, possibly senile strangers, distinguished visiting writers and her own son). Aside from some name-dropping and some mildly self-indulgent moments, Nye's prose flows fluidly and evokes any number of different settings.

This is an exemplary exercise in transnational history.\" -Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago, author of Provincializing Europe\"Astonishing in its range of research, Drawing the Global Colour Line shows convincingly that farflung expressions of white solidarity entered a definitive new stage in the early twentieth century as a result of consultations, conferences and concerted actions among political-economic and intellectual elites in the Anglo-American settler colonial world. Such interactions, captured in all of their telling human detail, expressed hubris but also bespoke panic at the prospect that white supremacy was slipping away. By reinterpreting race, this critically important study reorients our understanding of the whole story of the twentieth century.\" -David Roediger, Babcock Chair of History at University of Illinois, author of Working Towards Whiteness\"A work remarkable both for its international breadth and for its sensitivity to local 'particularity, is a model for the new transnational history. Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds expertly and imaginatively reconstruct how leading white intellectuals and politicians in turn of the century Australia, South Africa, the United States, and Great Britain fought demands for racial equality and jointly invented new doctrines of racial superiority to justify the maintenance and, in some cases, the reinvigoration of white privilege in every part of the world that Britain either controlled or in which it had once deposited its settlers.

DuBois's famous declaration that the problem of the twentieth century was the 'problem of the colour line'. By tracing the efforts by ruling elites in the United States, Australia, and other Anglo settler states in the early twentieth century to forge self-proclaimed 'white men's countries' by means of racial segregation and immigration restrictions, Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds demonstrate that their assertions of 'whiteness' were a transnational phenomenon, responding to the threats that migrant labor, colonial nationalism, and other forces seemed to pose to the established order. Their rich and compellingly written work provides us with a model of how to write history that transcends the nation, and it speaks to issues that remain relevant today.\" -Dane Kennedy, Elmer Louis Kayser Professor of History and International Affairs, Department of History, George Washington University\"This important book is a model of what world history could be...Highly recommended.\" -Choice\"In this magisterial study, Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds argue that far from being an expression of civilizational and/or racial confidence, \"the assertion of whiteness\" articulated by proponents of Anglo-American imperial dominance at the turn of the 20th century -- an assertion that served as the rationale for territorial expansion and global aspiration on both sides of the pond in the quarter of a century before and after the Treaty of Versailles - was, in fact, 'born in the apprehension of imminent loss' (2).\" -Antoinette Burton, International History Review\"this is a stunningly good book, written with a clarity and directness which is all too rare in contemporary academic prose.\" -Jonathan Hyslop,  Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research\"An exceptional study that could find a place even in the classroom, Drawing the Global Colour Line should command attention from historians, sociologists, and political scientists alike.\" -Thomas R. Metcalf, Journal of Interdisciplinary History\"This is an important book, for colonial and imperial historians, world historians, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Canadian, US, Chinese and Japanese historians, and for scholars of human rights. Simply listing this scope of readership indicates the vast scope of the book and the multiple terrains across which it ranges....  This book is exemplary in demonstrating how interconnected history writing can transcend the limitations of, and add explanatory power to, both nationally focused and traditionally comparative histories.\" -Alan Lester, American Historical Review\"Drawing the Global Colour Line is a landmark work of transnational history. In the book two outstanding Australian historians - Marilyn Lake, who has been a leading figure in the development of feminist history, and Henry Reynolds, who has been pre-eminent in exploring the grim history of the colonial destruction of the aboriginals - break new ground, both methodologically and substantively. They provide us with a truly global history of racial politics at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century.... Overall, this is a stunningly good book, written with a clarity and directness which is all too rare in contemporary academic prose.\" -Jonathan Hsylop, Journal of Global History\"a truly unparalleled form of transnational history, one which operates from the archives of white settler colonies (North America included), only to reveal the provincialism of that vantage point, most notably by taking seriously the challenges posed by a variety of 'Asian' actors - from Chinese migrants to Japanese imperialists to Gandhi himself. This is a once-in-a-generation book, a must-read for students of empire, international politics, critical race studies and global history.\" - Antoinette Burton, International History Review\"Drawing the Global Colour Line' forces us to reconceptualize the discursive and institutional development of  whiteness as simultaneously nationally grounded and globally mobile. Scholars striving to extend the study of the geographies of empire,   race, and whiteness, in particular, should find considerable inspiration in the approach marshaled so successfully herein.\" -Daniel Whittal, H-HistGeog\"This is a once-in-a-generation book, a must-read for students of empire, international politics, critical race studies, and global history.\" -Antoinette Burton, The International History Review\"Lake and Reynolds have truly accomplished a groundbreaking study of whiteness and immigrations policies from a transnational perspective.\" -Studies in English Literature", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While Woolf claimed that in her autobiographical To the Lighthouse she had \"done what psychoanalysts do for their patients,\" Dalsimer draws out the book's psychology and Woolf's relationship to her deceased parents, and shows the matter to be much more complicated. Dalsimer also demonstrates, through Woolf's later letters and essays, that her affectionate, influential and overbearing father and her self-sacrificing, distant and tragic mother were instrumental in forming her creative character. Woolf's mental illness (which ultimately led to suicide) also receives understated, careful consideration. Dalsimer's clinical objectivity may be more notable than her line-by-line literary criticism, but she elegantly explains how Woolf's imagination, often subsumed in tragedy, could still find pleasure in life's daily rhythms, and how writing \"consoled and sustained her as much as it was possible for her to be consoled or sustained.\"Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 3094821, "title": "Virginia Woolf", "author": "Katherine Dalsimer", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now that he's old enough to work as a deckhand, he hops a puddle jumper to a nearby town to pursue his dream of catching big kings on a commercial troller. He barely manages to secure a last-minute position before the short-lived, but storied summer salmon season begins, and he is initially very grateful to be the lone hand working under Tor, a moody and mysterious skipper who supplements his dwindling fishing income by selling antiques. His enthusiasm wanes when he learns that Tor is, in fact, pillaging the coastline of historical artifacts by systematically digging up a series of extremely valuable plaques left by early Russian explorers. Not only does Robbie question the captain's ethics, but he also begins to suspect that he may have learned a bit too much about the man's activities, and that Tor will not allow him to return home alive to betray his secret. All of the questions are sorted out in an exciting fashion by a sudden storm. Readers who appreciate straightforward outdoor fiction laced with bracing action and heady suspense will enjoy this book. They'll also learn a great deal about this rugged region, its history, and the present-day threats to Alaskan salmon fishing and the livelihoods of those who have depended upon it for generations.-Jeffrey Hastings, Highlander Way Middle School, Howell, MICopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The history of human displays conducted under the guise of anthropology and ethnography has been documented before, but never with such a keen sense of connection between these and zoo operations. Rothfels uses the experience of Carl Hagenbeck, a 19th-century animal dealer and a prominent force behind both zoos and human displays, to document the insidious links between the two enterprises: part of the sordid historical legacy that zoos have never confronted, much less expunged.(Chronicle of Higher Education)Rothfels... focuses on the 19th-century origins of modern zoos and the man who made it all happen. Carl Hagenbeck, a German animal dealer and zoo visionary, was the owner of the first zoo without bars, and he invented the use of a moated display and many other now-standard techniques. Savages and Beasts is a fine read, in which good use of picture archives has complemented the writer's extensive documentary research.(New Scientist)It is Nigel Rothfels' great service to show how Carl Hagenbeck's growing experience in mounting his ethnographic spectacles, and his observation of the public's reception of them, led to ideas culminating in a new kind of zoological park... Rothfels has written a genuinely important book for anyone interested in zoos, his perspective is new and convincing.(International Zoo News)Convincingly argues that the image of Hagenbeck as a modern-day Noah, a great animal lover trying to educate the public about the wonders of nature, belies the basic nature of Hagenbeck's enterprise. That enterprise had very little to do with love for animals, and everything to do with making money. More generally, Rothfels raises questions about past practices of exhibiting animals (and people) and about what zoos of the present are all about.(Journal of the History of Biology)Important, timely, and stimulating... A rich source on so much; Rothfel's account of Hagenbeck's consolidation of the animal trade, for instance, is exemplary, the mobilization of much research into a lucid exposition of overarching trends.(Anthrozoös)This is much more than a history of Hagenbeck's many successes. It is an historical explanation for why the environments of zoos today are meant to mask the human character of the places in which animals are forced to live their unnatural lives.(American Historical Review1900-01-00)The book is a good read and provides an interesting historical perspective... In short, this is an interesting book; it tells the story of [Carl] Hagenbeck, his peoples and animals from a slightly different perspective.(Animal Welfare2003-01-00)Rothfels's work elucidates how zoos offer a carefully scripted version of how human beings should understand animals.(Commonweal1900-01-00)A fascinating if disturbing tale of animal and human display.(German Studies Review1900-01-00)Savages and Beasts is an excellent book: Rothfels' arguments are subtle and well documented, and complemented by an excellent selection of photographs and illustrations.(Limina1900-01-00)A lucid, sophisticated, and nuanced account of the role that Carl Hagenbeck played in the history of the public exhibition of animals and people. Nigel Rothfels offers a complex but accessible account of the zoo as a cultural institution that has shaped our ideas about animals. The choice of illustrations is excellent and it should find a wide audience among historians, anthropologists, and general readers interested in the relationship between humans and animals.(Garry Marvin, University of Surrey Roehampton, author of Zoo Culture)", "related": [], "rank": 1561855, "title": "Savages and Beasts", "author": "Nigel Rothfels", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Along the way, he identifies the ways whereby a charitable arrangement can incrementally drift far from its original moorings; makes a vigorous case for the moral obligations inherent in a fiduciary relationship; and demonstrates that it is possible, but far from easy, to rectify a legal relationship gone wrong. The author does not shy away from arguing on behalf of his side; nonetheless, he readily and graciously acknowledges that the compromise which resolved this dispute made for good public policy-a position that has a refreshing ring given our current polarized society. Those who plan to give charitably, as well those whose responsibility it is to manage charitable gifts, should putTwilight at Conner Prairieat the top of their reading lists. (J. Michael Hittle, Professor Emeritus of History, Lawrence University)For anyone who has ever been associated with museums or not-for-profits,Twilight at Conner Prairieis a must-read case study, as well as a gripping emotional saga of the fight over Conner Prairie, an outdoor history museum and treasured community asset. Berkley Duck’s book, part memoir, part legal analysis, chronicles the spellbinding tale of one of the most astounding governance showdowns in the history of museums. Having lived through this period of upheaval in person, I can attest that Berkley’s account is scrupulously fair and accurate – unbelievable as it is. (Ellen M. Rosenthal, President and CEO, Conner Prairie)Twilight at Conner Prairieis a superb case study of competing visions for one of America's finest history museums. With the skills of a lawyer and historian and the first-hand knowledge of a participant, Berkley Duck shows how volunteer leadership battled to save a threatened cultural institution.(James H. Madison, Author of Eli Lilly: A Biography)Twilight at Conner Prairieby Berkley W. Duck III is a cautionary tale that will have wide appeal for anyone concerned with the survival of museums and historical sites as non-profit educational institutions.(Northwest Ohio History)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With a tone and style reminiscent of Elmore Leonard, the plot concerns Fred Carver, an ex-cop disabled by a hold-up man's bullet, who has turned to private investigating. When Edwina Talbott, a striking real-estate broker, asks Carver to investigate the suspected suicide of her lover, Willis Davis, Carver finds himself as interested in his client as he is in the case. Soon, Carver is stalked by a group of violent Cuban \"Marielitos,\" and it becomes apparent that the missing Davis is involved in something criminal. When a drug enforcement agent enters the picture, the signs point to drugs, but Lutz uses some neat twists to avoid the obvious.

Her books, and others in this genre, are about urban life, with a heavy dose of sex and crime. Many hip-hop novels are sold underground. (I bought one recently directly from an author, Brad Bathgate, who was selling his self-published paperback Pretty Ugly: A Harlem Situation on the subway in NYC.) Increasingly, these books are finding their way into bookstores. Vickie Stringer is now the CEO of Triple Crown Publications, which produces and promotes the work of other urban fiction writers. The publishing industry has taken note of this real market, and has started offering attractive book deals to some of her authors. So Stringer is now a literary agent as well. She was recently profiled by Cheryl Corley on NPR news - --Vickie Stringer is a leading figure in the hip-hop and urban fiction category.Nearly three decades on the NYC subways and it was the first time I ever saw somebody selling a book. I've seen pretty much everything else being hawked, sold or handed off over the years, and I've pretty much bought everything there is to buy on the subway... But this isn't a confessional. It's a book review, sort of. Yes, I bought a book. The F train had just crossed under the river and a fellow changed cars at East Broadway and came on selling books, one of which had his likeness on the front. By the time BLUE had change cars again at Delancey, I had purchased a signed copy of his book of poetry. I was about 20 pages in by 34th Street and burning though it. Like anything else you buy on the subway, from dope to bootleg Duracells, you never really know what you're going to get. You're taking a risk. Nothing bootleg about this volume of poetry though, and more like the Eveready Bunny than the phony copper tops, it keeps on going. BLUE was worth the risk. Mix journalism, philosophy, love, lust, NYC urban grime, southern comfort... that will bring you closer to what he's about. On top of that the guy can really turn a phrase. So in all, the best 10 bucks I ever dropped in the tunnels. - ---selling Books on the New York City Subway, John KremerHis Career is write on track New York Daily News.

Board of Education is the one of the most celebrated Supreme Court civil rights rulings, but the dry run against racial segregation began four years earlier, when Heman Marion Sweatt, an unassuming Houston mailman, emerged victorious in the struggle against the University of Texas Law School's admissions policies. Focusing on the lead-up to the Sweatt v. Painter case, and the case itself (which proves somewhat anticlimactic), Lavergne provides a penetrating, if occasionally dry, history of the carefully calibrated NAACP-led fight against intractable state officials at a time when there were no professional or graduate schools for blacks in most southern states; \"Heman Sweatt will never darken the doors of the University of Texas,\" remarked the Texas attorney general at the time. Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who led Sweatt's New York-based NAACP legal team, confronted not only white segregationists committed to the status quo, but also Texas blacks, who were split on the issue. Though Sweatt's victory is ultimately bittersweet (finally admitted to the law school, he later dropped out) Lavergne makes a powerful argument for the role Sweatt v. Painter played in ending segregation. Photos.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Founded in 1909, America has received dozens of awards for its coverage of religion, politics and the arts. In 2011 it was awarded Best Magazine in the General Excellence category by the Catholic Press Association. According to its mission statement, America is \"a media communications ministry that seeks to interpret the world for the church and the church for the world.\" From the beginning America has been the work of Jesuits from across the United States. John Wynne, S.J., the first editor, lasted only a few months, but the editorial formula he devised lasts to this day--editorial comment, short articles and reviews of arts and letters. America retains a loyal readership, especially among the hiererchy and other leaders and managers of the Catholic Church in the United States, lay and religious. During the post-Vatican II period, the editors have consistently promoted conciliar reform, but they have struck a balance between the extremes of liberal and conservative opinion in the reforming Church, acting as a bridge for Church dialogue. The balance favored by these editors has given the magazine a reputation for temperateness that its founding editor did not always share. But such steadiness has enabled the magazine to fulfill throughout the twentieth century the vision of its founder, who wrote in the first issue: \"The object, scope and character of this review are sufficiently indicated in its name--America: A Catholic Review of the Week.\" The Kindle Edition of America contains all articles found in the print edition plus occasional Web-only culture reviews.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate asThe New Centurions,The Friends of Eddie Coyle,The Godfather,Black Sunday, andThe Shiningall owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called \"police procedural\" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --Stephen KingWay back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series calledJoe Ryker, NYPD.I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, \"These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you'll know everything you need to know about police novels.\" After I read the first book--which I think wasLet's Hear It for the Deaf Man--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel,The Sniper, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, \"I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.\" Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --Nelson DeMilleTo read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit ourPerspectives on McBainpage.For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available for Kindle, visit ourEd McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 36.0}

I’m an avid reader of fantasy and count Tolkien, Irvine, Goodkind and Rowling amongst my favourites. I am also keen on Saxon/Viking re-enactment where I learned the brutal reality of fighting in a shield wall. I have cracked fingers and ribs on several occasions so it’s not for the faint hearted. :) Writing has become my main hobby and I am a self published author. This is not an easy route and I have come across many pitfalls along the way. I’ve written a fantasy trilogy The Prophecy of the Kings, which comprises Legacy of the Eldric, Dragon Rider and Shadow of the Demon - sample chapters and reviews can be found on this website.  This is the beauty of self publishing - I can show you my work to let you decide if it’s for you. I have just written Drachar’s Demons which I thoroughly enjoyed writing.  I believe my tales are good and they are getting some really excellent reviews. My books will definitely appeal to lovers of traditional fantasy. The plot is complicated, but the tale is described as easy to read. Some reviews want more in the way of character development, some reviews really like my characters. I like the reader to fill in the gaps and I enjoy hearing other people’s interpretations of my characters. Being self published, I rely on word of mouth, so if you enjoyed my books please, please spread the word - on Amazon, Facebook, Twitter or all of these!  My interest in fantasy started with Princess of Mars, The Lord of the Rings. And probably Dune next! Motivated by LOTR I put pen to paper, determined to create a story with bold characters and an intriguing plot. The book's initial scene was a betrayal set deep in the heart of a mountain. Encouraged by my friends, I started writing The Prophecy of the Kings in the months during my wife’s pregnancy with the first of my two terrific sons.  As with most aspiring authors, writing is part time, with the plots progressing in the evenings and holidays. At times the PotK tale seemed to naturally take the characters into extreme peril, and for months I was left wondering as to their fate. Refusing to rewrite the tale to rescue them I patiently waited before inspiration struck and the story continued at a fast pace to the next cliff-hanger. Suffice to say my sons have now grown up and, as the quill dries, are of an age to read and appreciate this work. As to the characters in my tale, they too have grown older and wiser; as to whether they survived the tale, only reading the novel will tell.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Flood, vice president of Academic Affairs. Flood, a man of questionable background, is focused solely on converting the current education process into a strictly online venture—a plan that is being met with extreme faculty resistance. Flood’s utopian digital environment would not only greatly reduce the need for human educators but also decrease the value of higher education as a whole by allowing for the purchase of a degree rather than the earning of one. Setting his sites on the elimination of Jane and the rest of the “useless” Liberal Arts department as his first order of business, Flood recruits the much despised Borensen by skipping all proper channels and making her department chair; allowing such an unstable woman to wield power over her colleagues should help to quickly weaken the ranks—or at the very least their resolve. Dadlez (Mirrors to One Another, 2009, etc.) clearly shows her range from a serious philosophy professor to a witty novelist, successfully rendering compelling characters who meld perfectly together to create a clever, farcical tale. Subtle allusions to classic literature are scattered like Easter eggs throughout; such as the evil, insect-eating dog named Reinfeld. Of note is Dadlez’s interesting habit of not so much introducing her characters but rather throwing them right into the mix. Although this works in most instances, there are moments when it feels like the reader missed something, and, within the context of the passage, failed to have the implied familiarity with a particular character who, in actuality, had only just been introduced.Though certain plot lines felt a little too drawn out and exhaustive, Dadlez succeeds in crafting an entertaining story by shining a humorous light on the backdoor politics and self-serving agendas in the world of academia", "related": [], "rank": 2127384, "title": "The Sleep of Reason", "author": "E.M.

The answer may surprise you. In the latest Kindle Single from TED books, two leading biologists argue that you can catch cancer--but what could they possibly be talking about? First, the facts: If you're a man, your chances of developing cancer in your lifetime are almost 1 in 2. For women, it's 1 in 3. This year, the United States will spend $125 billion on cancer treatments, making cancer costly in both dollars and lives. TED authors Paul and Holly Ewald want to change all that, and they want to do it through prevention. There is no doubt that cancer is caused by mutating cells, but the authors ask, what are the causes of those mutations? In some of the most deadly types of cancer--stomach, liver, cervical--communicable diseases are the primary causes. Reduce hepatitis B and C and you reduce liver cancer. Stop HPV and you stop cervical cancer. Rather than promoting chemotherapy, which they call \"a high stakes gamble\" (albeit a lucrative one), the authors call for a framework of knowledge to help us better understand the interplay between humans, cancer-causing diseases, and cancer. It could lead to a world where, rather than treating cancer, doctors can simply and cheaply prevent it. --Chris Scluep", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 1035991, "title": "Controlling Cancer: A Powerful Plan for Taking On the World's Most Daunting Disease (Kindle Single) (TED Books Book 10)", "author": "Holly Swain Ewald", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then I was\ndiagnosed with a \"frozen shoulder\" and told that it would take me up to two years to heal. I was devastated.\nThat's when I started doing theQigong posturethat Elizabeth taught me. In two\nweeks time I could move my hand, my shoulder already went into the next phase\naccording to the physiotherapist. My knee problems disappeared. I felt full of\nenergy and cheerful for the first time since my accident. I felt good in\nmy body. Oh, and there and then I was discharged - didn't have to go to any\nmore therapies!I highly recommend everybody to\nlearn Qigong as it WORKS\nWONDERS!\"Katalin\nBalogh, London", "related": ["B009JFKYGC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope you enjoy it, and if you do, please consider reading about Paul and Kathryn's progeny, Will Foster, in the 21st century thriller:The Calypso Directive(available on Amazon in hardback and Kindle editions).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 3.75, "rating_total": 45.0}

In 1896, he began working for the London publisher, Redway, and also T. Fisher Unwin as a reader where he remained until 1902. During this time he undertook his first freelance journalistic assignments writing art and literary reviews. He also contributed regular columns to two newspapers: the Speaker (along with his friend Hilaire Belloc) and the Daily News. Throughout his life he contibuted further articles to journals, particularly The Bookman and The Illustrated London News. His first two books were published; two poetry collections, in 1900. These were followed by collections of essays and in 1903 by his most substantial work to that point; a study of Robert Browning. Chesterton's first novel, 'The Napoleon of Notting Hill' was published in 1904. In this book he developed his political attitudes in which he attacked socialism, big business and technology and showed how they become the enemies of freedom and justice. These were themes which were to run throughout his other works. 'The Man who was Thursday' was published in 1908 and is perhaps the novel most difficult to understand, although it is also his most popular. 'The Ball and the Cross' followed in 1910 and 'Manalive' in 1912. Chesterton's best-known fictional character appears in the Father Brown stories, the first of the collection, 'The Innocence of Father Brown', being published in 1911. Brown is a modest Catholic priest who uses careful psychology to put himself in the place of the criminal in order to solve the crime. His output was prolific, with a great variety of books from brilliant studies of Dickens, Shaw, and RL Stevenson to literary criticism. He also produced more poetry and many volumes of political, social and religious essays. Tremendous zest and energy, with a mastery of paradox, puns, a robust humour and forthright devotion along with great intelligence characterise his entire output. In the years prior to 1914 his fame was at its height, being something of a celebrity and seen as a latter day Dr Johnson as he frequented the pubs and offices of Fleet Street. His huge figure was encased in a cloak and wide brimmed hat, with pockets full of papers and proofs. Chesterton came from a nominlly Anglican family and had been baptized into the Church of England. However, he had no particular Christian belief and was in fact agnostic for a time.

Their vision was to bring the hope of the gospel toWest Texas and to teach believers how to find God's specific path for their individual lives. Prior to beginning their own ministry in Amarillo, Scott and Missy worked for Kenneth Copeland Ministries for more than 20 years. Scott was the Director of Television from 1993-1999. As the television director, Scott did more than produce the Believer's Voice of Victory television programs and KCM's children's movies. He fulfilled one more important segment in the call of God on his life. Born and raised in the southwest, Scott was born again and filled with the Holy Spirit by the age of 6. Growing up as the son of a pastor, Scott faithfully used his talents for the Lord. By the age of 13, he was singing every time the church doors were open. When Scott was a teenager, he began to realize the call of God on his life. While attending a Kenneth Copeland Ministries meeting, God began to reveal to him what his life's journey would be in a life of ministry. In 1979, Scott attended Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During this time, God directed him to move to Fort Worth, Texas. In a few weeks, Scott was on staff at KCM, duplicating Brother Copeland's radio tapes. From singing at Believers' Conventions, to producing his own album, to overseeing the television department, Scott has continually sought God's will for his life, and obeyed the directives he heard. Scott and Missy married in 1984, and together they faithfully served the Copelands, knowing for years the day would come when they would step out into ministry together. On August 15, 1999, Scott and Missy celebrated their first service of BelieversWay Church, Amarillo, and by God's clear direction are showing the people the \"right path\" which is relationship with God. Ten years later, BelieversWay is a network of two churches - in Amarillo and Midland, Texas. Ten years later, over 1500 people have been saved and countless lives changed. It's all about building each generation to reach the next through the power of relationship.", "related": [], "rank": 3775852, "title": "What Seems Impossible: Living Every Day In The Power of Possibility", "author": "Scott Johnson", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She works at a bookstore and\nloves to read vampire novels. So when she gets an invitation to try out a\n new book club, she is in for a surprise to find out it is really a lure\n to invite humans willing give up their blood to feed vampires. These\nSanguines want to nourish but not hurt anyone. Devani is special because\n she has a rare blood type. Unbeknownst to her, she has been specially\nchosen by a man from her past, a man whose passion for Devani becomes\nhis obsession. As Devani draws closer to Roman, she must battle her own\nsense of right and wrong. But how can murder be justified? And with the\nMilitia watching, Devani has to be careful.\"Legacy\" by Melissa R. Smith is a well-written tale that takes a reader\ninto the dark world of the Sanguines. With its seductive atmosphere,\nthis book weaves romance and danger on every page. The bond between\nDevani and Roman is unique. I especially liked the compromise between\nthe conflicting worlds of human and vampire. Devani and Roman's need for\n one another is sweet and tender. Yet Devani holds fast to her moral\nambition even though her heart is pushed to the breaking point. I really\n enjoyed \"Legacy\". The pacing was perfect in this story. I am happy to\nknow that Roman and Devani's story will continue on to another book.\nGreat read!", "related": ["B00DOM12E4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His fine art paintings have been displayed in galleries located in Dallas, Ft. Worth and other Texas cities. As a teenaged guitarist he performed for five years with future Rock legend's Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs, but later, always intrigued with Earl Scruggs, he became a bluegrass banjoist. In 1998, with an ensemble of all-stars that included the multi-talented Miller, he released a critically acclaimed album, \"Collage\". Having already dabbled with creative writing in college, then penning free-lance advertising copy, and finally publishing song lyrics, he began to seriously write short stories in the late 90's. His first roughs of \"The Panhandle Murders\" were assembled in 2006. A constant backdrop for this mystery is the Texas panhandle environment. Haydon has travelled extensively through Palo Duro Canyon where he enjoys the peacefulness of the rough, but beautiful, terrain. Always with camera in hand, he prefers to do his art and writing to reflect these excursions into the Texas back-country. Though a big-city resident most of his life, he's been living in small towns for the past two decades. His feel for this slow-paced lifestyle is always evident in his writing. Mr. Haydon is currently busy producing a new novel, some short stories, and music-related magazine articles.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He left behind no story arcs, no further plot ideas or concepts of where to go next. He'd created a single novella and the concept for a series, but not a series itself.    A decade later, I was commissioned to expand the novella into a full-sized book and then create nine more books, thus turning Smith's idea into what became known as the \"Family d'Aloembert series.\" I'd read and enjoyed Smith's earlier Skylark and Lensman series, so I was eagerly anticipating this assignment.    Unfortunately, it was not all I'd hoed for. The novella certainly had action aplenty, but the writing, the universe and the characters left much to be desired. The text used bizarre words like \"ultratoilsomely.\" The characters were two-dimensional and way too goody-goody even for the 1960s, let alone the 70s or later. The history and development of the universe were painfully naive, with an anti-communhist screed straight out of the McCarthy era of the 50s. And while Smith was noted for the excellence of his villains, the ultimate bad guy here never once set foot onstage. Clearly this work needed a lot of rehabilitation.    Having to stick closely to Smith's creation hampered me considerably, but I did as much as I could to make the characters and universe more believable, and I tried to come up with stories that were exciting enough to please Smith's legion of fans. I got letters of praise that told me I was succeeding, which was most gratifying.    Still, as decades passed, the initially creaky concept grew more and more outdated. Finally, in the mid-2000s, I decided to update the series. I tossed out \"Imperial Stars\" in its entirety; instead, I wrote an entirely new first novel to introduce the universe and the characters, and I made major modifications to the remaining 9 books to fit the new beginning. The result is what I now call the Agents of ISIS series, something I feel is more appropriate for the 21st century.   Planet of Treacheryis book 7 of the classic series, superseded byTraitors' Worldof my Agents of ISIS. Whichever series you choose to read, I hope you enjoy it.--Stephen Goldin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I sort of tried to do this\nin 2012 but on most days only got about seven daily servings into my\ndiet.  This year I decided that big salads were the answer and this is\nwhere this book has been wonderful.This is one of several books\nthat I have to help me accomplish my 10 vegetables/fruits a day goal.\nThe book is organized well and the recipes are clear.  My one gripe is\nthat the recipes do not have calorie counts (I use my Weight Watchers\nonline tabulator to figure that out) but almost all of them only contain\n health y, wholesome, good for you ingredients.  I have given it five\nstars despite the calorie issue because the recipes are that good!Probably\n the best thing about this book, as opposed to other salad books that I\nhave is that most of the dressing ingredients only contain \"good\" fats.\n For those of you who have not spent too many nights, as I have, pouring\n over the good versus bad fat literature, the \"good\" fats are basically\nthose that come from olive oil, grape seed oil, avocado and nuts.  The\nSnow White Salad and the chicken, cashew and broccoli salads are worth\nthe price of the book.  I have got to admit that I am in a bit of a rut\nwith these two salads.  I want to make them and eat them every single\nday.  My spouse, alas, is ready to move on to the other great salads in\nthis book.  If you are looking for healthy and delicious salads, this\nbook will not disappoint.", "related": ["B00JO8YDW0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.7273, "rating_total": 52.0}

The design here is rudimentary; basic line drawings correspond to numbered instructions, each of which is a manageable two sentences or less. A couple of symbols appear throughout: a lightbulb, which offers additional helpful tips, and the warning triangle, which denotes safety issues (e.g., in the case of ironing). Although some of these may seem to fall under the category of common sense, like washing a car or getting a good night’s sleep, others, from fixing a flat to tying a bow tie, take some practice. It’s amazing how many little, useful skills there are to know; this is a good choice for teens heading off to college.

Though born and raised in the Midwest, Celeste has spent the better part of the past three decades in Texas. Celeste enjoyed writing and all kinds of creative endeavors growing up but when it came time to choose a major in college she followed the advice of those around her and chose to get a degree that gave her the best chance of getting a job. With both an undergrad and graduate degrees in business Celeste, much like her character Margaret MacRae in the Patrick’s Garden Series (www.patricksgardenseries.com), lived the next twenty years of her life pretty much from the Left Side of her Brain. It wasn’t until she was in her mid thirties, a corporate executive, a wife and mother of four daughters, that Celeste admitted to herself that something was missing. She tried journaling to get a handle on her feelings but found the process didn’t work for her. She edited herself too much. She was afraid that if she wrote how she was really feeling and someone read it, it would lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. That’s when she rediscovered telling writing. The first book Celeste wrote was a non-fiction called How To Follow Your Dreams: Before Your Life Becomes a Nightmare. She said she wrote the book during her ‘detox’ phase from working fulltime in her ‘left brain’. She had virtually lost touch with her creative spirit and had no idea what she wanted to do with her life. The book was more logical that fanciful. But it helped her figure out what she wanted to do. What her lost dreams were…and they included writing. From there she began writing an eleven book series called The Adventures of Andi O’Malley written at the third grade level. Looking back at the books Celeste is the first to admit the books are ‘too sweet’ and ‘too preachy’ for the kids today, but nonetheless they served their purpose. She sees that writing the books was a necessary part of her life progression and healing.

The Devil's Valet, McKellar's third thrilling, steamy novel introduces readers to a lovely set of likable California  twins. The author fleshes them out, and when the heroine, Crosby Campbell falls in love with an English film star, the tangled web of murder, seduction and intrigue springs from Manhattan to the Hamptons to London to Tokyo and California. The environments are intoxicating, the characters filled with power and passion. And, even though Crosby's handsome husband is villainous, McKellar makes him a truly tragic figure. She avoids what I like to call the cookie cutter character pitfall, which is refreshing. Even characters with few redeeming qualities are complex. Nothing is entirely black or white.Published by Philia Publishing, The Devil's Valet is a page-turner. How far would you go to get what you want? To get revenge? To find the love of your life? Who is Darby's father, and why did a Japanese billionaire kidnap her? If you want a fast, adventurous read featuring characters that will stay with you, then you will find McKellar's latest book the perfect escape. --Linda Lane, Las Vegas Woman Magazine", "related": ["B00EPFLJ6K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

G. A. Henty's children's novels typically revolved around a boy or young man living in troubled times. These ranged from the Punic War to more recent conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars or the American Civil War. Henty's heroes - which occasionally included young ladies - were uniformly intelligent, courageous, honest and resourceful with plenty of 'pluck' yet are also modest. These virtues have made Henty's novels popular today among many Christians and homeschoolers. G. A. Henty died in 1902 shortly before finishing his last novel, By Conduct and Courage (which was completed by his son).", "related": ["B001L1RU2I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hanson is a Maine based architectural historian who lives in a 19th century home, Whitten House, in the mid-coast region. He grew up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, before settling on the Maine coast. His most recent publication (and first eBook) is \"Cleaning Antique Staffordshire Transferware.\" Using documentary research into probate inventories of members of the original owners of his house, and shards of historic transferware found under and around the house in the course of restoration, he was able to identify the exact patterns that were in the house during the time two generations of the Whitten family called it home. Searching in shops, flea markets, auctions, and online, he has slowly found pieces of the patterns the Whitten family owned and assembled a collection reflecting their time in the house. After a decade of collecting, he has brought back to the house many items matching those owned by the Whittens in the 19th century. As part of that process, he developed an effective and affordable method for cleaning transferware, which he shares in the book.

That\n was more than 60 years ago. Since then I've worked as a freelance\nwriter, a magazine editor, a political speechwriter, an advertising\ncopywriter, a public relations writer and an association manager. I\nstarted writing novels after retirement. I write the Greg McKenzie\nmysteries featuring a retired Air Force OSI agent. The first, SECRET OF\nTHE SCROLL (2002), takes place in Nashville and Israel. The second,\nDESIGNED TO KILL (2004), is set around Pensacola, FL, and the third,\nDEADLY ILLUSIONS (2005), wanders about Nashville. The fourth, titled\nTHE MARATHON MURDERS (2008), involves the long-defunct Marathon Motor\nWorks in Nashville, and the fifth is A SPORTING MURDER (2010), dealing\nwith professional sports in Nashville. My second mystery series follows\nthe adventures of Nashville PI Sid Chance. The first book, titled THE\nSUREST POISON (2009), deals with a toxic chemical spill in a suburban\ncounty. Book 2, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE MURDEROUS (2011) features Medicare fraud, drugs, crooked cops and a ruthless hit man. My latest books are a Post Cold War Political Thriller trilogy, BEWARE THE JABBERWOCK (2012), THE POKSU CONSPIRACY (2012) and OVERTURE TO DISASTER (2013).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He then presents a deep textual analysis of each writer and describes how their ideas are different and even how their ideas progressed over time. Next, the book explores category theory and details how it has revolutionized the notion of the axiomatic method. It considers the question of identity/equality in mathematics as well as examines the received theories of mathematical structuralism. In the end,Rodinpresents a hypothetical New Axiomatic Method, which establishes closer relationships between mathematics and physics.Lawvere's axiomatization of topos theory and Voevodsky's axiomatization of higher homotopy theory exemplify a new way of axiomatic theory building, which goes beyond the classical Hilbert-style Axiomatic Method. The new notion of Axiomatic Method that emerges in categorical logic opens new possibilities for using this method in physics and other natural sciences.This volume offers readers a coherent look at the past, present and anticipated future of the Axiomatic Method.", "related": [], "rank": 933521, "title": "Axiomatic Method and Category Theory (Synthese Library Book 364)", "author": "Andrei Rodin", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I used information while doing my school book readings and came up with ideas for quizzes, hands-on projects, and writing tips for keen young writers. People often asked me about the story behind the sacred scarab, and who was the Scarab King? All is revealed in the Companion Guide, as well as the Riddle of the Sphinx, and much much more. A Glossary will help young readers with unfamiliar words, and also introduce readers to the magnificent and weighty background to the history of Ancient Egypt. It truly was a spectacular civilization. What I have included is just a very small portion. There is a recommended Reading Guide for anyone interested in discovering more about Ancient Egypt and its many famous people and monuments.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His extraordinary personality crystallized when he was a student in early Soviet Moscow, and his 19-year-old self became the lifelong touchstone of his poetry and his politics. A romantic Communist, Hikmet (1902–63) constituted a party of one, whose commitment to truth, freedom, equality, and justice led to 12 years of imprisonment in and 18 of years virtual exile from Turkey. He wrote prolifically, both hackwork under pseudonyms to support his immediate family (blacklisted while he was interred and exiled) and a body of lyric, dramatic, and narrative verse that was the bedrock of the new literary language created by founder of the Turkish republic, Kemal Atatürk, when he decreed that Turkish adopt the Latin alphabet, banish Arabic and Persian borrowings, and reflect ordinary Turks’ speech. This was a green light to Hikmet, who shared with poetic modernists worldwide the determination to be understood by the common person. Meanwhile, harassment, jail, and exile undermined his intimate relationships and ruined his health. In enlightening remarks on his work as much as the limning of his life, Blasing shows a great poet becoming a great hero.

In what may be the only general-audience book in English that coincides with the occasion, Sanders provides plot and musical synopses of a dozen operas and a musical synopsis of the Manzoni Requiem, all within a chronological précis of the composer’s life and the greater events, principally the Risorgimento, that affected him. To reach the broadest possible audience, Sanders eschews all written notation of the music and provides a four-page glossary of musical terms, access to which is signaled by printing the terms in boldface when they first appear in the text. Lacking all condescension, Sanders’ writing couldn’t be clearer, with the plot synopses relaying the who, what, and why, and the musical synopses discussing the how of each opera’s action (which necessarily entails more detailed exposition of the plot; hence, the musical synopses are longer).

He writes about the ancient middle east - Egypt, Canaan and Israel - and has also contributed to the lively academic debate about these times.  His first book, \"In a Milk and Honeyed Land\", explores events in the Egyptian province of Canaan at the end of the Bronze Age, around 1200BC. It follows the life, loves, and struggles of a priest in the small hill town of Kephrath. A second novel, \"Scenes from a Life\", follows on from and is set around twenty years later than \"In a Milk and Honeyed Land\".  The short story \"The Man in the Cistern\" is set in the same location in the years between the two novels. The short story \"The Lady of the Lions\" is set in the same location but around one hundred and fifty years earlier. \"Triumphal Accounts in Hebrew and Egyptian\" is the ebook version of his PhD thesis which, for those who want the technical details, supplies academic underpinning for some of the ideas and plot themes followed up in fiction. When not writing words or computer code, he enjoys spending time with family, walking, and wildlife, ideally combining all three pursuits in the English Lake District. He works professionally in IT quality assurance, and also develops mobile and tablet apps with a focus on the ancient world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I used Sandy's plan for a year. It did take some initial time to do but it was worth it. I was able to use tried and true family recipes with better planning strategies to create minimal leftovers/waste. No strange new foods except when we put them on the calendar. It made me plan leftovers into the calendar or as the start for another recipe with out feeling like we were eating the same meal all week. (We weren't - not by a long shot.) Laying it out long term like this also helped with planning the grocery shopping and stocking the pantry. I was better able to shop the sales for standard use items AND the our weekly needs without going over budget. I also like that the plan allows you the flexibility of opting out is you choose or something comes up. By having it written on a posted calendar, it helped me to remember things like defrost the meat the day before, and aided other family members to help with cooking so that it all didn't rely on me. I also put the recipe cards or cookbook page numbers on the fridge to encourage other to start cooking without me if I was late.\"~ Dina D.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To feed his ravenous muse, he began writing his first novel, Lowcountry Punch. Around that time, what started as a passion in wine became a neurosis.    After six years of the Wall Street thing, Boo decided it was time to end his sedentary, computer-driven lifestyle.  He grew out a handlebar mustache and moved clear across the country into a double-wide trailer situated on 5 acres of Malbec vines just down the road from Hedges Family Estate on Red Mountain in Washington State.  The Hedges family took him in and taught him the art of farming and the old world philosophies of wine.
