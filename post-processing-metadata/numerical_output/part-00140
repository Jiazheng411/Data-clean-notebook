This is a superb work, an excellent source book for psychiatrists wishing to locate their work within the much broader study of the mind. It might also form the basis of what could be an enormously creative dialogue between neurobiology and psychoanalysis.—British Journal of PsychiatryAllan Schore['s]...work is leading to an integrated evidence-based dynamic theory of human development that will engender a rapprochment between psychiatry and neural sciences.—American Journal of PsychiatrySchore's...model explicates in exemplary detail the precise mechanisms by which the infant brain might internalize and structuralize the affect-regulating functions of the mother, in circumscribed neural tissues, at specifiable points in its epigenetic history....I unreservedly recommend this uniquely informative book to psychoanalytic readers.—Journal of the American Psychoanalytic AssociationIn this extensively researched (over 2,300 references) and cogently argued text, Allen N. Schore provides a major contribution to the study of the relationship between the neurological processes and structures of the brain and the socioaffective and object representational phenomena that we generally associate with the mind. Schore's approach is an outstanding example of the genre of studies seeking to demonstrate neurological isomorphisms for the kind of mental or psychic states that have been postulated by psychoanalytic theory.—Psychoanalytic QuarterlyFor those who read this book, the study of human development will be entirely transformed....Not only is this book destined to be an authoritative reference for those who work with infants and children, but it also promises to radically restructure many of our current paradigms of infant/child development and care....it is perhaps the first comprehensive source to emotional development. Its scholarship is indeed impressive. Its integration and conclusions are insightful.—Contemporary EducationAllan Schore'sAffect Regulation and the Origin of the Selfis a brilliant, if not awesome, synthesis with supporting data from a spectrum of many disparate sources, including anatomic, developmental, neurochemical, and psychodynamic. He has developed a coherent and integrated neuropsychological model of the location, development, and mechanism of the self.—International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine...this is a superb integrative work, an excellent source book and required reading for any psychiatrists wishing to locate their work within the much broader study of mind.—The British Journal of PsychiatryIn this remarkable and unique integrative contribution on socioaffective ontogeny, Dr. Schore has assembled an incredible array of data that spans virtually the length and breadth of modern science, including neurobiology, developmental neurochemistry, behavioral neurology, evolutionary biology, sociobiology, developmental psychology, developmental psychoanalysis, and infant psychiatry. His aim in this work is to construct an interdisciplinary model for the attainment of optimum integration from all these disciplines so that we see a more transcendent picture of the emerging human infant as a neurobiological-social-emotionalself.I believe that he has achieved his aim and, in so doing, he has lifted our neurobiological 'hardware' into a unique costarring role with our mental (cognitive/affective) software and has highlighted how our neurons become key players in the formation of our personalities. We can almost now see brain and mind in a paradoxically discontinuously continuous Möbius strip connection....a pioneering work that holds considerable promise for everyone in the behavioral sciences. It fundamentally alters our traditional, fundamentalistic, cyclopean psychodynamic way of viewing infants and patients and dramatically informs a newer and much needed interdisciplinary perspective.—James S. Grotstein, M.D.University of California at Los Angeles Medical School, From the ForewordUnlike most scientists, Dr. Schore takes his inspiration from the interfaces between disciplines. In this book, he makes a heroic effort to link the worlds of the cell, the brain, behavior, and inferred emotional states through their common participation in regulatory processes at work within the early relationship of the child and its parents. He offers both original ideas and an exceptionally broad survey of recent research in all these areas.—Myron A. HoferCollege of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University...a remarkable feat of scholarship and a very important contribution to the neurobiology of emotional development. I like your pattern of reviewing and discussing the psychological and social side of development, followed usually by a chapter that looks at the neurobiology.

And then, on the night of February 18, 1952, in a raging blizzard off the coast of Cape Cod, Webber, now a young lifeboat coxswain with the U.S. Coast Guard, and his crew performed a miracle. Two big oil tankers had split in two in raging seas, and nothing—not a big cutter, not a sea plane, not a chopper—could reach them in time. Only Webber and his crew of three volunteers had a chance. He knew they would probably die on this mission. They were, after all, in an unassuming thirty-six-foot rescue boat that didn’t even have a name but for the “CG 36500” on its side. But he loved this boat—and he knew the inauspicious Coast Guard motto: “You have to go out. You don’t have to come back.” Webber took the CG 36500 out in sixty-foot waves and saved thirty lives. He and his men won the rarely bestowed Coast Guard Gold Medal for Valor and a place in history that shapes the Coast Guard culture to this day. Two Tankers Downtells their story, capturing the full drama of one of the most gripping sea rescue stories of all time.", "related": ["B0041D8ERI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An easy two-hour drive later he was cruising through the beautiful Hunter Valley, wedged snugly between the blue-hazed Brokenback Ranges, dominated by the native euca-lypts. He had an idea the word eucalypt came from the Greek for 'covered'. Maybe it had something to do with the way the buds covered themselves, as though seeking shade. There were over six hundred species of eucalypt at the last count— Australia's gift to the world. It was the fine drops of eucalyptus oil in the atmosphere that gave off that marvellous purplish-blue haze. That was how the beautiful Blue Mountains some forty miles west of Sydney got their name.To his mind, trees made the landscape. He loved them. He was first and last a man of the land. Sometimes he thought he and the land were one—pretty much the same primal feeling of the first Australians, the aboriginals who had managed the land for 40,000 maybe 60,000 years. The white man, with his need for progress now almost out of control, was doing great harm to nature. The planet was screaming out for urgent change.It was a brilliantly fine day, all blue and green and gold, and the unfolding landscape was like one of Hans Heysen's famous rural paintings that found their way on to calendars and postcards and the like. Miles of sun-drenched vineyards met his eyes, expanding to the horizon. Here and there he caught glimpses of glorious big rose bushes, bearing a profusion of flowers. He knew roses were grown in close proximity to the vines because their presence protected the vines from certain blights. Fruit and flower gave off a heady rich perfume and a riot of colour.The Hunter was Australia's oldest wine-growing region, probably the most visited, and it produced wonderful wines. In fact the Hunter was a Mecca for those who relished gourmet food washed down with plum-coloured Shiraz, golden Chardonnay, citrusy Semillon or classic Cabernet with its blackberry flavour; a superb wine to complement every type of cuisine. He wasn't behind the door with the vino, having sunk a bottle or two in his time, but he still had a taste for a good cold beer.Some parts of the landscape were reminding him of Italy: the imported eucalypts, the golden sun soaking into the fertile soil, the intoxicating aromas of fruit and flowers, the open grassy meadows filled with wild poppies, scarlet and yellow, their papery petals bobbing in the breeze. He was halfway to feeling good when for many years of his life he had been swept by restlessness. He had a dark side to him. Linc had come to accept that. Now he took his time, savouring the laid-back atmosphere of the valley. It held more than a hint of the wild bush he loved. Every country had its own landscape. The Outback was Australia's, but therealOutback was farther on—the Back O'Beyond.He slotted in another CD and drove along with it as he continued on to his destination. Wangaree Valley. Wangaree was the legendary stronghold of the mighty sheep barons and their descendants, in particular his old friend, Guy Radcliffe. He and Guy had been through school and university together, and Guy had been a role model for him in those days—a calm, steadying hand when he'd really needed one. He remembered Dr Mallory, the headmaster of their school, describing Guy as 'the perfect gentleman'. There was no getting away from it. Guywasimpressive. Linc, on the other hand, was kind of wild—especially since he and Chuck, his elder brother, had lost their mother to breast cancer a few years into their boarding school stint.It had torn his heart out. He still wasn't over the shattering blow. Never would be. He had been very close to his mother, even more so than Chuck. Their father had favoured Chuck. The moment he thought of his mother Linc's breath caught on a moan. In those last heartbreaking days she had become so wasted—parchment skin stretched tight over delicate bones, hardly a vestige of her beauty left to her. But even at the end she had been so incredibly loving, so selfless andbrave,thinking only of them, her two boys, and his heart broke all over again. Suffering seemed to happen to the best people. His mother had been the one who'd held the family together. He was going to miss her until the end of his days.Right now he had to make an effort to clamp down on his upsetting memories. No one seemed to realise it—he knew he projected the misleading super-confident image of a man right on top of things—but he was a pretty complicated guy, maybe even messed up. Only his mother had truly understood him. His father had been antagonistic even when Linc was a kid. He knew he had always asked too many questions—not trying to be the smart-ass his father had long since labelled him, he had actually wanted toknow.He'd always had an enquiring mind. But his father hadn't seen it that way. To him, being questioned about anything was rank insubordination. Ah, well! He wasn't the first and he wouldn't be the last not to get on with his dad. But that was all over.He was in the valley for the best of reasons. Guy had asked him to be one of the groomsmen at his wedding. Something he had kept from the family. He had wanted to tell Chuck, but Chuck could unwittingly be conned into admissions he would never have made on his own. The wedding was to be celebrated the coming Saturday. Guy was marrying a very special girl by the name of Alana Callaghan—'the most beautiful girl in the valley'—or so the legend went. Linc had been delighted to accept his friend's invitation. Besides it would give him the opportunity to view Briar's Ridge.Alana and her brother, Kieran, had inherited the sheep farm from their late father. Guy had told him it was a good buy, and Guy was the man in the know. Guy also knew Linc was anxious to strike out on his own. Briar's Ridge just might work.It would be a huge challenge, even so. He did have money of his own, plus a nice little nest egg he had inherited from his maternal grandad—God rest his gracious, loving soul. His father, Ben, as tight-fisted as they came, would have refused point-blank to lend him a stake.Givingwas out of the question. The only thing his father would have given was a few tips to Scrooge. Except where Cheryl was concerned. Linc felt a burning in his chest at the thought of Cheryl, who could have answered to the name Jezebel. Cheryl was another pressing reason he had to get away from Gilgarra. Cheryl, the third Mrs Ben Mastermann, had taken no time at all to fix her predatory china-blue eyes onhim,of all people. He had taken it as a tremendous insult—both to his father and him.Now nowhere was safe. A woman hell-bent on pursuing a man who in no way wanted her wasn't a pretty sight. He might have earned himself a bit of a reputation with the ladies, but he considered himself an honourable man. Hell, hewasan honourable man. His only option had been to approach his father and let him know of his ambition to strike out on his own. He wasn't about to tell him that day was at hand. Ben Mastermann had been known to wreck more than one property sale.'Your place is righthere!' his father, angry as a bull, had bellowed, veins like cords standing up in his neck. Ben Mastermann had been furious that his younger son was willing to abandon their family heritage, even though everyone in the district knew father and son were nearly always at loggerheads.What his fatherdidn'tknow, and Linc could never tell him, was the problem he was having freezing out Cheryl. Their mother had only been dead two years before their father had taken Valerie Horden, a socialite divorcee and a long-time acquaintances to wife. That hadn't lasted, although Val hadn't been a bad sort—kind to him and Chuck in an off-hand sort of way. Not that they'd seen much of her, what with school and university. The marriage was over after six years, with a ritual exchange of insults, laying blame, and a hefty settlement for Valerie. Nothing like marriage to bring out the best and worst in people. Val, a dedicated sportswoman, had plunged in, but had soon found herself way out of her depth with the demanding and autocratic Ben Mastermann.Then had come a long hiatus, but just when Linc and Chuck had thought they had good reason to believe their father had abandoned any search for another wife, without warning along came Cheryl—who hadseriouslybeen searching for a rich husband along with the meaning of life. That had been a little over two oppressive years ago, and even now Cheryl was only a few years older than Chuck, which put her in her early thirties. The two brothers had spotted her as a gold-digger on sight. Chuck had put on a tortured smile for his father's benefit—Chuck was such a good-natured guy, and he loathed confrontations—but Linc, who had adored his mother, had stood well back, realising there was going to be trouble. Big-time.Their father still believed Cheryl had fallen as madly in love with him as he had with her. He even joshed her about her 'chasing him'. That was something Linc and Chuck definitely believed. Not that their dad wasn't a fine-looking man, but he was in his late fifties to Cheryl's thirty-two or three, and of course there was the tiny fact their dad wasloaded.Some ladies appreciated that sort of thing. A rich older guy was infinitely better than a young guy who wasn't. There had even been talk of their having a baby. He'd wait forthatto happen. The luscious Cheryl was obsessed with her figure, and he'd bet the farm Cheryl had no intention of getting pregnant. She would even convince his dad it washisfault without saying a word. Wasn't that the way with older guys who had so much to prove?It was all kind of sad. Worse yet,dangerous.Linc wasn't a guy who frightened easily, but Cheryl had freaked him out when she had burst into his bedroom.'You can't go, Linc!'She had thrown herself headlong at him, clutching him around the buttocks, kneading his behind through his tight jeans with ...", "related": ["B00835W0V6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It includes elements of the Holocaust, the French Resistance, the invasion of Southern France, and the internment of Jewish people in Cyprus who were trying to reach Palestine after the war. The story is told in flashback by an American soldier who is searching for Helga and thinks he has found her in a convent in Antibes. He's in love with her. But does she love him? And will he find her? With a multitude of different English, French, German, and American characters I have tried to make them all distinctly different, and hopefully, believable. You will have to let me know if I got them right!I wanted to write a Sleepless in Seattle style of story with a difference, and I knew when I started A Fine Woman that I would have to get the feel right. The result is that the general background about the American invasion of Southern France and the British Mandate over Palestine and Israel are all based on real history. And although the failed assassination attempt on Hitler is well documented, the invasion of Southern France is often overlooked by movie moguls. Equally important as Operation Overload in Normandy only two months earlier, it was codenamed Operation Dragoon, and was an equally fraught sea-borne landing undertaken by the US Seventh Army. The British internment camps in Cyprus for Jews intercepted while attempting to reach Palestine are also little remembered today.A Fine Woman was originally published as an Amazon Short in three parts. I have updated the new Kindle version slightly, mainly as a result of reviews and suggestions I received for the Amazon Shorts version. So I do try and take on board any suggestions.I am very pleased with the result and I think the flashback style as Captain Taylor searches for Helga works well. But having said that, I don't think there is actually a railway line that connects Antibes with Juan-les-Pins, Mougins, Vallauris and Grasse! Or even if there is a Convent in Antibes. But in the 1940s you never know! And finally, A Fine Woman is purely a work of fiction and nothing more, so although some concentration camps did exist in Germany during the war, the camp near Helga's estate is also fictitious, and no connection to any particular camp is intended or implied.", "related": ["B00JOWF2GW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 22, "rating_average": 4.1364, "rating_total": 91.0}

RoeIt-s the late 1850s, and in a matter of days, eighteen year old Martha Maguire is torn from her pampered life, forced into an arranged marriage without explanation, and shoved onto a ship headed for America.Martha-s dream of marrying for love becomes a nightmare of being married off to a much older man who has three young children. Martha finds herself filled with many emotions and endless unanswered questions as she is torn from her upper class English home and forced to travel in severe conditions to unsettled Wyoming. Martha-s dreams continually become nightmares as the turmoil, struggles, and unimaginable new life experiences change her into a woman she never imagined she could be.Shirley A. Roe uses grand historical description to pull the reader back in time. The reader can enjoy the elegant comfort of upper crust English living as well as taste the dust kicked up by the wagon trains and feel all the backbreaking hardships as settlers travel across America to claim open land and create new lives.Author Shirley A. Roe is the author of A Call to Faith and Freedom and The Whittaker Family Reunion, the sequel to this book. She has won several awards for poetry.This novel reads easily and is as unpredictable as the ever-changing life and unknown challenges early settlers faced as they conquered a new land.A highly recommended read for those who love a great historical story that feels real.

Musekura, who lost family members in the protracted aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, has a naturally compelling story to share. He subsequently meets relatives of those who had slaughtered his relatives, and ultimately decides to seek their forgiveness for his anger toward them, who while they are relatives of murderers are also, Musekura says, \"brothers in Christ.\" Jones outlines a theologically grounded process for seeking forgiveness that involves truth telling, remembering, repenting, and committing to change. Repenting is a key step that acknowledges the need to be forgiven and the sovereignty and grace of God's judgment. Neither says this is easy, but practice as a community is necessary: \"Our choice is between forgiveness and nonexistence,\" Musekura writes.

Cookson's (The Year of the Virgins, Audio Reviews, LJ 7/94) story, set in the English countryside, follows the disastrous marriage of a young Englishman from its beginnings in the 1920s to a happy, if not traditional, conclusion in the 1940s. The young man, Joe Remington, and his new bride Elaine return to his family home near Felburn. Elly cannot understand why Joe treats the servants as if they are, well, human. When Elly becomes pregnant, much against her wishes, she insists that her sister Betty come to care for her and the household. Betty is as plain as Elly is pretty and as kind as Elly is cruel. Will the good woman, Betty, end up with the good man, Joe, when his wife, who we are none too sorry to see go, is conveniently removed from the picture? Elizabeth Henry gives a fine reading, providing each character with a distinct voice and personality. This isn't profound literature; the plot is somewhat contrived, and the characters don't have much depth, even if the story moves along quite well. Still, Cookson's fans will check this out, and others seeking a light listen will enjoy it, too.

At the beginning of the book, it turns out that she isn't a mundane, that she is a very powerful kind of magical critter and, when folks find this out, they become scared of her and want to kill her. There's a lot more to the book than that, but Darla and her apparent lack of magical ability was the idea the book unfolded around.Some writers can sit down and the story pours out of them on the first draft and they come back and tweak some things and clean up others and, a couple of drafts later, their book is done. Oh how I envy them! I'm a multiple drafts kind of gal, starting with a first draft that is little more than a rough outline. I think I went through nine drafts with Until Death.I enjoyed writing this book and I hope you will enjoy reading it.

The reader is confronted at once by insistent questions in a high voltage prologue, and to put the book down before they're all answered would simply feel wrong. As the pace and emotional temperature alternate throughout, so do the depictions of blunt, forceful events and times of deliberate contemplation. One can sense the affinities of a southern writer here, with all the finesse and refinement implied by that tradition. Adding gentle motion to inertia, sound to silent backdrops and reflection to aggression's aftermath, Ms. Galloway's literary style weaves trace elements of Harper Lee and James Agee into the fabric, just enough to preserve a poetic undercurrent without  endangering the story's sharpness or modern relevance. Ms. Galloway has an excellent instinct for avoiding the boundaries of excess. Her characters, situations and conversations are believable throughout, and always steer wide of self-consciousness or the improbable. </span><br><span></span><br><span>I read <em>The Corner Between My Life and Hers </i>slowly, and in one sitting. This was not due to schedule requirements. The book demanded it, and fellow readers might want to open the prologue knowing that they have free reading time ahead.

From a renowned expert in the field, this is a valuable resource for beginning and experienced therapists who work with child victims of interpersonal trauma, such as abuse and neglect.\"--Charles E. Schaefer, PhD, RPT-S, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), Fairleigh Dickinson University \"Gil and her contributing authors take us on an amazing journey that captures the creative ways traumatized children find to heal when we meet them in their world, not with language, but with play. The richly detailed cases are filled with unforgettable lessons about how to help children express their private, complex experiences. The book also provides substantial support for those needing to validate the healing power of creative interventions within a trauma-informed context. We will definitely recommend this book to the thousands of professionals the Institute trains yearly. It will be useful for both new and seasoned practitioners.\"--William Steele, PsyD, MSW, Director, National Institute for Trauma and Loss in Children, Starr Commonwealth Institute for Training\"Gil and colleagues provide a warm and insightful description of play-based healing for traumatized children. Compelling case examples illustrate therapeutic principles such as the need to decode children's play behavior and the ways in which play facilitates natural healing processes following trauma. I highly recommend this book for clinicians working with children who have experienced interpersonal trauma--the hope and healing are heartening!

Lively plotting and sound characterization enhance the tale of Sibell Delahunty, orphaned by a shipwreck that tosses her onto the beach with handsome, amoral Logan Conal. After being rescued from a band of hostile aborigines by a kind native named Jimmy Moon, the two make their way to Perth and part company. Having been mistreated by the family that takes her in, Sibell flees to an isolated outback station owned by the Hamilton clan. There her mettle is tested further as she encounters kindness as well as deception from the Hamiltons, finds brutality among settlers and natives and deals with thievery, death, fires and devastating cyclones. She meets up with Logan again and falls in love with him; Jimmy Moon is a constant presence--a \"noble savage\" who wears an emu feather and a stone from a secret site around his neck. Sibell survives betrayal and further tragedy before the somewhat anticlimactic resolution of this frontier adventure.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0093ARGLE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The timely fiction thriller, White Slavery, is a vivid account about slave traders, who kidnap, beat and train these unfortunate females to serve as sex objects and dancers for their ruthless, Arab masters.\nThe newly elected president of Tunisia hires an undercover person in Austria, named Sam, to help him eradicate the slave traffic in his country.  Sam knows two young gunsmiths, Benner and Heidel, experts in their methods of eliminating all sorts of undesirable characters in society.  They hunt Arab traffickers of human, white flesh, spanning from idyllic Europe to searing Tunisia and across the treacherous Mediterranean in their stainless steel cruiser.  They travel from the smoky and smelly dance halls of Austria to historic Genoa, Italy, where they search for the slave mongers.  They trek to the hot and humid Tunisian desert, where sheiks grossly mistreat white young females and camel boys and frequently leave them in the hot desert sand to die.\nAdil Abu Bakr, the Tunisian slave runner in charge, is feeling the pressure imposed on him by the new Tunisian president.  Benner and Heidel received a message from Sam, that the frustrated Tunisian President could use their expert help in restraining the flourishing slave trade.  They exercise their kind of justice and the president pays them by the number of slave trafficker's heads that they deliver.\nPolice Inspector Bruno Schultz is relentlessly investigating the murders of the Arab slave dealers.  However, circumstances compel him to take the middle road between right and wrong, a circumstance that the inspector has great difficulty dealing with.  Should he investigate the gunsmiths and persecute them or should he support them, to do away with the slave traffickers?", "related": ["B0067BDFL2"], "rank": 877551, "title": "White Slavery eBook", "author": "Arnold Inzko", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Following a dramatic prologue, the story centres on an ostensibly friendly party that actually hides a multitude of sins, simmering tensions, and dirty secrets. It's Mitchell Reynolds's 43rd birthday and he has invited a handful of his closest 'frenemies' to his big house in a stylish gated community. Before you can say 'bring me another dirty martini', there's a dead body on the patio, a star-studded list of potential suspects, and two world-weary homicide detectives at the front door.Blue Martinas is an entertaining 'there's a murderer in the house' style mystery that really kept me turning the pages. It has an intriguing starting point and continues to surprise or throw you off track with a fine series of twists and revelations. With the exception of cops Captain Thomas Maly and Lieutenant Doug Dooley, Brenda Limpert has deliberately created a stellar cast of believable but deeply unpleasant characters, each one so disagreeable and manipulative, you kind of hope they will be the next victim! I enjoyed reading Blue Martinas and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys golden-age style mysteries.\"", "related": [], "rank": 3774113, "title": "Blue Martinas", "author": "Brenda Limpert", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After assaulting the woman through the night, he fled New York and went on a weeks-long crime spree until his arrest in Memphis. A tabloid sensation, he was later sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 2011, Braunstein contacted Aaron Gell, an editor and colleague atW.magazine. Gell found his swaggering former friend \"amusing and genial\" and eventually accepted Braunstein's offer to visit him in prison and get \"the definitive interview.\" Over the course of subsequent interviews, letters, and phone calls, Gell strives to crash past Braunstein's wall of bravado and intellectual rationalizations for his crime. But in this honest and often uncomfortable story, Gell admits that he had always liked Braunstein, who even behind bars remained funny and smart. \"He filed on deadline, and his copy was clean... the guy seemed okay,\" Gell writes. And later: \"I still liked Peter, perhaps more so than when we'd worked together.\" But as the story progresses toward Braunstein's devolution into criminal madness, Gell acknowledges--slowly at first, then with self-flagellating honesty--that his charming and self-absorbed interviewee remained a manipulative and pathologically delusional creep: \"one part Hannibal Lecter, one part Lenny Bruce.\" It isn't until stumbling across police photographs of Braunstein's victim that Gell finally realizes \"how thoroughly I'd been snowed by him.\" Gell may not have gotten the Capote-esque story he'd hoped for, but give him credit for discrediting Braunstein's self-serving \"me-against-the-world\" narrative. --Neal Thompson", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": 1133434, "title": "Speak of the Devil (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Aaron Gell", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sarah hadn't a clue that she wanted to be an archaeologist until she traveled to Israel right after her freshman year in college. There she ate felafel, fell in love with Jerusalem, camped illegally on Masada, and spent a month at the excavation of biblical Beersheba. Once hooked by archaeology, she returned for her junior year at Tel Aviv University, an experience that changed her life. Back in the U.S., she completed her B.A. in Anthropology at Harvard University and volunteered in the Harvard Semitic Museum and the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Then she left her home state of Massachusetts and moved to Philadelphia for graduate school in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology at Bryn Mawr College. There she met a medical student, Charlie Wisseman, who became her husband in 1975. Sarah had just finished her M.A. and was working on her Ph.D when Charlie landed his first job as a pathologist working for the Public Health Service in Cincinnati. She seized the opportunity to learn more about art conservation by volunteering in the laboratory at the Cincinnati Art Museum.  When her husband migrated to a job in Urbana, Illinois, Sarah became a curator, grant writer, and fundraiser at the World Heritage Museum, located in a creepy, fourth-floor attic at the University of Illinois. Somehow she survived the experience of working there while raising two children, Nick and Emily. Then Sarah was lured away from the museum world into archaeological science. She currently directs the Program on Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials (ATAM), also at the University of Illinois.

In this absorbing book Danian Hu provides us with cogent and elegant answers. As an added bonus, Danian Hu humanizes his study by his numerous and vivid mini-biographies of Chinese physicists at many levels of expertise. The attempt by the leading ideologues of the Cultural Revolution to force through a radical rejection of Einstein's relativity theories provides a grim and gripping coda to a remarkable story.\" (Jonathan Spence, Sterling Professor of History, Yale University)China and Albert Einsteinis a novel and original contribution to the as yet seriously understudied but extremely important field, the history of science in modern China. It introduces a wealth of new information and greatly increases our knowledge about the reception and assimilation of Einstein's theory of relativity in China during the turbulent twentieth century. The study actually delivers even more, since by using relativity theory as a crucial example, Danian Hu explains some general features of the process of transplating modern science onto Chinese soil. (Alexei Kojevnikov, University of Georgia)I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I believe it is a highly original contribution, certainly to my own field of the history of relativity. It is the first study of the reception of relativity theory into a society with little background in nineteenth-century physics, and it is likely to be the most important of such studies, given China's substantial contribution to twentieth-century physics. Einstein scholars and biographers will find it extremely useful.

When Mikey falls into the swirling waters of the Seine, Joanna and Holly know their lives have been forever altered. Luckily, Mikey is rescued by a fast-thinking, strong-swimming fellow passenger, but Mikey’s accident still sets the wheels of fate in motion. Joanna, a sympathetic heroine attempting to handle her daughter’s postpartum depression while caring for Mikey and holding down a job, is the heart and soul of the novel. In this tale of second chances, shifting priorities, undeniable connections, and the power of fate, Candlish has crafted a tender, heartfelt story. Candlish’s ability to crack open the heart of a marriage will pique the interest of Marian Keyes fans, while her honest depiction of Holly’s postpartum depression is especially admirable. An insightful and driving novel, The Day You Saved My Life explores how far the bonds between husband and wife, mother and child, and victim and savior can bend before they’re severed. --Stephanie Turza", "related": ["B006Y0QZFO"], "rank": 972014, "title": "The Day You Saved My Life", "author": "Louise Candlish", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Irán acaba de probar su primera bomba atómica. Millones de musulmanes en todo el mundo están convencidos de que su mesías —conocido como el Duodécimo Imán— ha llegado al mundo. Los líderes israelíes temen que Teherán, bajo el maleficio del Duodécimo Imán, lance pronto un ataque nuclear que ocasionaría un segundo Holocausto y la aniquilación de Israel. La Casa Blanca teme que Jerusalén ataque primero, lanzando un masivo ataque preventivo contra las instalaciones nucleares de Irán, lo que podría ocasionar la violenta erupción del Medio Oriente, el alza descontrolada del precio del petróleo y el derrumbe de la economía mundial. Con riesgos tan altos y con pocas opciones factibles, el presidente de Estados Unidos ordena al agente de la CIA David Shirazi y a su grupo que localicen y destruyan las instalaciones nucleares de Irán antes de que Irán o Israel puedan lanzar un primer ataque devastador.

Name's Harrington.  I'm a lover of all things fantastical in nature, a fancier of eclectic music, an owner of taste buds that enjoy almost anything, and a strong proponent of all things diverse. If there's a way to cram a multitude of ideas into a single work of art, I'm guilty of it.  Growing up in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Alaska, I've molded a certain 'northern' attitude. I prefer the climates of the northern United States and, in particular, the larger cities that have taken root in the cold. I've always been a city kid. Always will be, I'd imagine. Though I've been a lifelong resident of the U.S., I always consider myself a citizen of the world first and an American second; I wish more of my countrymen shared this belief.  The arts have always been in my blood. After the better part of the past two decades playing music, I decided to retire my bass guitar and get back to the passion I'd pursued at an earlier age, dumping my imagination into a series of words. Music was a powerful part of life, and I may return to it someday, but the writer in me has a lot of catching up to do.  I enjoy a relatively simple life in the suburbs. I live with the most amazing woman in the world who continues to inspire me to be better. I'm within a short drive of my beautiful daughter and granddaughter. I have a particularly cute cat that won't leave me alone and knows how to push my buttons, and I have a loving, extended family that I'll always cherish.", "related": ["B00CR77NCC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nan's daughter Alex believes that her powerful husband has been sexually abusing their four-year-old daughter, Jane; she begs Nan to take Jane out of Seattle and into hiding until Alex can gain temporary custody. Nan and Jane flee to Providence, where Nan's closest friend has recently moved, but they arrive to find the friend has died days before. That leaves Nan in an unfamiliar city with a faked identity, limited cash and responsibility for a preschooler, but Nan was married to a Foreign Service man and she's tenacious. She's also a perceptive, witty and self-involved protagonist, but she's repeatedly rescued by strangers which makes the plot hard to swallow. And while Harleman's wry humor and vivid descriptions are in play throughout, significant questions remain unanswered by the end of the novel's bumpy ride.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her mother, a respected anthropologist, often travels abroad to study ancient civilizations, leaving the 13-year-old with her father. When her dad, a paleontologist, is asked to lead an expedition in the Arctic to uncover the possible remains of a woolly mammoth, Maya goes along. The expedition is funded by a wealthy adventurer, and he has included a host of international scientists, some with questionable intentions-one has ties to the Russian mob and another plans to take the mammoth's DNA back to Japan to clone it. Kyle, a boy Maya's age, is accompanying his mother, another scientist on the team. When it turns out that there is no woolly mammoth, but rather a unique mystical creature hidden in the ice, Maya and Kyle decide to join forces to save it from further destructive scientific experimentation. With the first half of the novel grounded firmly in the world of science, the transition to the realm of the magical and improbable in the second half is a bit surprising. However, Maya is an earnest and likable character and the plot is fast-paced enough to hold readers' attention. Maya's curiosity, bravery, and desire to do the right thing will resonate with many readers.-Ragan O'Malley, Saint Ann's School, Brooklyn, NYα(c) Copyright 2011.

The father of two, Bruce is also the trophy husband of burlesque diva Miss Rosie Bitts.

Since then, his first short story, \"Another Man's Shoes\" was published in the Winter 2008 edition of Cemetery Moon, another short, \"Yardwork\", was made into a podcast in Oct., 2011 by Pseudopod and his first Icarus Fell novel, \"On Unfaithful Wings\", was published to Kindle in Dec., 2011.

After grabbing a degree\n from UNC-Chapel Hill, he remembered just what he lost.The Icarus Trilogy was Kauffmann's first professional project\nand he started on Murder of Crows back in April, 2010. In July of that\nyear, Kauffmann was told that his grandmother had been diagnosed with\ncancer, which caused Murder of Crows to become an entirely different\nproject. In order to cope with his grief, Kauffmann's writing became\nfocused on how his characters dealt with loss, both in the form of\npersonal identity and actually losing the people closest to them.Now, Kauffmann has decided to create an entirely new kind of\nstory with The Forsaken Comedy, a series devoted to the Four Horsemen\nand their rise from Hell.  The second book, Ghosts of Earth, was just\nreleased in February, and the finale, In Defiance of Heaven, will be out\n by Summer 2014.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 24.0}

Lambert and Hook, the Gloucestershire cops (they’re a chief superintendent and detective sergeant, respectively), investigate the murder of a National Trust curator—in terms familiar to North American readers, he’s basically the curator of a national historical site—who, by all accounts, seems to have led a pleasant enough life. Although, as Lambert and Hook discover as they dig beneath the surface, and as they have often discovered over these many years, the most peaceful of lives can conceal unexpected dark corners. As usual, the characters are solidly constructed (and not just the two familiar series leads but the supporting players as well), the setting is well imagined, and the story offers readers enough surprises and misdirection to keep them on their toes. Although it might exist under the radars of many readers, this series is well worth a look. --David Pitt", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": 1204183, "title": "More than Meets the Eye (The Lambert and Hook Mysteries Book 25) eBook", "author": "J.

This story-within-a-story setup makes it well suited for audio adaptation, as Scales takes the housekeeper's part and relates the past, while West performs as the tenant and describes the present. Scales primarily uses a folksy lower-class accent, but she also makes her voice harsh and threatening when speaking as Heathcliff, the surly man at the novel's heart. West, as the bewildered tenant, manages to sound both nervous and pretentious, but his part is fairly small, especially with this abridgment, so he mostly serves to provide transitions for the housekeeper's story. The extensive abridgment generally deletes sentences and phrases rather than entire paragraphs or sections. One drawback for the audio format is the difficulty of clarifying the novel's convoluted plot and family tree, since it's harder to search back through long CD tracks than through earlier chapters of the paperback. While a little of the depth of Bronte's writing is lost in abridgment, the novel's emotional core remains intact and wrenching, and the actors' heartfelt interpretations make it easy to imagine being curled up by a warm fire listening to an absorbing tale. In June, Penguin Audio remastered and released on CD for the first time nine other Penguin Classics: Crime and Punishment, Dracula, Frankenstein, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Moby Dick, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Tale of Two Cities.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This awakening taught him what love is and why that love is necessary before we can attract \"the one who will make our heart sing.\" It led him to finally write his latest book, \"How Do I Find True Love?\" He realized that this book would enable anyone to quickly understand another person in less than an hour by reading sky charts. It is a remarkable achievement because, due to the complexity of astrology. this had never been done before.

Lin is destined to become a great person in the annals of her planet's history -- the emancipator of Luratia's last slave race -- but she doesn't know this yet; she's only ten years old.The Luratia Chroniclesexplores how an exceptionally bright child with a big heart and a handful of flaws takes charge of her destiny and makes for herself an amazing, beautiful life of service and advocacy. But great lives are not easy lives, and through every stage of maturity, Lin grapples with inner and outer struggles: impatience, impulsiveness, guilt, pride, and the persistent array of life's hardships.The Luratia Chronicles, too, is an educational science fiction series that realistically explores what a planet's evolutionary arc might look like if:The super-material graphene is developed abundantly and with ever-wiser applications that improve the quality of medicine, machinery, engineering, architecture, communications, transportation modes, and construction materials. Graphene is so new a discovery on Earth, few people outside of nanotechnology research and academia know of its existence. But we soon will. Graphene will outshine the contributions of steel, plastic, and the silicon chip as transformative milestones in Earth's long evolutionary adventure.Energy is harvested directly from the sun on satellite platforms in near orbit and in such volume that it can be distributed free to all corners of the world. Implementing the technique of wireless energy distribution first introduced by Nicolas Tesla, real-time sun energy is distributed planet-wide through the air, eliminating the need for batteries or fuel storage facilities.Science and love are intelligently paired. The applications of rapidly advancing technology are guided by a high regard for the greater good and an uncompromising respect for the health of people and planet. Population growth is limited to ensure a higher quality of life; machines free people from dangerous manual labor but do not contribute to unemployment; international collaboration in research and development leads to unprecedented advancements; and innovations in economics begin to evolve the planet from a profit-motive exploiter of natural resources to a service-motive society founded on cooperation, creative collaboration, kindness and goodwill.", "related": [], "rank": 2195102, "title": "How to be Happy on a Cloudy Planet (The Exoplanetary Life of Lin of Luratia Book 1)", "author": "Melanie Pahlmann", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hobbs lives in a small town in Northeast Texas, with her husband, son, and the sweetest cat that has ever graced the Earth. She has always enjoyed reading stories filled with romance, adventure, fantasy, and mystery.  In recent years, however, she has taken these passions to a new height in discovering her own voice through writing fiction.This challenge began for her several years ago when she took a huge step and nervously joined an online group of young writers, who had the same passion she did for exploring other possible plots for their favorite stories. She had almost completed her first lengthy such project and felt she needed to find a place where others could enjoy reading it as well.When that project ended at approximately 110,000 words, she knew she could do more and searched for a way to put her talent and love of writing into motion for a more beneficial means.For her, writing is a way of traveling to places and times that would otherwise be impossible to touch and feel.  She has found the ability to create new characters and form their lives rewarding, and it brings her a feeling of accomplishment.Through writing, she has found that she not only feels better about herself, she also has a great sense of satisfaction knowing that she has created something that someone else can enjoy.For this author, romance is a fundamental component in what she enjoys writing.  Whether it is the Native American captive tale or a historical novel set on the rolling, misty moors in 18th century England, she loves sharing the world she has created with others.T.M. Hobbs has had the good fortune of having several of her short stories and novels published.  She has worked with Books To Go Now and Gypsy Shadow Publishing, to name a few.", "related": [], "rank": 3828632, "title": "Forbidden Kin", "author": "T.M.

My images were journalistic in style\n and focussed on problems in the world, sad stories, homeless people and\n I even had a whole series on graveyards. It is as if I lived in a world\n full of only bad things.I gave up photography for a long time\nas I focussed on my first career in software development and when I\npicked up a camera again my view of life began to change. By nature, I\nsee all the negative things in the world. That comes easy. I have to put\n effort into seeing the good so I made a decision to only photograph\nbeautiful things.Using photography to guide what I focus on\nevery day is changing my outlook on life. Now I see the goodness and\nbeauty in the world and it makes me a happier person.Two years\nago I took another leap. I gave up my home in Victoria, BC, Canada,\nclosed my software consulting business, bought an RV and hit the road\nfor the life of a nomadic photographer. I wanted a happier more\nfulfilling life. I wanted the life I dreamed about. People tell me I am\nbrave and they wish they could do what I did. For me, it felt like the\nonly option that was right and good.I hope my story and images\nwill inspire other people to change the way they view the world and the\nway they live their lives. Changing your life is not as difficult or\nscary as it seems! What is scary is not doing it.Today I am a\nsuccessful photographer, author and teacher.

A worker and a listener, Peggy grew up in a remote hollow in the Appalachian Mountains of Northwest North Carolina, and has spent most every day of her life absorbed in some type of farm work. Her heritage shows from head to toe -- in her tough, work-worn hands, and in the easy, flowing cadence of her mountain voice. Always curious, she wants to know everyone's story and has a knack of getting it -- from the old timers of her childhood to all the other people she has come across since -- from laborers to affluent developers. One cannot encounter Peggy without sharing stories. Many of her stories have roots in her own experiences:  Her dad grew beans and raised livestock. Her mother worked at a local factory to supplement the farming income. Relatives, extended family, and church provided a unique atmosphere for living and learning the old mountain traditions. She married at seventeen, finished high school, and started a family. She furthered her education at Appalachian State, but the responsibilities of six children quickly made formal study impossible. She did manage to write a few manuscripts on an old portable typewriter. Her husband teased about her spelling and sentence structure, causing her to become somewhat disillusioned with writing. She turned to crafts to assist in the struggle for survival, marketed her crafts through Blue Ridge Hearthside Crafts Cooperative, and became a board member for the organization. Moving to her own farm, she continued to raise her own food, adding a milk cow and other livestock. Tobacco was the main cash crop. Christmas trees were planted to assist the children through college. Being active in agriculture, Peggy became a board member of Farm Bureau Insurance, the local Christmas Tree Association, NC Agricultural Extension Advisory Council, and NC State University. These positions enabled her to experience some of the life beyond the mountains. For more than thirty years, Peggy assisted her husband -- a land surveyor-- with the field and office work. Through contacts made with a developer client, she started selling her Christmas trees on a lot in Naples, Florida, becoming known there as the \"The Christmas Tree Lady\". The survey business gave Peggy additional insight on the impacts -- good and bad -- to the community as the mountains became a tourist and second home destination.   As the children grew up, went to college, married and had families of their own, there became time for writing. Wanting to know if she was good enough to write seriously, she attended many classes and joined a local writers group. During a luncheon, Terry Kay told her \"All words are the same. It's how you use them that makes the difference\". He also advised her to write something that wasn't personal. Her first (2003) published novel, Heaven-High and Hell-deep, resonates with Peggy's unique strong voice and storytelling ability. Always resourceful, Peggy decided she would not only write books, but she'd make and market them herself. Consequently, every book is uniquely hers: she writes the stories, paints the cover picture, then prints and binds each one at her farm.  Whether from her experiences, shared stories, or from the spirits of the past; characters keep evolving in Peggy's imagination. Then they nag her until she relates their story. Often she is working on seven or eight novels simultaneously, completing one for the character that becomes the most persistent. They just have to deal with Peggy casting their stories in her beloved mountains.", "related": ["B00BRM7QCU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In an invigorating approach to IR, it provides students with the concepts they need to understand the world around them while not limiting them to one perspective.(Eric K. Leonard, Henkel Family Chair in International Affairs, Shenandoah University)Introduction to International Relationsis a textbook suitable for an introductory international relations course. The author begins the first chapter by describing the different levels of analysis and concludes by defining globalization and noting how it impacts the study of international relations. In chapter 2 the main international relations theories (i.e., realism, liberalism, constructivism, Marxism, and feminism) and their variants are introduced. The author does a good job of describing and providing critiques of each theory. Chapter 3 explains the state level including the Treaty of Westphalia, balance of power and alliances, national interest, war, and peace. Actions inside of states are the focus of chapter 4, which includes an explanation of government, culture, ethnic conflict, and the role of the individual. Nonstate actors are examined in chapter 5, including intergovernmental organizations (with emphasis on the UN, NATO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the EU), NGOs, and multinational corporations. The final chapter seeks to provide real-world examples of the key concepts and issues inherent in international relations by examining how states in the system can solve problems concerning the environment, human rights, and immigration.

Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world.She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.

Dalton bestsellers list, a feat never achieved before or since by any author. Barbara Cartland became a legend in her own lifetime and will be best remembered for her wonderful romantic novels so loved by her millions of readers throughout the world, who have always collected her books to read again and again, especially when they feel miserable or depressed. Her books will always be treasured for their moral message, her pure and innocent heroines, her handsome and dashing heroes, her blissful happy endings and above all for her belief that the power of love is more important than anything else in everyone’s life.", "related": ["B00JDNI4QC"], "rank": 464945, "title": "105.

Katherine has lived in the south-east of England for most of her life, but her father's family come from the Isle of Arran in Scotland and this has been the inspiration for the fictional Island of Garansay, which is the stunning backdrop to this novel. Katherine's life-long interest in History also plays an important part in her writing and she tries to weave historical narratives into her imaginative and ingenious plots. Katherine is currently working on the second in the series of 'Imogen and Hugh Croft mysteries', which should appeal to readers who enjoy her well observed characters and gripping storylines. Katherine feels that a good psychological thriller should explore the quirks and eccentricities  of human nature, but that they should always be believable and the plot should reward the reader with a deeply satisfying conclusion. Katherine enjoys writing the sort of novels that she likes to read herself and very much hopes that her readership feels the same!", "related": ["B00LNLVQ9Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age of 15 he went off to join the British Royal Air Force ... and never looked back.  These were exciting times to be part of a Hi-Tech military unit with the cold war in full swing and the possibility of a nuclear strike against the west imminent. After leaving the Air Force and with a restless outlook, he took on several jobs that took him travelling across Eastern and Western Europe and then into Africa. Nurturing an unfortunate ability of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Quentin finally found himself caught up in the horrific Biafra conflict in Nigeria and with a certain amount of scarred memory tissue to prove the point, he decided to travel East in search of less wearing adventures. In the early 70's, Quentin headed for Dubai: for the smell of the spice souk, the sail of the Dhow outlined on a distant horizon and the promise of a fortune at the end of a Middle Eastern rainbow. For the next 25 years, he was fortunate enough to witness and become part of the extrodinary growth of a place that literally rose out of a desert wasteland like a golden Pheonix ... accompanied by the continuing horror of yet even more war. After returning to the UK in the late 90's, still restless, Quentin decided to spend some 'writing time' in Spain, a decision that has served him well with the completion and publishing of eight books to the middle of 2013 and another full length novel on the drawing board.   Books by Quentin Cope: Fiction: Nostradamus: The Last Christmas The Geneveh Project.

In Interrogating the Real, the first volume of his collected writings. Slavoj Zizek proves that as a scholar he is as absurdly prolific as he is incorrigibly entertaining. Lauded by Terry Eagleton on the back cover of the book as \"the most formidably brilliant exponent of psychoanalysis, indeed of cultural theory in general, to have emerged from Europe in some decades,\" Zizek is known for his fast and loose style and his penchant for fiddling with philosophy, psychoanalysis and cultural studies all in one fell swoop. Whether you love him or hate him, it is indisputable that Zizek has made quite a name for himself and has assumed the status of an academic rock star.Appropriately, then, Interrogating the Real stands as a sort of greatest hits album. The book is an assemblage of fifteen pieces, dating mainly from the 1980's and 1990's. Of varying length and form, the pieces range from transcriptions of interviews and lectures to reprinted journal articles or book chapters. Although most of the essays have already appeared elsewhere, some of them had not yet been translated into English or were only available in journals that are not readily accessible to most readers. It is thus useful tot have the pieces collected into one easy to access volume.\"Cristina Laurita, February 2007 , Janus Head, Summer/Fall Open issue 2006, 9.1. \"A critically important acquisition for academic library philosophy collections and student reading lists, this first volume of Professor Zizek's work is divided into three principle sections: 'Lacanian Orientations'; 'Philosophy Traversed by Psychoanalysis'; and 'The Fantasy of Ideology'. Enhanced with a glossary, an index, and an 'Author's Afterword: Why Hegel is a Lacanian', \"Interrogating the Real\" showcases impeccable scholarship and clearly documents Professor Zizek as an original and insightful philosopher in his own right.\" - The Midwest Book Review \"A...wiser approach for the uninitiated would be to go straight to Interrogating the Real. Advertised as the first volume in Zizek's collected works, this book is really a volume of selected essays. What distinguishes it from many of Zizek's other books that could also be described in that way, is that Butler and Stephens' superb collection of well chosen and carefully arranged pieces of writing provides an excellent introduction to Zizek's unwieldy oeuvre...a close reading of Interrogating the Real will show that a sustained engagement with Europe's anti-habermas while he is in his prime, can only enrich philosophy.\" -Roderick Nicholls, Philosophy in Review Reviewed in Common Knowledge, Volume 14, Issue 1.

She loves to craft strong, enigmatic men and bright, sassy women to give them a hard time—in every sense of the word.

With generous illustrations and simple explanations, Erica and Steve will help you get more out of Siri. Much more.”--Chuck Joiner, MacVoices“It’s easy to dismiss Siri as a fun novelty that gives amusing answers to ‘Open the pod bay doors, Siri.’ But Siri is a remarkably useful tool. The authors ofTalking to Sirimake it fast and easy to learn how to put it to use, whether that’s the quickest way to call your husband, schedule a reminder (‘When I get home, remind me to...’), or find out the baseball score. The writing is delightful, and the information full of ‘Gosh, how cool!’”--Esther Schindler, Technology Journalist“Steve and Erica’s knowledge of Siri is surpassed only by the clarity with which they explain it.

Expressed from the injured boy himself, Asaf, we learn\nin a moving yet careful way (with no tendency for exaggeration) about his life\nuntil the attack and his and his family's coping after. \"Then, I didn't know\nthat there were terrorist attacks that force you to mature, instantly,\nthousands of years,\" Asaf refers to his childhood.Throughout the story, the\ntreatments in the hospital, the leg and hand that are no longer there, the\nfamily, the mother who passed away along with other characters, the moving and\nexciting integration, is all focused in the most personal way on the fate of a\nwounded boy fighting for his physical and mental health. \"It doesn't matter how\nmany surgeries I have been through, I will never go back to being who I used to\nbe,\" says Asaf to his grandmother with a linked acceptance and distress. \"The\nTenth\" surgery planned for Asaf will successfully be detached from the scene of\nthe attack and the corridors of the hospital by reaching the emotions of every\nyoung adult.", "related": [], "rank": 1121233, "title": "The Tenth: Psychological & Family Life Inspiring Novel (Women's Literary Fiction Book 1)", "author": "Smadar Shir", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 19, "rating_average": 4.8421, "rating_total": 92.0}
