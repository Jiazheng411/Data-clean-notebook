Jeremy Iversen, a 24-year-old Stanford graduate and the author of the novel 21, infiltrated California's Mirador High (fictional name, real school) for a semester to find out. Posing as a high-school transfer student, Iversen discovers what many have discovered before: that high school is \"an institution founded on popularity, sports, ass kissing, and corruption.\" Although Iversen's tone can be entertaining and his descriptions occasionally catch the reader's attention, his story-of an almost out-of-control school in which social cliques (the jocks, nerds, skaters, etc. of any '80s film), alcohol and sex rule and the principal and many teachers are clueless figureheads-is one that has been told too many times. Iversen also has a penchant for grandiose statements about the school system (\"The vast and functional cycle, far greater than she or any other entity, would repeat without end until the civilization that sustained it ultimately dissolved as all phenomena must\"), and the author's preface about \"compromises with characters and chronology\" hobbles reportorial integrity.

But\nthe Romans, the Greeks, the British, the Russians, all declined in\ngreatness, power and influence... some collapsed outright... and today,\nare remembered for their former glory, not as they are today.

And this, while the\nU.S. was being attacked by terrorist foes, while foreign banks were\nbuying up our properties and credit, while our economy was failing, our\nproducts were not selling, and other countries were beginning to flex\ntheir muscle, against others, yes, but most especially against the might\n of America.And at the same time, other readers attacked me for\nsuggesting that the United Nations should and would assume role of World\n Government that it had coveted for so long. The U.N. was accused of\nbeing impotent, corrupt, stupid and ineffective, and therefore incapable\n of governing. No one commented on the incredible resistance the U.N.\nhas had since its inception, primarily from the superpowers (like the\nU.S., and others of course) that refused to bend to the U.N.'s edicts,\ndenied support when it inconvenienced them, and outright blocked their\nefforts in the name of sovereignty.In the midst of all this, the issues of immigration and\ndiscrimination were whispers in a tornado of nationalism, and the\nstubborn refusal to recognize the fact that sooner or later,all empires fall.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dow was a man of varied talents and interests who left an indelible mark not only on the field of journalism, but also on the world of finance. In 1882 he established, along with Edward D. Jones, the Dow Jones financial news service, and seven years later founded the Wall Street Journal. His greatest legacy, however, may be the Dow Theory, the \"stock market barometer\" that is arguably the single most important —and reliable —forecasting tool ever developed.A comprehensive and authoritative look at this invaluable market gauge was first provided in 1922 by William Peter Hamilton, a financial journalist and Dow contemporary who explored the thinking behind the Dow Theory and its ramifications in The Stock Market Barometer. Widely regarded as the definitive word on the subject, this priceless investment classic celebrates its diamond jubilee with a handsome new edition to enlighten, instruct, and inspire a new generation.Among the best strategies for understanding and determining trends in the market, the Dow Theory—a deceptively simple concept that focuses exclusively on the movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average—has maintained, despite momentous changes in the marketplace, an impressive track record over the years. Its consistently high rate of performance is a testament to its credibility in predicting where the market is headed.In The Stock Market Barometer, William Hamilton's clear and in-depth analysis explores the Dow Theory's underlying principles, its explanation of averages and its remarkable affinity for predictable cycles of panic and prosperity. More than just a blueprint of the Theory, however, Hamilton's cogent discussion provides a concise examination of the stock market and its history since 1897, as well as thorough descriptions of the notable trends he observed during a distinguished career. His undisputed gifts of insight and interpretation bring focus and flavor to his candid views on a variety of vital topics, including market manipulation, speculation, and regulation.Ageless in its directness, approach, and success rate, the Dow Theory has withstood the test of time. So, too, has The Stock Market Barometer. A springboard from which current Dow Theory has thrived, this priceless work remains as vital a guide to market prediction as when it first appeared seventy-five years ago.\"Hard drives didn't exist in Charles Dow or William Peter Hamilton's day nearly 100 years ago. Yet, these two men developed and refined a market forecasting tool that is still better than anything I've ever seen on Wall Street. . . . If you are a serious student of investing, you owe it to yourself to 'go back to the future' and read this book.\" —from the Foreword by Charles B. Carlson.\"Hard drives didn't exist in Charles Dow or William Peter Hamilton's day nearly 100 years ago.

She was suffering from a bad case of Poor-Me Syndrome.Greedy, ambitious CEOs like Leo Storm were supposed to play it safe when it came to sex. They were supposed to carry wallets full of condoms and fall asleep after doing it once.Apparently Leo hadn't read his CEO rule book on said subject. His skill and enthusiastic ardor as a lover had made Abigail's toes tingle and her bones melt. She'd opened herself to him in ways that had caused her to despise herself and blame him the next morning. They'd done it so many times, she'd been tender for days. Needless to say, she'd avoided the heck out of him ever since.So, the discovery that she was pregnant—by Leo— sucked big-time.You can have anything you want—as long as you're willing to pay the price,her mother used to say. Trouble was, the price was due, and Abby didn't want to pay.Ever since she'd found out about her condition last week, she'd been wallowing in self-misery—not that she was proud of such childish behavior.As soon as she'd gotten up this morning and had finished going to the bathroom, desperation had overwhelmed her again, and she'd flipped the toilet lid down and collapsed on it, sniveling like a baby. A little later she'd had another good cry while knocking her forehead against the wet tiles of her shower.As if buckets full of tears or regrets—and don't forget whining—did any good. Some things just had to be faced.Pregnant! By Leo Storm!She was a control freak and single with no desire for a long-term alliance of any kind after being hurt so badly when her boyfriend, Shanghai Knight, had dumped her.Since puberty she'd gone for short-term relationships with cowboys like Shanghai; not for boring, bossy, calculating, corporate, money guys without souls like Leo. She'd been the brains, and the cowboys been the brawn.She licked her lips and wiped the sweat off her brow. Well, she wasn't going to cry again. No use indulging in any more pity parties. She was a big girl—whether she was acting like one or not. She could handle this. Shehadto handle this.Which was why she was telling Leo today. Surely she'd feel better once that was behind her. She closed her eyes and tried not to think about Leo's white, drawn face and blazing black eyes the last time she'd seen him. He'd been furious at her. Not only furious—he'd said he was through with her.Usually being in the barn with Coco, her gentle palomino, soothed her. Not today. Not when she dreaded driving into San Antonio and telling a certain stubborn, macho CEO, who was now refusing to take her calls, thattheyhad a little problem.Every time she bent over to scoop another pitchfork load of manure and dirty straw into the wheelbarrow, the zipper of her jeans slid a little lower, reminding her oftheirmutual problem andthatnight, that one night with him that she'd tried so hard to forget.Not that he'd wanted to forget. He'd made it very clear he'd wanted her—again and again. He was nothing if not determined. He'd called her both at home and at her office. He'd dropped by, but finally when she'd rejected him for about the tenth time, he'd become so angry he'd issued his ultimatum—which she'd ignored.Having rid himself of her, he wouldn't be happy to learn thatthatnight was now every bit as impossible for her to forget as it had been for him.Heaving in a breath, she rested her pitchfork against the wheelbarrow and tugged her zipper back up. She was panting by the time she'd managed it, so she didn't even try to snap the waistband. The jeans had been tight when she'd bought them, but since she'd planned to take off a couple of pounds, she hadn't worried about it.No chance of losing those pounds anytime soon.As she stooped to pick up the pitchfork, the cell phone in her back pocket vibrated against her hip. She threw the pitchfork back down hard, and it stabbed a mound of hay so violently that Coco, who was just outside the stall, danced backward, her hooves clattering on the concrete floor.Oh, God, what if her big darling slipped because of her thoughtlessness?\"Easy girl,\" she whispered, her tone gentle even as the stench of straw and urine and horse in such close quarters caused nausea to roil in her stomach.She hoped against hope that Leo had relented and was returning her call like a reasonable individual. Maybe he'd even agree to stop by her ranch house tonight to talk. Much as she would dread seeing him, it would be so nice if she could avoid the drive to San Antonio and the humiliation of fighting her way into his office after he'd made it clear he never wanted to see her again.Not that she could blame him for that. Her heart knocked as she remembered accusing him of not being able to take no for an answer and of stalking her. He'd hissed in a breath. But she'd seen the acute pain in his black eyes right before he'd whirled, pitched the roses he'd brought her into the trash and quietly walked back to his truck. Later he'd called her and had delivered his ultimatum, which, for some weird reason, she'd replayed at least a dozen times in her mind. Did she enjoy suffering or what?Instead of Leo's name, the number of In the Pink!, Abigail's own company located on a side street just off Congress Avenue in downtown Austin lit up the blue LED of her mobile phone.Kel, her executive secretary, best friend, unpaid therapist… and of late, her number-one shoulder to cry on, was calling.Damn.Abigail sagged against the wall of the barn. A tear rolled down her cheek as she caught her breath. Then she swallowed and squeaked out a hello that she'd meant to sound chirpy.\"Hey, Abby, do you have a cold or something?\"\"Or something.\" Abigail felt frozen. \"This thing has me all messed up.\"\"I know. Hormones.\"Or the terror of Leo Storm, of what he would say and do to her this morning at her news, especially after the way she'd treated him.\"Other than feeling like I'm about to have a nervous breakdown, I'm fine. Never better.\" Somehow she managed a hollow laugh. \"As fine as someone with morning sickness can be, mucking out a stall… before they face a firing squad.\"\"You need to hire somebody for that yucky-mucky stuff now.\"A city girl through and through, Kel didn't get horses.\"I know. You're right. I will.\"\"So, anything I need to know before I start scheduling your day?\"\"Yes. I-I'm going to tell him… today.\"\"Oh? When exactly?\"\"This morning! First thing!\"\"Wow. Well, finally!\"\"Putting it off is driving me crazy. The only problem is it looks like I'm going to have to track him down. He won't return my calls.\"\"You should have listened to your smart secretary. Didn't I tell you, you should call him and apologize—\"\"Smart-assed secretary!\"\"Big-assed, too.\" Kel laughed. \"And getting bigger. Jan brought in two dozen donuts this morning coated with yummy strawberry goo. I'm inhaling my second.\"\"Okay. Well, I didn't call him back or apologize. And ever since, he's avoided the ranch and me. Now he won't even take my calls or call me back.\"\"Why are we surprised?\"\"I said it was urgent. I've left several messages with his secretary, too. Yesterday, she actually got snappy and said he had no intention of returning my calls. I can't tell you how humiliating that was. I'm not about to tell a witch like her to tell him I'm pregnant with his child, so I guess I have to drive over there.\"\"Right. You think you'll getbackhere this afternoon?\"\"After lunch. I'll probably be a basket case after seeing him.\"\"Do you want me to cancel your afternoon?\"\"No!\"\"Is there anything I can do?\" Kel's voice was soft with concern.\"Just be your smart-assed self and put out any and all home fires.\"\"Don't worry about us,\" Kel said. \"Just take care of you.\"They hung up.Abigail's hands began to shake again as she slid her phone in her back pocket. Compulsively, she began marching back and forth in the barn, straightening tack that didn't need to be straightened, lining up bottles and brushes on shelves, trying to feel she controlled something. She got a broom and began to sweep the feed that Coco had shaken out of the feed sack when she'd grabbed it by her teeth earlier.Coco walked up and lowered her head almost apologetically. It was her way of begging for her favorite treat, a mixture of oats and molasses.\"Not today, big girl. Not after this big mess you made!\"Setting the broom against the wall, Abby pushed the wheelbarrow full of dirty straw outside the barn and up a small hill where she dumped it before heading toward the house. Coco, who adored her, trailed behind her in the hope of being stroked or fed, but Abby was too distracted to notice her as she usually did.Pregnant! By Leo….Even though Abigail had taken the pregnancy tests a week ago—three of them—she still couldn't believe she was in this mess. She was a businesswoman, an entrepreneur with a staff of forty, the owner of her own ranch. Make that a ranchette. But still… she wasla capitanaof her ship! Even if she'd sailed headlong into the rocks.She reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. Quickly she scrolled down to Leo's cell number and punched it. Once again she listened to it ring until his voice mail picked up. So, he still refused to answer. She flipped her phone shut and began to pace.So what else was new? She'd watched him screen his calls, so it was easy to imagine his black eyes grimly eyeing her name before his jaw tightened and he thrust...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These are switchpoints. Like a train in motion, corporate culturesencounter many switchpoints along the way—points where executive decisions create watershed change and define the organization's future route.SwitchPoints is the inspiring story of how Canadian National Railway (CN) advanced from good to great in a few short years, becoming North America'stop-performing railroad—a favorite with bothcorporate customers and investors. Decisions by CN's leaders at critical switchpoints were key, as was the commitment of CN's dynamic CEO inleading the change.In SwitchPoints, the authors share how company-wide culture change propelled this aging transportation giant to become the profitable powerhouse it is today. Rich with anecdotes, SwitchPoints offers lessons learned and demonstrates the powerful behavioral tools used to change the culture to drive outstanding results in any organization.The authors—two CN executives and two consultantsfrom the Continuous Learning Group (CLG)—describe their firsthand experiences of applyingbehavioral science to change CN's culture. Theyalso share how they clarified CN's vision, selectedcritical switchpoints, employed managementtools for change, assessed their impact onprofitability, and \"spiked the switches\" to sustain the new culture.The leadership practices presented here are directly applicable to any business. Even if your enterprise is non-industrial, or your company's culture is very different from CN's, what worked for CN will work for you, too—because behavioral tools apply to all people in any culture, country, language, or industry worldwide. The methods in SwitchPoints apply to any organization and will help enlighten leadership that seeks to improve the bottom line by improving culture.Discover more at www.switchpointsbook.com.", "related": [], "rank": 485795, "title": "SwitchPoints", "author": "Judy Johnson", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fans will rejoice—in their own dystopian way—at the arrival of this mesmerizing installment. Ohle presents a parallel universe where people travel in vehicles called Q-peds; subsist on starch bars, urpmilk and perhaps some imp-meat; and get drunk on Jake and stoned on willywhack to dull the anxieties of the age, which are many. The blighted landscape is overrun by stinkers suffering the final zombie-like stage of a parasite infection, and an unspecified Chaos perpetually threatens Pisstown. Then there is the deranged authority, the American Divine, led by Reverend Hooker. In this world, readers follow the fortunes of the Balls family. Grandmother Mildred is quarantined with a mild parasite infection and must protect a corral of stinkers from wild imps. At the family estate, Mildred's granddaughter, Ophelia, battles stinkers burrowing under the house until she receives orders from Hooker. Ophelia's brother, Roe, eventually comes under Hooker's sway as well. Ohle's creation of a vivid world, both familiar and foreign, dark and slyly humorous, makes the book a grim delight.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Born in Llandudno, Wales, \"Mattie,\" as she was known, immigrated with her Mormon convert family to America in 1860. Her ill father died within days of their arrival in Salt Lake City, her baby sister having perished on the trek across the plains. These deaths and the poor health care in general that she observed in Utah helped steer her into medicine, which, as Graña points out in telling detail, was quite primitive at the time, especially on the frontier. After receiving her M.D. from the University of Michigan, Mattie helped establish Salt Lake City's Deseret Hospital, one of whose directors, Angus Cannon, she secretly married in 1884. Since Angus already had three wives and the federal government had outlawed polygamy, Mattie and her first child, a daughter born in 1885, ended up spending two years abroad, mostly in England, in a futile effort to prevent Angus's arrest for unlawful cohabitation. After the LDS church renounced polygamy in 1890, opening the way to Utah statehood, Mattie became active in the women's suffrage movement, though the Utah territory already allowed women to vote. In 1896, Mattie, a Democrat, defeated Angus, a Republican, among other candidates, for a seat in the new Utah state senate, becoming the first woman state senator in the U.S. During the two terms she served, she promoted legislation to improve public health, at the same time tending to her medical practice and raising her children with little financial or emotional support from Angus. The birth of a second daughter in 1899 put an end to her political career and led, once again, to Angus's arrest for unlawful cohabitation. Graña's criticisms-of the hypocrisy of those Mormon leaders who continued to take new wives after 1890, of the trend within the Mormon church in recent decades to limit women to the home-may offend the LDS faithful. Those interested in how a smart, independent woman struggled to balance family and career while remaining true to her religious beliefs will find this an absorbing and moving story.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Brian is particularly aware of the potential value of comics since he once accidentally destroyed his father's valuable Superman #1. The two friends are excited when the owner of their favorite store presents them with a brand-new title, TimeQuest. They discover that all the panels are blank except for a note on the last page describing how to use the comic as a time machine. Of course, they're sure it's all a joke until Paul accidentally triggers a quick, dangerous jaunt back to dinosaur times. Brian then decides to use the device to go back to 1939 and replace his dad's lost treasure. Unfortunately, the TimeQuest technology is unreliable at best, and the boys are suddenly off on a wild time-hopping odyssey. They are attacked by prehistoric cave dwellers, trapped by futuristic aliens, and lost in the far future. To make things worse, they pick up a companion in 1939, a girl who will be Brian's grandmother. The TimeQuest book panels fill in their adventures as they try to retrieve the Superman issue, avoid changing history, and get back to their own era alive. This lighthearted science-fiction story has plenty of quick action. The dialogue is crisp and natural with an abundance of middle school humor. There's also a subtle message about responsibility and friendship.Elaine E.

She portrays slave society as a culture that developed its own healing methods while subject to abuse and racist theories from white medical practitioners. Slave healthcare was an amalgam of various African tribal traditions transmuted by their dispersal throughout the South. Important to these systems were such factors as kinship relations in the community and the role of slave women in healing practices. White medical care of slaves concentrated on their fitness for labor in the household or fields. Written in a lively and engaging style, this book is a unique overview of the complex interaction of white and slave medical care in the antebellum South. Fett, who is currently a visiting scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, also provides an important background to African American health since the end of slavery.

Thomas friend, Gule, is the one obsessed with Lole, a married woman with whom he had a tumultuous, intense affair some time back, and though the novel is named after her, each of the five young men has a highly developed story of his own full of equal passions. One of the great strengths of this novel, which is about many things love, death, lust, male friendship, growing up, lost youth, lies, crime, nature is the way young Latino manhood is portrayed so organically here, as a natural backdrop, a fact of life, rather than in a heavy-handed or didactic way. In fact, I might go so far as to say that Palma s failure to use his characters cultural background as a more overt marketing tool may be part of why this novel wasn t snatched up by corporate New York, but that in my opinion this is to the novel s credit rather than its detriment. This is not a novel of the (make-believe) post-racial America we ve heard so much about of late, but likewise it is not a novel of the racially obsessed 1970s-1990s America either. There is a racial/cultural ease and sophistication here that, ironically, belongs predominantly to the young, like Palma, who simply have come of age in a different era, and who juggle the multiplicity of identity without either trying too hard or breaking a sweat.

(See the Read-alikes column on Judas that appeared in the December 1, 2007, issue of Booklist.) But this particularly readable attempt to tell Judas’ story in the form of a historical novel is notable for its imaginative use of biblical incidents to give readers a different way to think about the Bible’s biggest villain. Here Judas is the illegitimate child of a Jewish woman and a Roman soldier. His mother is eventually reduced to prostitution, and Judas grows up among thieves and whores. His thirst for revenge against those who abused his mother and young sister leads Judas to some bad places but eventually to Jesus, where his apostolic role is not what he supposes. If there’s any complaint to be made about the book, it’s that it’s too short, especially at the end, where readers will want to hear more about the familiar cast of characters. Ramsay’s observations about the roles of women in biblical society make the novel a good choice for book clubs. --Ilene Cooper", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With its completion, she began to think seriously about publishing. Unable to bear the thought of, not only the rejection of her work, but the possibility of having it chopped up, she felt her only real option was to self publish.

In Promiscuous Eating, Dr. Andrew Siegel brilliantly and passionately illuminates why so many of us continue to struggle with weight issues, even though we know the dangers to our health. We are simply not mindful or disciplined eaters. Dr. Siegel's candor regarding the toxic foods we ingest every day is nothing short of startlingly. It is clear, from this most timely book, that there is no magic bullet in achieving a healthy body. But we should not despair.  Dr. Siegel empowers us with a detailed `road map' to healthy and enjoyable eating. I particularly sparked to the importance of learning to identify the difference between hunger on an emotional basis and hunger on a physical basis. This concept gave me pause - like so many of us who are overweight, I overindulge for the very reasons Dr. Siegel espouses: stress, fatigue, boredom and the need for immediate gratification - all emotional states that I learned in Promiscuous Eating can be soothed with a plethora of alternate activities, including exercise (and even a `warm bath.' ) Although I hate to exercise, reading Promiscuous Eating (together with Dr. Siegel's first book, Finding Your Own Fountain of Youth: The Essential Guide to Maximizing Health, Wellness, Fitness and Longevity) has finally convinced me that exercise is essential to a healthy mind and body.  Promiscuous Eating also provides us with a rare glimpse into the intimate eating habits of several individuals - why they eat, where they eat and what they eat. Dr. Siegel draws the curtain back and thoughtfully and non-judgmentally reveals our universal compulsion to overeat and in so doing allows us to better understand the drivers for our destructive eating habits-- habits that will contribute to heart disease, cancer and diabetes among other illnesses and, ultimately, a premature death. The message telegraphed in this life saving book is `loud and clear' -- we need to take control of our destructive eating now. Promiscuous Eating will enlighten you and most importantly inspire you to love and care for yourself enough to immediately begin the very personal journey to achieving a healthier relationship with food.  I am grateful to Dr. Siegel for caring so deeply about `our collective health and well being' that he takes time from his busy medical practice to write wellness books that will, no doubt, lead us to longer, happier lives. --F. Kane (Los Angeles, CA, USA)A wonderful, much needed, highly readable and informative book. Everyone can relate to it, if even in secret with just him or her self admitting to these behaviors. This last year I have been obsessed with food due to a problem of insulinoma. It is indeed carbs that do all kinds of bad stuff. I eat only healthly carbs, such as fruit and whole grains and have gained a lot of weight. Luckily I was thin at the start. The good news is that the high insulin, low blood sugar has just about returned to normal this last month so I am very excited to return to normal eating, using your book as a quide. This is an important book to have for anyone dealing with body or food issues, overweight or not and just wanting to have a healthier lifestyle. --V. Conyers (San Francisco, CA, USA)Phenomenal...a life changer! It really hit home with a lot of issues that people deal with everyday, myself included, but don't want to talk about. I really love how the author put actual quotes from real people in there. I keep the book with me at all times for motivation because I recently broke my bad food habits back in January and am now working out five days a week and playing racquetball twice a week. So once again I say THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, Dr. Siegel!!!!! --Aaiah Brown (Raleigh, NC, USA)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Every restaurant in Lisbon served incredible plates that changed my gastronomic education forever. After visiting, I also realized that this is one of the hilliest cities in Portugal, very similar to the hills in Porto. As far as nightlife, Barrio Alto is an incredible place to go out and has something for everyone. You can't go to Lisbon and not go to Pasteis de Belem. Try their infamous pastries and amazing coffee. Dieters beware of the temptation in Portugal!The architecture in Lisbon is very striking. So many distinctive cultures have existed here before, and have left their marks on the buildings, roads, and monuments that still stand today. The mix of vivid colors with the modern tram system flying through the streets was especially memorable. Another must-see is the BaiucaFado House- an entertaining place featuring the typical music of Portugal. The owner is a real testament to loving one's job.Overall, it is very easy to get around on foot in Lisbon, making it a pedestrian's dream come true. If you must leave the center of the city, you can take the metro, or grab a taxi. Lisbon is situated right smack in the center of Portugal, making it a short distance from surrounding areas features in this issue. I recommend renting a car if you have the opportunity so that you can escape the bustling city and enjoy the nearby towns where you will catch some beautiful scenery and have your taste buds explode. Whether it is architecture, nightlife, attractions or food, Lisbon proves to offer the very best of it all!David Hoffmann, Davidsbeenhere.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For the record: Charles is a 200-year-old ghost - a sexy one at that - and California mystery writer Katherine is his cohort. Charles has special powers for a ghost; he can time travel, take over bodies, and either heal or harm.He's a reformed ghost now interested in doing right - and his brother has drawn him into the world of mass murder and redemption, a mission that will challenge and change his purposes...Complicating his purposes is Katherine, his worldly lover, whose husband has just died... From the Middle East and politics to lessons learned in the Afterlife about heaven and hell, Charles and Katherine's romance blossoms and reveals more insights on the nature of being (\"With the help of Dante's imaginative work, the Catholic Church sold Hell as a piece of real estate to its adherents. I've searched high and low for Hell. I went to the center of the earth and found it hot, but no devil. I toured around the universe and found only outer space.\")What makes THE SORCERER'S PROMISE stand out from the crowd is an attention to romance, interpersonal interaction, and a focus on healing rifts and bettering the universe - all packaged in the moving story of a ghost searching for meaning and purpose in both good and evil forces.Add poetic language and Katherine's evolution from a corporal entity to Charles' companion and you have a fine, riveting read recommended for fantasy and romance enthusiasts alike!Diane C.

Anything technical or crazy comes from Steve’s education in psychology and his work experience as a systems analyst. The romance is mostly him too, to which Traci and a few old (as in former) girlfriends will attest.  This is their first romantic comedy. Other work includes two young adult adventure books in the Mark of Kain series and a fantasy for all ages entitled The Dragon Princess. Steve and Traci are working on their fourth decade of marriage, are the proud parents of two exceptional daughters, and are grandparents to two of the brightest and best looking grandsons in the world. When Traci isn’t watching the San Diego Padres and Steve has found his way back home from hiking in the hills, they can sometimes be found on Facebook (as the only two-faced Lynn Evans) or updating their webpage (http://2blynnevans.com).

LELAND P. STEWART grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he obtained two Bachelor of Science degrees - one in mathematics and the other in mechanical engineering. While working as a test engineer for the General Electric Company and planning to study further at the Harvard Business School in preparation for administrative work in industry, he suddenly came to the realization that his life was to be headed in another direction. Leland Stewart then applied and was accepted at the Harvard Divinity School, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Theology degree in 1953. He was ordained by the Universalist Church of America at Little Falls, New York, in 1954. During his time in industry he wrote a book now entitled From Technological Power to Lasting Peace, which outlined his thinking along general and philosophical lines. During the time he spent at Harvard Divinity School, he worked on a 400-page compilation of the scriptures of the world's living religions and modern inspirational writings called World Scriptures. This book was published in 2003. Volume Two is an extension of this work as a separate volume focused on guiding principles for living in the emerging global civilization. Since his entry into the life of world spiritual and community leadership, Rev. Stewart has served, and continues to serve, as Founder and Central Coordinator of the Unity-and-Diversity World Council (UDC), bringing high energy to the practice of universal cooperative co-existence. The Council began during 1965, when the General Assembly of the United Nations declared International Cooperation Year. The Council has its headquarters in Los Angeles. Rev. Stewart is also the Founding Minister and Director of Ministry Training of the Unity-and-Diversity World Fellowship, a specialized affiliate of Unity-and-Diversity World Council, Inc.

York looks at writing like an all-you-can-eat buffet: she has to try a little bit of everything. She has written business and technical non-fiction, erotica, action-adventure, SF, fantasy, romance, YA, and various combinations of all of the above. She has always loved words, in every form. Her first foray into publishing, as the ten-year-old reporter, editor and publisher of a one-page neighborhood newspaper, lasted only a few weeks. During the enforced retirement that followed, she finished grade school, high school, and college, married, had a couple kids, divorced, re-married, and eventually found her way back to writing. An Oregon native, Christina has always lived on the West Coast. After growing up in the suburbs of L.A., she spent many years in and around Seattle, moved to Eugene, Oregon, and eventually settled on the rugged Oregon coast, where she can see the ocean from her office window. She shares her home with her husband, writer J. Steven York, and a couple of very spoiled cats. She is currently at work on a mystery for Berkley Prime Crime (MURDER BUYS A T-SHIRT) and another for Tsunami Ridge Publishing (STRUNG UP). She can be found on Facebook (Christina York), Twitter (@christinafyork and @christymystery), Webpage www.YorkWriters.com, and on her mystery blog (http://www.christymystery.com/).", "related": ["B007VP627W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

YUZUK was born in Brooklyn, New York. He worked in sales and sales management before returning to college as a freshman at age 40.    In 1987, he began working as a New York City Substance Abuse Prevention Counselor. First at Kings County Hospital and then for the SPARK Program at Canarsie and Franklin K. Lane High Schools.    After he retired, his full-time police officer/actor son David said, “Hey Pops, why don’t you write a screenplay for me.” He wrote a police procedural called, The Devil’s Troll. He then teamed up with David to collaborate on their first screenplay The Reluctant Knight. That screenplay eventually became the first book in the Beachside PD series—Beachside PD: The Reluctant Knight— and it was a Global eBook Awards finalist in the category of Suspense/Thriller.    Since then, he’s co-authored the newly published Beachside PD: The Gypsy Hunter.  David is now working on a Beachside PD prequel, Beachside PD: Cities of Sand and Stone (scheduled for June, 2012), while Neil is working on the fourth book in the series, Beachside PD: Undercover (scheduled for December, 2012).    DAVID A. YUZUK was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and he always enjoyed being involved in athletics. He played high school and college football and has studied the martial arts. Leaving Brooklyn, he moved to South Florida where he has been working as a Police Officer for the last fourteen years. On his days off, he works on his various creative projects—writing, acting, and film-making.    As part-time actor David Danello, he has had speaking roles on TV shows like Burn Notice, The Glades, and America's Most Wanted. His movie roles include Miami Vice, U.S.S. Seaviper, I Love Miami, and 5th of a Degree.     David's passion for writing started with screenplays and he has IMDB credit as a co-writer of the film 5th of a Degree. He then teamed up with his father Neil Yuzuk to collaborate on their first screenplay The Reluctant Knight, which eventually became the novel, Beachside PD: The Reluctant Knight.     David has also written the illustrated children's book The Legend of the Smiling Chihuahua (www.smilinglegend.com).

The transition from mail-order wives to feminist writings, including musings on female genitalia and a story accompanied by drawings of breasts in profile, is abrupt and jarring. The contents are arranged chronologically and unfortunately bereft of authorial notes that might bring some order to the chaos. SF fans may want to skip straight to the moving Nebula-winning \"Creature\" and otherwise select their own \"best of Carol Emshwiller\" from this overly comprehensive collection.

While not ignoring military history, she focuses on the Civil War as accelerating California's integration into the federal union and presents the Unitarian minister Thomas Starr King as the central figure for that process.  Matthews also draws on previously untapped records to explain how and why California gave more than any other state to the Sanitary Commission. All in all, this is a must for anyone interested in the history of either California or the Civil War.\"Robert Cherny, San Fransisco State University\"Far from the fields of battle, California and Californians nonetheless played critical roles in the coming, fighting, and meaning of the Civil War. This fine book reminds us that distance did not mean the same thing as unimportance. Glenna Matthews offers an entirely fresh vantage from which to see the war and its myriad legacies.\"William Deverell, Director, Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West\"This impressive contribution to California and Civil War history interweaves in compelling prose the complex and conflicted story of the Golden State's emergence as a fully pledged loyal state in the midst of a terrible war. Matthews's insightful and colorful volume highlights the many surprising ways that California contributed to the success of the Union Cause, despite a divided citizenry whose actions at times reflected a boldly pro-Confederate position.\"Joan Waugh, University of California, Los Angeles\"The book is a worthwhile addition; her writing flows smoothly from chapter to chapter. While she focuses on Mr King, she does not ignore other areas of interest.\"Kevin Winter, San Francisco Book Review\"Recommended.\"Choice\"... it can't be denied that in The Golden State in the Civil War we have the first truly worthwhile scholarly overview of the Civil War contributions and experiences of Californians. It is fervently hoped that Matthews's work will inspire others, as much remains to be done.\"Civil War Books\"... Glenna Matthews has written a fine addition to the literature on California during the Civil War. Her attention to the issue of racial diversity in California during the Civil War is significant, and her highlighting of the role of Thomas Starr King adds an important dimension to our understanding of the state's Civil War politics.\"John P. Lloyd, H-Net Reviews (h-net.org/reviews)\"Matthews's re-telling of a familiar story in an unfamiliar place greatly enhances our understanding of the Civil War as a nationwide conflict that remade the West alongside the North and the South.\"Stacey L.

Families zip through, stop at the occasional pull-out for a photo-op, then continue along their way. While most parks cater to motorists, one cannot experience their essence from the comfort of your driver's seat. You must walk among the trees and the mountains. Listen to wildlife all around you. Sit back, close your eyes and immerse yourself in nature. America's 58 national parks are irreplaceable treasures, yet they are our parks, preserved for our enjoyment, and if you want to experience them to their fullest you're going to need a good guide.That's where I come in. I admit my first trip to a national park was your typical affair. A group of friends drove to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We peered in, snapped a few photos, shrugged and returned to our rental car. Did we know that adventurous hikers were resting their tired legs at Phantom Ranch nearly 5,000 feet below at the canyon's floor? No. Did we know how to reach the North Rim? Probably not. The point is, we didn't know much about the Grand Canyon.I've come a long way since those first steps atop the South Rim. While researching this book I spent two full years exploring and photographing the parks, living almost exclusively in my tent. As I passed from park-to-park I learned that this was much more than an assignment; it became an awakening. It was a communion with life and land as I learned to immerse myself in nature. (I also learned how to get to the North Rim, and even hiked down to Phantom Ranch to prove to myself that people were making regular trips to the canyon floor.) I've exhaustively researched every site in this book, integrating those findings with my unique perspective and with the opinions of hundreds of park patrons and National Park Service employees.These are the footsteps you should follow, and downloading this book is the first step to an unforgettable adventure.", "related": [], "rank": 1925276, "title": "Your Guide to the National Parks of Alaska eBook", "author": "Michael Joseph Oswald", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water; but, to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life.If I had my druthers, I would write all the time. In fact, that is pretty much what I do because I have reached a point in my life where it is now possible.All my work is non-fiction. Even though I love fiction and read it voraciously, it has never been my focus and there are others who do it so much better than I.

He succeeded G. F. Mortimer as headmaster of the City of London School in 1865 at the early age of twenty-six. He retired in 1889, and devoted himself to literary and theological pursuits. Dr. Abbott's liberal inclinations in theology were prominent both in his educational views and in his books. His Shakespearian Grammar (1870) is a permanent contribution to English philology. In 1885 he published a life of Francis Bacon. His theological writings include three anonymously published religious romances - Philochristus (1878), Onesimus (1882), and Sitanus (1906).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It received that acclaim in The\nBest American Mystery Stories edited by Joyce Carol Oates.Jack\n Whyte said this about the story:This story is wonderful...\nShades of Catcher in the Rye and Summer of 42, yet with more subtle\ndrama and tragedy than either one of them. The progression from laconic,\n semi-articulate disdain to hyperbolic overkill to stark, poetic\nsimplicity is masterful and the characters are brilliant. The English\nteacher, Mr. Sanders, emerges clearly, without ever being described; the\n father is juxtaposed with Curley [from of Mice and Men] without a\ndirect connection ever being made; and the narrator s skills increasing\nexponentially as the overwhelming aura of inevitability gains momentum.Diana Gabaldon said:Not only a gripping story with an authentic\nvoice, but a marvellous technical feat, combining three separate stories\n taking place simultaneously. By turns funny, touching, and horrifying; a\n beautiful job.The following year, Michael won the same award\n with his storyBut Not Forgotten. This is what the judges said about that one...Diana Gabaldon:Moving, with a sweet twist of an ending.Jack Whyte:A wonderful story, beautifully executed.

Concise overviews are provided of all these topics. This volume is targeted at physicians interested in utilising the various percutaneous techniques available in managing back pain. … There are more than 300 illustrations, providing examples of technique and pitfalls. … This book provides an excellent overview for those already involved in image-guided spinal work or those in other interventional fields hoping to establish a service and is recommended.\" (Dr. A Saifuddin, Dr. R Hughes, RAD Magazine, September, 2005)From the reviews of the second edition:“Dr. Mathis has provided both neophytic and experienced practitioners with a comprehensive book that details the gamut of current procedures and techniques. … book is simply organized, with a logical progression of its chapters from fundamental anatomy and patient evaluation to detailed discussions of individual procedures. The diagrams are excellent and the images complement the procedural discussions. … provides both novice and experienced spine interventionalists with a superb reference. Readers will benefit from the wealth of technical information provided by Dr. Mathis and his coauthors.” (Maurice F.

He's tired of being a scholarship student at an exclusive private school, and angry after being thrown over by his so-called \"fiancee,\" Mauricette, for a bullying rich kid, Arturo. When his anger boils over, he sets a fire to his rival's mansion. Thinking that he has destroyed the entire house, Jack runs away and falls in with a gang of criminals, the leader of whom is appropriately called, The Leader. However, before he can exert an evil influence over Jack, the boy is rescued, eventually assists the police, and becomes a hero. This is a strange novel. The narrative is told mostly in the first-person, present tense, but readers never come to know Jack very well. His downfall and his recovery come too quickly, and the entire business about his love life is simply bizarre. (Jack is inspired to commit arson after attending an engagement party for preadolescent Mauricette and Arturo.) Charyn achieves a mysterious overall tone, and conveys a certain surreal quality, but young people are likely to find this story baffling. --Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, ILCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0090MXTVG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.7143, "rating_total": 52.0}

It didn’t matter if the stories were true or not.  Those legends set fire to my imagination, creating images that emerged slowly over the years, finally igniting as my short stories and novels.   Now, thirty-plus short stories and three novels later, ideas keep coming, with novel number four well underway.  Do they share anything in common?  Each has its own unique voice and tale to tell, some in the old style and some in the flavors of Chunky Monkey and Marshmallow-Cherry swirl.  Yet, at their heart, my stories tell a tale of the human condition – the good, the bad and the ugly. My literary roots, planted in the American Midwest, thrived when transplanted – over thirty-nine years ago – to the rich, cultural soil of Ontario.  Warmed by a Florida sun, I now divide my winters between Kitchener, Ontario and Port St. Lucie, Florida.  Those roots have grown to become the life I’ve always dreamed of having: writer, dreamer and storyteller.

The ghosts--the women featured in the album--whisper in Susan's ear, titillate her with gossip about their love lives and literally seduce her. A confused 30-year-old with a bunch of advanced degrees and little desire to use them, Susan becomes swept up in the lives of her spiritual predecessors and sets out to understand their history. Her quest is complicated by a rocky relationship with her lover, Catherine, who is bothered by Susan's obsession with the ghosts. Martinac, whose writing appeared in Voyages Out 1: Lesbian Short Fiction , has a passion for the remnants of yesteryear; she excels at descriptions of antiques stores, 1920s nostalgia and the experiences of maverick women of those times. Less successful is her depiction of contemporary romance, which is weighed down by the kind of solemn analysis that engages only the people in the relationship. Susan's romance with the past, however, and the lessons she learns from her ghosts, ought to satisfy readers interested in lesbian social history.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Toasa, the head of the family, tells stories of lions and ghosts and poignantly describes his peoples' connection to their land. He asserts that \"his one inconsolable regret was the fact that Tauilopepe, the son of his friend, of the man he had loved so much, would be responsible for the final destruction of his world.\" The Samoans are envious of the papalagi (European whites) but strive to better their own circumstances, unlike the characters in Alan Duff's Once Were Warriors (LJ 6/15/94). Tauilopepe tames the bush to create a plantation and acquire considerable personal wealth. As he gains stature in his community, he loses the love and respect of his family. Following his success, Tauliopepe is described by his son as being like \"all preachers in their wooden thrones who do not listen to their own message because their hearts are stone.\" For general readers with an interest in Pacific literature.Kimberly G.

With this bloodline of writers, and being named after Bret Harte from his western short stories, it was inevitable his imagination would find its way into print.  The Half-Breed Gunslinger and Hunter James Dolin: The Half-Breed Gunslinger – Book II, the first two books of this \"Cracker Western\" series, as Bret calls them, are available in ebook and print at major online book retailers. Hunter James Dolin is a gunslinger in Florida during the early 1860s when cattle roam the free range and the only justice is meted out by the fastest gun. Many other adventures are soon to be unleashed from this exciting storyteller's mind in various genres, including Fantasy and the Paranormal. Be sure to watch for more titles from Bret Lee Hart coming soon from Western Trail Blazer and Publishing by Rebecca J.

He works in the Kierkegaard Research Center as a translator and suffers from Asperger's. When his boss (and former fiancée) is murdered soon after the discovery of a new Kierkegaard manuscript--a collection of poetry believed by some to be a forgery--Daniel is a prime suspect. His condition makes it difficult for him to tolerate changes to his routine or interpret people's behavior, but he is drawn into the mystery despite himself and must work with the police to uncover the truth. Satterlee clearly is familiar with Copenhagen and Kierkegaard, and this knowledge grounds the story and lends it realism. This is a deftly crafted mystery that will leave readers curious and surprised, as well as empathetic to Daniel, whose Asperger's is portrayed realistically. -Publishers Weekly(Reviewed on 04/22/2013)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

In 1983 Oreste returned to school for a post-doctoral degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. Subsequently, he directed two Marriage and Family Centers, Allegra Counseling Centers that were successful. He continued to teach for about ten years during this time.

Dr. Rondinella has traveled extensively in the last twenty-five years and conducted research and interviews that contributed to his books.

I think my main reason for interest in that field was as a way of proving to my father I could make a living watching television. I am now totally retired from all forms of work, with the exception of those small requirements my wife now inflicts on me—tasks preformed for little or no pay, I might add. My lovely and gentle wife added to this blend of joy and frustration by acquiring an attack dog for home security. Very few people have the slightest conception of the sense of failure a former Marine achieves as he walks behind a six pound miniature Yorkshire Terrier, appropriately named Trouble. With the profits from my book sales, I hope to be able to afford a “pooper scooper.”", "related": ["B00CY6YZ0E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

People becoming lethargic, falling into sudden comas. Scary stuff. If there was still a containment zone, it wasn't being talked about. The thing had obviously long broken free and was loose in the wild frontier.That night the president interrupted the regular scheduled programming to deliver a live televised address to the nation regarding the outbreak. This was the first time the government admitted there was a serious problem. Still, the president reassured everyone they had it under control. No need to panic. Go about your daily lives.And may God bless America.March 14, 2012.Officer Robinson hadn't called or visited the store in a few days. I wondered if he was glued to the TV like me. I felt more alone, afraid to leave the store. I finally told grandma about the news reports that had been coming in on a semi-regular basis. She seemed less worried than me.March 15, 2012.Tens of thousands of people were now believed to be sick with the virus. Falling asleep on the job had become a wide spread epidemic, sweeping across the west coast and as far east as Mississippi. Overhead shots of cars idling on highways, passengers inside them, sleeping. The Las Vegas strip was littered with bodies lying motionless on the ground, while high above the flashy casino signs continued to flicker with color and life. Airports and other transportation services were forced to shut down after a number of planes fell out of the sky, some on top of residential neighborhoods. Hospitals, police stations, and other public places were overrun with concerned citizens. And church had become popular again.I decided I wasn't going to leave the store until this thing worked itself out.March 16, 2012.Second national televised address by the president. The fake looking background immediately gave it away that he was no longer in the White House. He said to avoid travel if possible. He said not to be alarmed. He said that the CDC was close to having a vaccine. He said that because we are Americans we could get through anything. He said nothing of the most recent reports that over fifty percent of the residents of Nevada, California, and Arizona had become infected. Fallen into a deep slumber.March 17, 2012.First reports of the virus crossing national borders. Canada. Mexico. China. Australia. Japan. Great Britain. France. Germany. Brazil. Any country popular with businessmen or tourists began to experience the virus firsthand, thus all flights out of North America, South America, Europe, and much of Asia were suspended indefinitely. On the home front, the virus had made its way to all fifty states, including Alaska and Hawaii. There were massive power outages. Protests turned into violent riots on the street. Looters had their way with defenseless businesses. From coast to coast, cities burned as unrest among those not infected grew out of control. Systematic bombings of entire regions became a common occurrence, as the last remnants of the government and its reduced military tried any and all methods to slow the inevitable death of civilization.Unsuccessfully.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 56, "rating_average": 4.125, "rating_total": 231.0}

I even went to Bar school at the Inns of Court in London and, even more improbably, passed. It was a last desperate fling of the student life I was reluctant to leave behind. Later, I moved to Spain with the idea of spending a year teaching English. I never left and have spent more than twenty years living here, the last fifteen or so in Seville. I share my home with two cats: an evil, cross-eyed Siamese and jet black one that behaves like a dog. I work as the director of a large language school but in my free time I like working with my hands: cooking, carpentry, sewing, drawing and model making. I enjoy good food and red wine and whiling away the afternoon on a terraza yarning to my friends.

With eager anticipation she drives her average car to her average home, and eats her average (vegetarian and completely healthy!) meal alone. The minutes tick by, and when the sun finally sets she leaps tall sofas in a single bound, shedding her disguise to take on her true super heroine persona! Is she in such a rush to save the world? Save the city? Save the neighbor’s kitten from a tree? No!

There are lonely werewolves searching desperately for mates, spoiled rich boys just waiting for her gentle caress of the keyboard to create someone who’ll truly understand them, and futuristic soldiers, gunning across the universe to save the men they love… No scenario is too bizarre! A time traveling pirate? No problem! Violin playing specter haunting a Scottish castle? You betcha!

Drosophila, a highly versatile model with a genetic legacy of more than a century, provides powerful genetic, cellular, biochemical and molecular biology tools to address many questions extending from basic biology to human diseases.  One of the most important questions in biology focuses on: how does a multi-cellular organism develop from a single-celled embryo? The discovery of the genes responsible for pattern formation has helped refine this question.  Drosophila eye model has been extensively used to study molecular genetic mechanisms involved in patterning and growth. Since the genetic machinery involved in the Drosophila eye is similar to humans, it has been used to model human diseases and homology to eyes in other taxa. This book will discuss molecular genetic mechanisms of pattern formation, axial patterning, growth regulation in Drosophila eye, and more.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "Madhuri Kango-Singh", "author": "Amit Singh", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was impossible to put it down, but I hated getting to the last page and leaving my friends behind. Lea's Gift would be a perfect Hallmark Special Christmas tradition to watch year after year after year. I cried, I laughed, and I cheered and booed as the story unfolded. I highly recommend this book to everyone; it is a beautiful reminder of how we should treat each other, what is really important on this earth and just a lovely story. I give this book a five star plus, plus, plus rating. I urge you to read Lea's Gift; you will not be disappointed.  -- Reviewed by Trudi LoPreto for Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

How can the international community be wiser and more successful in preventing war and creating peace after conflict? It should be required reading by all who aspire to act to suppress conflict and build sustainable peace\"   - Lord Paddy Ashdown, former High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina\"The 1995 Dayton Accords silenced the guns of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also put in place an international administration that during the past few years has become unworkable. This book is an insiders' account of how the Dayton process unraveled. The author also uses his Bosnia experience to provide an incisive analysis of \"non-violent wars\" and the important lessons to be learnt from it. It is essential reading for all interested in the recent history of the Balkans and more generally in post-violence politics.\"  -Justice Richard Goldstone, former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia\"This fascinating and essential book catalogues the vital importance of diplomacy in the world today. Philippe Leroux-Martin gives us an insider's view of how Bosnia was put back together after the war.\"  - Nicholas Burns, Harvard University\"The vicious ethnic conflicts that tore Yugoslavia apart bloodily exposed the inability of the international community to cope with an eruption of violence even in a corner of Europe. In the aftermath, the same ethnic hatreds, fueled by suspicion and duplicity, made creating a modern, civil, society out of the wreckage of war and displacement, an enormous, perhaps impossible task. Diplomatic Counterinsurgency unveils the petty politics, the behind-the-scenes confrontations and the high-stakes efforts of a handful of international advisors as Bosnians fought to re-create a nation.\" - Paul Koring, Foreign Correspondent, The Globe and Mail\"This book makes a very important contribution to our understanding of what is needed to nurture peace, stability and economic prosperity in a post-conflict environment. Drawing on the experience of Bosnia, Leroux-Martin demonstrates the interdependence of diplomacy, security and economic development in the crafting of any peace agreement and the importance of ensuring that diplomatic actors, security personnel and the international financial institutions working in the realm of economic development  work together to ensure that agreements are viable, sustainable and  deliver a visible \"peace dividend\".  \"Must reading\" for anyone engaged in fragile and conflict-affected states. \" - Christine I. Wallich, former World Bank Country Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina\"I recommend this excellent book to all who seek to understand how to take greater advantage of the interaction between diplomacy and the use of armed force.\" - General Sir Rupert Smith, author of The Utility of Force\" If you set about to lead a crisis management mission where state building and strengthening the rule of law are among your key tasks, make sure you read this book first.\" - Pieter Feith, former International Civilian Representative and European Union Special Representative for KosovoIn his brilliant analysis of how crisis management in Bosnia and Herzegovina went off the rails, Philippe Leroux-Martin turns Clausewitz's famous dictum that \"war is a continuation of politics by other means\" on its head.  Leroux-Martin concludes that the capacity of international interveners to counter \"non-violent wars\" through diplomatic means is almost inevitably limited, and he offers a compelling alternative strategy to steer conflict.  Diplomatic Counterinsurgency should be required reading for diplomats and other international crisis managers.\"  -Michael Haltzel, Senior Fellow, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and former advisor to U.S. Vice President (then-Senator) Joseph R.

Her mother and father separated when she was young. She lived with her mother who later remarried a wonderful man, who had a huge impact on her as she grew up. Angee has always had a love of reading, mostly paranormal. As a child, she would sneak up at late night when her mom thought she was sleeping, to read. They moved around a lot, eventually settling in Deep East Texas. Angee married at a young age and eventually divorced. She has raised her now 15 year old son alone. Angee works full time as a pre-hospital nurse and sometimes sees things that would make the rest of us have nightmares. On other days, she is blessed to see miracles. These things are what drive her to write. Angee describes her job as- \"I fight to save people's lives. Sometimes I lose, sometimes I win. It's the emotional roller coaster of that job, which leads me to writing. I'm able to put those emotions into my characters and let them out of my heart and soul.\" In 2006, she was diagnosed with a rare disease, shortly after that she was told she would be on full disability in five years and most likely to be dead in ten. She's fought to live a normal life every day since and is beating those odds. She works at a demanding job, is a single mom, cares for an elderly mother, and a hyperactive dog. Her life has inspired her Paranormal novel Hidden Secrets. Sit back and enjoy.

Ethan and Emma are twins. One day their mother finds out that they have diaper rash. Now to apply the ointment, their mother invents a story about the ointment. Isabel the ointment does her magic work on the twins and soon they find themselves fully cured of the rash. Isabel the ointment, flies to different places - Turkey, Mongolia, Argentina, Spain, Hungary, England, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico and Greece - and spreads her magic everywhere. Parents get relief from the recurring problem of diaper rash in their kids.The book is highly imaginary and creative. It is a story that children will enjoy reading again and again. Isabel the ointment has been portrayed like a fairy and with her magic wand she performs magiconchildren. The illustrations are as enchanting as the story. They are lively and colorful and give movement to the story. The illustration of Isabel the ointment gives her a personality of her own as she touches children and creates magic.The book is perfect for bedtime story telling. The colors, the pictures, and the characters of Emma and Ethan will weave a kind of magic in tiny minds. It will influence their creative thinking to a large extent. It is also ideal for read-aloud sessions in classrooms and libraries. The illustrations are absolutely magical and highlight the whimsical theme, taking the story to another level. Children will love usingointmentfor their diaper rash after reading this story book. An absolutely delightful read. I salute the author and illustrator for their creative thoughts and ideas and putting it down in this story.

She attended Parochial Schools in Pittsburgh from 1953-1965, attending St. Kieran Elem.School and St. Paul Cathedral H.S.with an emphasis in Business, graduating in 1965. She worked as a secretary in a real estate office and in an address-o-graph company working her way through college. During that time, she attended non-degree evening classes in Painting and Drawing at Carnegie Institute of Technology, her first exposure to the world of ART. She attended Edinboro State Teachers College of PA, earning a Bachelor of Science Degree in Art Education in 1970.Accepting her first teaching contract in 1970, she worked as a Pittsburgh Public School Art Teacher while earning a Master Equivalency Degree in Education from Penn State University Extension Campus and the University of Pittsburgh External Studies. In 1974, she married Robert Gallagher, a Pennsylvania State Police Officer, known to most as just 'Gallagher'. They have two daughters. In 1978, she elected to become a stay-at-home mom, but she also worked as a substitute teacher in the Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg, and the Woodland Hills School Districts. In 1985, she accepted a contract again with Pittsburgh and worked as an Elementary Art and Computer Education teacher at the Brookline Elementary Teachers Center. In 1991, she transferred to a position at McKelvy, Spring Garden, and Mifflin Elementary schools. In 2001, she took a medical sabbatical after becoming ill with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Disabled at age fifty-four, she accepted a disability pension in 2002, never returning to the classroom.She began writing in 2007 as an attempt to regain the mental acuity she had lost due to her illness. Over the years, she has become a self-published author by educating herself in every aspect of the process. She has published several editions of her manuscripts in both eBooks and Paper using the pen name, 'CLU GALLAGHER' as well as her given name with her pen name, 'Maura/Clu Gallagher' or most recently, 'Maura Gallagher'. A new diagnosis, confirming the condition she was probably born with but had never been diagnosed, Hypothyroidism, has provided new medications and a renewed sense of hope for her future: \"I have not written my best novel yet. It is on my bucket list.\"Since her first self-pub in 2010, Maura has published her first two manuscripts in 10 editions.

A co-worker of mine had gotten me started me on the 50 Shades Trilogy. I had quickly became absorbed! Reading contemporary romance had become apart of me. Little did I know that my daughter was a product of the \"50 Shades Baby Boom\"! I remember going to my doctor's appointment to find out that we were off to labor and delivery- and I didn't download any new books to my kindle! Talk about bummed out! However, I made up for that when I was home for my maternity leave. I believe we read 40+ books while I was home. I am a full time new mom, and wife. Yes, I do work full time, I am currently doing multiple things, bouncing back after baby, weight watchers, exercising, training for a 5k, reading and writing. So far, I have really enjoyed writing as a hobby. My work book club, \"HE\" had consumed us (and by us, I mean 2). We were critics of the stories and characters. I then thought to myself, \"hmm, I bet I could write stories just like this, and have them turn out like I'd want them to.\" Well, joking turned into thinking. Thinking turned into brainstorming. Brainstorming lead to opening a word document and letting my mind explore. Growing up I had written short stories with friends, and as extra credit for school. This is probably where it all started... I had turned in one of my short stories without re-reading, or editing it completely. I had my paper returned to me saying the \"content was inappropriate.\" Apparently contemporary romance was frowned upon in English class! Oops! So maybe I was destined to become a writer.", "related": ["B00JYFN3GA"], "rank": 419923, "title": "Burning Desire (Condemned Angels MC Series #1)", "author": "Heather Leigh", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 51, "rating_average": 4.2549, "rating_total": 217.0}

Usually Clayton write works around sports to learn more about influential athletes in the hopes that from his writing, you the reader can walk away inspired to put in an equal if not greater amount of hard work and perseverance to pursue your goals. If you are a sports junkie like Clayton, you can read his sports-related works including Steve Nash: The Inspiring Story of One of Basketball's Greatest Point Guards and Stephen Curry: The Incredible Story of One of Basketball's Sharpest Shooters in the Kindle Store.

And if you're anticipating confusion from this time-traveling setting, think again: one of the attributes of The Bed is its uncommon ability to wheel through scenes of time changes with little interruption of plot, character, or setting. Diane Donovan, eBook reviewer Midwest Book Reviews.--Vlachos' concept and execution prove as sturdy as the beautiful, restored antique bed that Joe presents to Sara as a wedding gift. Vlachos not only has a fine sense of down-to-earth humor and irony, but he also has mastered the subtle technique of character-as-plot - and the art of using dialogue to advance both. His text avoids cliches while holding a mirror up to life - not just Joe and Sara's, but ours, too.  Eric Marchese, Orange County Register--Some of life's most intimate and revealing moments take place in the bedroom. That's certainly true for Chicago couple Joe and Sara Isaia. The Bed is the story of their life together, starting on their wedding night in 1983 and ending 60 years later in their old age. The bed itself is a restored antique, Joe's wedding gift to Sara, the one constant in their lives. It symbolizes the durability of their relationship. The Bed creaks and sags, even groans, at times, but it never completely gives way.  Goodkindles-Where Writers Meet Readers", "related": ["B00KO44KJO"], "rank": 9794, "title": "The Bed: When all else fails laugh.
