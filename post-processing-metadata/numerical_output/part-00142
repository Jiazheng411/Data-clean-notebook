Crystal Vasicek was the proprietor of the popular little café and the creator of the most amazingly decadent desserts in all of West Virginia— and probably the other forty-nine states, too.Jewel waited for the grinder to shut off before she spoke. \"It's your fault, you know.\"Crystal dumped the grounds into the waiting basket and slid it into place, then punched the button to start the coffee brewing before she turned. \"That's quite an accusation coming from the woman who's always so quick to assume responsibility for everyone else's troubles.\" Her pretty blue eyes sparkled with a combination of amusement and curiosity.\"What did I do?\"\"It's what you didn't do,\" Jewel told her.\"Okay—\" Crystal picked up a pot of coffee that had finished brewing and poured her sister a cup \"—whatdidn'tI do?\"\"Marry Russ.\"Crystal raised a perfectly arched eyebrow. \"He never asked.\"\"He might have.\" Jewel dumped a heaping spoonful of sugar into her cup. \"If you hadn't run off and married Simon.\"\"Forgive me for falling in love and not anticipating how that event might somehow interfere with your plans.\"\"You always were the type to leap without looking.\"\"And you always exercised enough caution for both of us,\" Crystal replied evenly.Because she'd wanted to protect her sister, to shield her from the expectations—and the disappointments—that were inherent in being a daughter of Jack Callahan. After all, she'd had half a dozen years of experience with that before Crystal came along.\"We were talking about Russ,\" Jewel reminded her.\"What about Russ?\"\"He's leaving.\"\"Oh.\"There was a wealth of understanding in that single syllable.Jewel's throat was suddenly tight, making it difficult for her to speak. And what more could she say, anyway?Crystal went to the bakery display and pulled out a mile-high chocolate cake, then cut a thick wedge and put it on a plate with a fork. Jewel managed a smile as her sister nudged it across the counter toward her. Crystal believed that chocolate was a cure-all for every one of life's problems, and judging by the seven layers of moist cake and creamy icing she'd just set in front of Jewel, she understood the magnitude of this one.Russ Granger had worked at the Callahan Thoroughbred Center for the last ten years, but he'd been Jewel's friend a lot longer than that, and she couldn't help but be shocked by his defection. He wasn't just leaving his job—he was leaving her. He was the only man she'd ever felt she could truly count on, and now he was moving on.After pouring herself a cup of coffee, Crystal came around to sit next to her sister at the counter. \"Why is he leaving?\"Jewel picked up the fork and dipped the tines into the decadent dark icing. \"Because Riley got some big recording contract and he wants to go on tour with her.\"\"She was wasting her talent singing at The Mustang,\" Crystal said gently.Jewel popped a bite of cake into her mouth, but even the rich flavor didn't lift her spirits. \"I should have guessed something like this would happen,\" she admitted. \"As soon as he told me he was going to propose to Riley, I should have known. But I was so happy for him that I didn't think about what it might mean for CTC. I certainly didn't think he'd take off in the middle of the season.\"\"He's leaving soon, then?\"\"The end of next week. He's been working closely with Darrell over the past several years and assured me that he's more than ready to take over his duties, but—\" she sighed and dug into the cake again \"—I can't imagine how I'll get through the season without him.\"\"You will,\" Crystal said confidently. \"Because there isn't anything you can't do if you put your mind to it.\"Jewel had always prided herself on being capable and independent, able to handle anything and everything on her own. And it was a good thing, too, because that was how she always ended up—on her own.\"Jack Callahan might have built CTC, but the only reason it's one of the top training facilities in the state today is because of you,\" Crystal said, then smiled wryly. \"And in spite of me. Lord knows, I never had any interest in staying on the farm or working with the horses.\"\"You carved your own path.\" Jewel was proud of her sister's success, and she still got a kick out of the fact that Crystal's spectacular desserts were available not just at the little café where she'd first started baking but in some of the area's trendiest and most exclusive restaurants. \"Sometimes I wonder why I couldn't have wanted something else more than I wanted the farm.\"\"You were a champion barrel racer for three years running,\" Crystal reminded her.She smiled, though her memories of that time in her life were more bitter than sweet. \"That was a lifetime ago.\"\"It was what inspired me to do my own thing, regardless of what Jack wanted.\"\"I would have done anything he wanted,\" Jewel admitted. Even now, she wasn't sure why she'd always tried so hard to please him, she only knew that she'd never succeeded. Nothing she'd ever done was good enough for Jack Callahan.\"And did,\" her sister reminded her. \"Including giving up your own life to come home when he asked you to.\"He hadn't really asked but demanded, as both sisters knew was his way. But the truth was, six years on the rodeo circuit had disillusioned Jewel about a lot of things, and she'd been more than ready to return to Alliston, West Virginia. Her father's heart attack had been both her incentive and her excuse to finally do so and, her difficulties with him aside, she hadn't ever regretted that decision.She had become his willing assistant, as eager to learn as she was to demonstrate what she already knew, confident that he would learn to trust in her abilities and eventually grant her more authority. But Jack Callahan had continued to hold the reins of the business in his tightly clenched fist until—many years later—they'd finally been pried from his cold, dead fingers.Jewel and Crystal had stood side by side at his funeral, his daughters from two separate marriages, both sisters painfully aware that they'd been neither wanted nor loved by their father. And more than they'd mourned his death, they'd mourned the distance between them that he'd never tried to breach.\"My life was always here,\" Jewel finally responded to her sister's comment. \"Even when I thought it wasn't.\"Crystal touched a hand to her arm. \"Maybe the problem isn't that Russ is leaving, but that he found someone and you haven't.\"Jewel pushed the half-eaten cake away. \"Not this again.\"\"Honey, you're too young to have resigned yourself to being alone.\"\"Resigned suggests that I'm settling for less than I want, and I'm not. I'm happy with my life.\"\"You're happy being alone?\"\"I'm hardly alone.\"\"The horses don't count,\" her sister said dryly.\"At least they don't hog the bed—or the remote.\"\"Well, I can't dispute that Simon does both of those things,\" Crystal said, then a slow smile curved her lips. \"But he does other things that more than even the scales—and I'm not talking about taking out the garbage.\"Jewel got up and went around the counter to grab the coffeepot for a refill. \"You lucked out with Simon,\" she admitted.\"Then you're not really mad that I didn't wait around for Russ to propose?\"She sighed. \"How can I be mad when you're so happy?\"\"I am happy,\" Crystal said. \"Happier than I ever could have imagined.\"Jewel knew the feeling. She'd experienced that same euphoria of love—and the complete devastation of losing the man she'd thought she would love forever. She only hoped her sister would never have to know that kind of pain, that her life would always be wonderful, that Simon would always love her as much as he did now.As if following the path of her thoughts, Crystal reached out and squeezed her hand. \"Someday your prince will come.\"Before Jewel could respond, the jingle of the bell over the door announced the arrival of another customer.Crystal glanced over, then let out a low whistle.\"Don't look now,\" she told her sister. \"But I think he just walked in the door.\"Jewel picked up her cup, sipped.Crystal frowned at the lack of response.\"You told me not to look,\" Jewel reminded her.\"Since when do you listen to me?\"She shrugged. \"Since the last prince turned into a frog.\"Crystal picked up a menu and fanned herself with it. \"Six-two, I'd guess. Dark hair, darker eyes. Sinfully sexy. And—\" she glanced pointedly at her sister and smiled \"—flying solo.\"Her curiosity undeniably piqued by the description, Jewel twisted in her stool—and nearly slid right off of it and onto the floor.For once, Crystal hadn't exaggerated. The man hovering just inside the door had short, neatly cropped hair, dark slashing brows over espresso-covered eyes, a strong jaw, straight nose, slashing cheekbones and a beautifully sculpted mouth that brought to mind all kinds of wicked fantasies. His olive-toned skin and exotic looks suggested some kind of Mediterranean heritage that made her think of sultry nights and hotter passions, and the punch of lust that hit low in her belly left Jewel almost breathless.No, her sister definitely hadn't exaggerated. But what she'd neglected to include in her description was \"young.\" Way too young. Probably younger than Crystal even. Definitely too young to make a thirty-four-year-old woman weak in the knees and hot everywhere else.His gaze moved around the room and collided with hers. Then those beautiful lips slowly curved, and her heart pounded hard against her chest as if it was trying to break free in order to fall at his feet.\"Well, well, well,\" Crystal said softly.Jewel felt heat infuse her cheeks as she tore her gaze away from his hypnotic stare. Crystal smirked at her before turning her attention back to the new customer.\"Grab a seat anywhere you like,\" she called ...", "related": [], "rank": 932974, "title": "The Prince's Cowgirl Bride (Reigning Men Book 1920)", "author": "Brenda Harlen", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

L.A. private eye Joe Copp is hired by members of a dinner-theater troupe to protect its young star. Within 24 hours, Copp is shot at, beaten up by two U.S. marshals and nearly railroaded into jail on a kidnapping charge. A Minnesota judge asks Copp to find a missing son who seems to be the troupe's star. But identities are iffy, and within a short time, five cast members are brutally stabbed to death, Copp gets involved with the theater's beautiful directorand owner, whose father is presiding over the trial of a Mafia biggie; an honest cop apparently commits suicide. There's also a hint of sexual hanky-panky and drug use. None of the characters are believable, the plot moves from scene to scene with little motivation and the final wrap-up sounds as if Pendleton himself had tired of the tale.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1211549, "title": "Copp In The Dark, A Joe Copp Thriller (Joe Copp Private Eye Series Book 4)", "author": "Don Pendleton", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Focusing mostly on the fascinations and fancies of six-year-old Matilda, the tale follows her observations of the strange men who have guns and fast, shiny black cars staying at the big house next door. When she sees one of those men in a newsreel about the Russian who defected amidst controversy about the fate of his wife, she lets slip to their other neighbor, a crazy old man with his own gun, that spies live on the other side of her, leading to some action, which is in rather short supply here. A family drama evolves piecemeal in flashbacks to a beach picnic at which the father, continuing to be distraught in the aftermath of World War II, attempts to hang himself while his brother looks on immobile. While key characters are young people, even their dramas of pet parades and teenage nervous breakdowns are unlikely to interest American readers. Even incidents involving Matilda's imaginary companion are strangely flat and unappealing.

I try to write as passionate as I feel towards life. This is my first attempt at creating my view of life into words. To me life is rich with what comes out of a person's personal actions. A person illustrates to others what you harbor inside. I feel that we are all put on this earth to discover greatness, great love! To take with us into heaven the richness of everything we see and discover. So I try to do as many things, as humanly possible, to do just that - live life to its fullest. Only I have been told time and time again that I wear my heart on my sleeve. Often times I make myself late trying to help someone. An artist at heart, and extremely talented with my mind and hands, only my inner feelings so outdo my outward way in life. Animals and people mean more to me than just a name or a face. Each person is unique and has a story to tell. To watch and listen is always a treat. I could not wait to be a father and prize my children. My family was not well off, yet they showed wealth in their actions and how we interacted with each other. This makes us rich! Only motorcycles and racing has always been a passion of mine. Also to find that one true lady who I feel that God wants me to know. To meet this lady will pave the road for everyone to follow. This was also illustrated in this book. Only my next attempt will be even better. This will only be one of many books that I wish to publish. I am interested in what you as the reader may feel by reading my book and the next book will be made possible through your interest in Angel Boy. Enjoy the journey of such a rich young man who grew up and became something greater by never giving up! I have found great love, oh yes! I have found great and wonderful ladies.

Crazy hot sex is natural. It's a pure expression of myself, a way of going for second helpings of all I am. It's a way to love, to play, to heal. It's the closest I can come to another person and a foretaste of merging with the divine. It's inspiration in action, enlightenment on the physical plane. Love, sex, and intimacy dominate the meaningful parts of our lives--let's master and revel in them! Life is best when we're fully present for it, body and soul. My sincere hope is that examples of my own life and the colorful and vibrant souls I have known and loved will suggest ways in which you too will find or enhance your own brighter inner light, your own emotional spark, your own crazy hot sex.   ~~~~Adrianna Savine ~~~", "related": ["B004UJGPTM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Studiò al liceo classico di Palermo, poi si iscrisse alla facoltà di Lettere. Di qui passò nel 1887 all'università di Roma, poi a quella di Bonn dove conseguì la laurea. Al suo ritorno, volendo dedicarsi alla letteratura, si stabilì a Roma dove cominciò a collaborare con poesie e scritti critici a riviste come la \"Nuova Antologia\" e il Marzocco. Nel 1894 sposò Antonietta Portulano, dalla quale avrà tre figli. Nel '97 gli venne conferita, presso l'Istituto Superiore di Magistero, la cattedra di stilistica e poi di letteratura italiana, che terrà fino al 1925. Seguì, a partire dal 1903, un periodo difficile per lo scrittore, a causa della rovina dell'azienda paterna e con essa del patrimonio suo e della moglie.  Intanto pubblica poesie, saggi, romanzi e novelle, ma la fama gli arriva come autore drammatico. A partire dal 1922 organizza una raccolta completa delle sue novelle sotto il titolo Novelle per un anno, che allude al progetto, rimasto incompiuto, di scrivere una novella per ogni giorno dell'anno. Nel '25 Pirandello lascia l'insegnamento per dirigere il Teatro d'arte di Roma e fondare una sua compagnia. Nel '34 gli fu conferito il Nobel per la letteratura. Morì a Roma nel 1936.", "related": ["B0044R9CUY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I grew up in a small town in the Midwest; a great place where people never locked their doors and where the neighbors watched out for each other and all the children. Consequently, we had to work very hard to get into mischief without getting caught.  In my case, it was pretty easy. I was a tomboy. I fished, I hiked; I explored acres of open fields, carrying my own Red Ryder BB Gun. My real playground was the stockyards. It was a wonderful world. Horses, cattle; real cowboys who tended the livestock and who allowed me and my best friend—within reason—free run of the barns and the corrals. And so began a life-long love affair with all things cowboy. History, fiction; great movies without computer enhanced special effects; in other words, open country.  Years later, when I was working as a subcontractor for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, I had the opportunity to rekindle that love. There was nothing better than a weekend on horseback riding through places like Monument Valley, the hill country in Texas, the deserts in Arizona, the vastness of the Sioux reservation; or the same country where Billy the Kid rode, and ultimately died. I don't write history. I write western fiction; what could have been. Stories of strong men and women who survived the best and the worst the West had to offer.  All in all; it has been a great life. Especially with four kids tossed into the mix. Every day is a gift, and a surprise.

Meanwhile, Emerson’s girlfriend, Nell Reilly, threatens to leave for Seattle with their two-year-old daughter, Emily, to visit her cancer-stricken mother. Emerson was planning to drive back to Chicago the afternoon of the funeral, but decides to stick around after Lou’s sister, Meg Brodsky, asks him to investigate Lou’s death. Danger erupts after Emerson asks too many questions about Lou’s business partner, Pete Anderson, and a shady mall development that’s left many investors in hot water. Emerson becomes increasingly alarmed as clues from the past dovetail with those from the present, leading to a surprising resolution that could have used more foreshadowing.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the brutal prologue, thug Malcolm Priest murders a drug dealer who's crossed him and the drug dealer's girlfriend who has the misfortune to be on the scene. Meanwhile, Malcolm's brother-in-law, Jamie Hutchinson, is released from prison after serving time for killing 15-year-old Alan Kirkstall while driving drunk. Despite his guilty plea, Jamie has little recollection of the fatal night—which proves an obstacle to his getting past the incident and reclaiming something of his former life. When Clem Kirkstall, Alan's traumatized father, learns of Jamie's freedom, Clem vows revenge. Jamie's tentative steps toward returning to the saddle as a steeplechase jockey bring him into contact with the dead boy's sister; the surprising mutual attraction that develops is but one of a number of romantic subplots, one involving the female inspector assigned to oversee the drug-murder inquiry. The resolution may strike some readers as a little pat, especially given the gritty realism of the rest of the book, but Dick Francis fans should be delighted with the authentic picture of the horse-racing world.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He continues a tradition which stretches as far back as from Socrates and the Biblical prophets to Emile Zola and Thurgood Marshall. Dr. Tanay's voice of painful yet reflected-upon experience decries injustice in the midst of the pursuit of justice. (Harold J. Bursztajn, MD, co-founder, Program in Psychiatry and the Law at BIDMC Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School)Dr. Emanuel Tanay is a well-known forensic psychiatrist, who, having become an internationally known expert on homicide, has been called upon to testify in many high-profile cases, such as those involving Jack Ruby, Ted Bundy, Sam Sheppard, and Robert Garwood. In this book he sets out an illuminating discussion of the injustice of the American legal system.American Legal Injustice's revelations will surprise many readers and leave them with impressions never to be forgotten. It is a must read. (Ralph Slovenko, Wayne State University Law School)When I was Attorney General of Michigan from 1962 through 1998, I had the opportunity to work with and discuss numerous psychiatric issues with Dr. Emanuel Tanay. In addition to being a recognized leader in the field of psychiatry, I found Dr. Tanay to be a true scholar in other disciplines. I consider him a renaissance man. His latest book affords him the opportunity to point out the lack of fairness that occurs in our judicial system. Dr. Tanay inherently knows that our forefathers were correct when they said you must pursue justice, since it cannot be a guarantee. (Frank Kelley, Attorney General Emeritus of Michigan, 1962-1998)Every criminal justice practitioner has a professional obligation to read Dr. Tanay?s book, American Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes with an Expert Witness. From the classroom to the courtroom, whether you are a student or have already assumed arole within the American justice system, you will gain a clearer understanding of the obstacles that prevent our justice system from being effective in every type of civil or criminal action. Rarely do we have the opportunity to learn from experts withmore than 50 years of experience. Dr. Tanay presents the insider?s viewpoint?from both the prosecution and defense tables?with his honest examination of the American legal system. The courtroom is a stage; proceedings are live dramas; and the side with the best story with actors that can portray their roles most effectively will prevail. In every situation, individuals enter the courtroom unprepared and usually are subjected to a jury whose expectations have been formed by television shows. Today?s justice system does fail to exonerate some who are wrongfully accused of crimes. Dr. Tanay examines some of those situations and successfully engages the reader in his analysis of some very high profile cases. This honest examination of the justice sys (Jacqueline Fish, PhD, Charleston Southern University)Dr. Tanay's testimonial style has proven riveting and highly credible to judges and juries alike. . . . Dr. Tanay is passionate about the injustice of justice. He does not shy away from expressing his thoughts and feelings about controversial issues. The law can be a cruel and blunt instrument, when dealing with the mentally ill. Readers may strongly agree or disagree with Dr. Tanay's views, but they will be richly rewarded in encountering the heart and the mind of a great forensic psychiatrist. (From the Foreword by Robert I. Simon, MD)Every criminal justice practitioner has a professional obligation to read Dr. Tanay’s book,American Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes with an Expert Witness. From the classroom to the courtroom, whether you are a student or have already assumed a role within the American justice system, you will gain a clearer understanding of the obstacles that prevent our justice system from being effective in every type of civil or criminal action.Rarely do we have the opportunity to learn from experts with more than 50 years of experience.

Dr. Tanay examines some of those situations and successfully engages the reader in his analysis of some very high profile cases. This honest examination of the justice system from an insider’s point of view should be mandatory reading for all professionals in the criminal justice system. Whether you are in law enforcement, a prosecutor or defense attorney, a correctional staff member, a caregiver, or the family member of a victim or defendant, you will find yourself immersed in Dr. Tanay’s captivating examination of his role as an expert witness in cases across the nation spanning five decades of American history. (Jacqueline Fish, PhD, Charleston Southern University)I found this a meaty and stimulating read….I would rate this a five-star book for lawyers and much of the interested general public. In addition I would suggest its incorporation into selective areas of the post-graduate medical curriculum. (Louis C. Johnston, MD, FACP)In case descriptions, Tanay describes his observations and presents expert reports that he authored. He is a wonderful observer, thoughtfully attuned to subtleties in body movement and facial expressions of the people he has assessed. His reports are vividly written, cogent, and compelling. He has been involved in some of the most notorious criminal trials of the 20th century, including those of Jack Ruby, Ted Bundy, and Sam Sheppard....American Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes With an Expert Witnessis more personal and more idiosyncratic than any other book about expert testimony....Tanay gives us an assertive position, openly embraced and explicitly stated. This book is a valuable point of departure for experts evaluating and thinking through their own positions on expert testimony and the insanity defense.

An armed robber newly sprung from his second prison term, Baker Wyatt has used his time to plan his greatest crime yet--the kidnapping of New York City cocaine kingpin Tito Benitez in order to obtain a $3 million ransom. He recruits an old prison buddy, coke dealer Tony Ramputti, and a pickpocket, Hector Herraro. Wearing Halloween masks, the three carry out a ridiculously easy abduction of the supposedly dangerous and well-protected druglord. The ensuing demands Baker submits to Tito's wife, Felicita, are plotted just as laughably. Enter FBI Senior Agent Mark Lahey: eager to bring Tito to justice, he works with Felicita to capture the kidnappers and provides her with specially marked, sequential currency. Baker, however, has simultaneously instructed her to exchange the bills for diamonds. This development adds little suspense, serving chiefly to delay a predictable, violent finale.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The setting, the era, and time of year were all predetermined, plus the story had to be novella-length and include a wedding. Funny how many details were laid out before I even started writing!Since the story couldn't be very long, I figured the hero and heroine should probably already know each other, only not realize that they had potential to become a couple. I decided to make music the thing that connected them, because music is so evocative emotionally and spiritually. The plot then grew around all of those pieces.As for the origin of the \"June Bride\" tradition, you might think it's just about good weather (at least, in the northern hemisphere)--but May is nice here, too, and apparently, May is traditionally considered an unlucky time to marry. It seems that the popularity of marrying in June goes back to the ancient Romans, because Juno was the goddess of marriage, and the month of June was dedicated to her.", "related": ["B00502B4NA"], "rank": 1926436, "title": "A Perfect Duet", "author": "Jennifer Malin", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

Here's an example of what happens when solid, well-written information is poorly formatted. The Decades of American History series treats each 10-year period thoroughly. This volume begins with a look back at the Roaring Twenties, then goes on to discuss such topics as the stock market crash; the presidencies of Hoover and Roosevelt; bloody labor and farm disputes; the entertainment industry; and the growing storm in Europe as the U.S. struggled with neutrality and readied itself for war. The text is inclusive yet brisk, and sidebars do an impressive job of extending the information. What frustrates is the typeface: the wealth of information is printed in small type on thin paper. The black-and-white photos are numerous and excellent, but the design is often bewildering. For instance, a page detailing Hoover's policies is bordered by information about the Art Deco movement. Despite format problems, report writers will find plenty here, and this will bolster history collections. A glossary and an extensive bibliography are appended. Books on the other decades of the twentieth century are also available.Ilene CooperCopyright © American Library Association.

I and the world demand more and we shall thump our tin mugs on the table demanding it until we are satisfied.' -- Stephen Fry There is only one writer alive today who is as mordantly funny as Kingsley Amis, as acute about human misery as Philip Larkin, and as brilliant in skewering pretension and vanity as both. His name is Roger Lewis... Nothing funnier or wise has been published all year. If you love someone buy them this book. If they don't appreciate the gift then purge them from your life. -- Michael Gove, Mail on Sunday 'Uproariously funny, tremendously clever and irresistibly lovable' -- Rupert Christiansen, Mail on Sunday 'Roger Lewis's new memoir takes us on an anarchic rollercoaster ride through what is probably the nearest thing to an autobiography he will ever write. Numerous hilarious routines jostle in the pages for attention. Lewis's strength is that behind all his acrobatics there is a richly stocked intellect at the controls. Stylistically he is ultramodern, a deracinated 'everyman; for the 21st century. -- Duncan Fallowell, Telegraph 'The funniest book of the year. What Am I Still Doing Here? by Roger Lewis is a wonderfully splenetic journal - part-diary, part-diatribe - by a man who rages with an indignant eloquence against the modern world. But Lewis' furious rants are never far from hilarity, and his anger is redeemed by flashes of pur poetry. Like all the best comics, Lewis is a disappointed optimist rather than an outright cynic, and it's this thwarted idealism which makes this such a liberating, life-affirming read.' -- Independent 'The jokes come thick and fast, the humour runs deep and dark. Among the belly laughs, Roger Lewis gifts us plenty of thought-provoking diamonds.' -- Graham Ball, Sunday Express He can be lethally catty and he also has an unfailingly sharp eye for absurdity. He is wonderfully funny, with a uniquely skewed take on the world.' -- John Preston, Spectator 'There's nobody else in the history of the world who is simultaneously as crude and dangerous or so gentle and poetic... Lewis, with his original and eloquent voice is nothing less than heroic.' -- Esquire 'Lewis is a marvellously wayward spirit, as well-versed in lavatory humour as in the classics, capable of taking in the gutter and the stars at a single glance.' 5* -- The Lady 'Enormously entertaining... It is generous, sincere and intelligent, and shows that Lewis is more than just the angry buffoon he paints himself as.' -- Evening Standard What Am I Still Doing Here? by Roger Lewis is one of those reads that is full of grumpy, thunderous, brilliantly funny observations -- Robert Bathurst, star of Downton Abbey, Daily Express", "related": [], "rank": 2919974, "title": "What Am I Still Doing Here?: My Life as Me", "author": "Roger Lewis", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So after graduating from high school, I decided to pursue a career in draftsmanship and geometrical design at Heald College in San Francisco.After completing my studies, I went to work as a draftsman for several design and architectural firms where I was able to further hone my skills as a detailed artist and draftsman.In 1980 I moved to Spokane, Washington where I was employed by a regional architectural firm designing restaurants and nightclubs. A few years later, I was fortunate enough to open up my own art studio where I created, produced and sold hand painted murals, signs, commercial art services and stained/etched glass.In 2000 I accepted a position in Las Vegas where I applied my design skills toward theatrical props and stage design for premier hotels in Las Vegas. I am now currently freelancing as a designer/artist serving the Southern Nevada and California areas.The mediums I use for my illustrations are pen and ink. I then digitize and colorize them on a computer, thus combining both worlds of hand drawn and computer enhanced artwork. Steve Talbott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The modified Rubicon Method is fully described in this book, and I hope it will be as much use to you as it has been for me.A little bit of the preface of the book:I was plagued throughout my early life with a lack of willpower. Often this manifested itself as procrastination, laziness, smoking, overeating, oversleeping, the inability to resist temptation. I have struggled to overcome these weaknesses and although I am not perfect in the last ten years I have:* stopped smoking (cold turkey).* completed two marathons and one half marathon (running almost 500 miles in training before each one).* written eight books while commuting 20 hours a week and holding down a full-time job.* got out of bed at 4 o'clock each morning to write.* stopped eating meat and become a vegetarian.Willpower is something required by everyone and I don't claim to have more than anyone else. But I have learned how to increase my willpower in the last ten years. The willpower I have is now stronger and lasts longer through repeated exercise. I've consistently worked to increase my willpower and self-discipline over a number of years and the benefits are paying off.", "related": [], "rank": 2556292, "title": "Increasing Willpower - Modified Rubicon Method", "author": "Rick Dearman", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As marketers, we know that if you have any type of business, and I do mean ANY type of business - there's one thing it must have... MARKETING! I know for some folks out there this word may send chills down their spine. But you and I know that it's the marketing that makes any business grow. I call it being the 'Rain Maker'. So, if you're a 'rain maker', this is a place where we can all share ideas, what we did, what's working, and even promote ourselves a little. We have developed the site on a WordPress platform for obvious reasons, like content management and SEO, so do make sure you link your bio back to your web site. What the Small Business Marketing Network is not... This is not going to be just another junk article directory, far from it... All contributors will be vetted. Meaning, as a contributor you must first register and submit your bio and photo. Someone from our staff will review your bio, visit your website, and may follow up with you via email to confirm you are who you say you are. So no fake (pen) names or email addresses... OK? This is not a place for blatant self-promotion... If you have a well-constructed bio, include your contact information and contribute good stuff, good stuff will follow. Also, this is not the place post countless stupid articles filled with affiliate hop links... There are plenty of those websites already, use them. I have nothing against affiliate marketing, and if you know of a solid product or resource that will actually help the community, by-all-means... Contribute a solid well thought out article and include your affiliate link if you'd like. But if every contribution you make has an affiliate link in it, we will just remove your contributions privileges and delete all your articles. So, put your best foot forward... become a contributor, fill out your bio and tell everyone a little about yourself, if you're a marketer.

Sports and civil rights are both part of the drama in this fictionalized biography in the Childhood of Famous Americans series. Growing up in segregated Richmond, Virginia, Ashe encountered vicious prejudice, including exclusion from the tennis court near his home. Even so, he went on to become an international star on the U.S. tennis team, and he broke the color barrier in the sport. The dialogue, thoughts, and feelings are made up, but the history is accurate. Readers will be caught by the details of Ashe's training, his game techniques, and his victories as well as by his important, sometimes controversial roles in the civil rights struggle and the antiapartheid movement. Despite the series title, there is much here about Ashe's adult life, though the focus is on his public role. Illustrated with occasional full-page black-and-white pictures, this lively introduction ends with a short bibliography that will take readers to documented accounts, including Ashe's memoir,Days of Grace(1993).Hazel RochmanCopyright © American Library Association.

Though the\ncentral characters are young, it is a general-fiction novel that is rife with\ngothic elements, as the title would suggest. Ms. Ross is a mother of two grown children and lives with\nher husband and four cats.

As a professional \"F\" Math student, I always found a sanctuary of relief in a novel or poem!  When I wrote a letter to the Editor of a local newspaper, sometime in 1980, little did I realize I had applied for a job! The Editor of the paper apprised me of his love for my writing style, and his interest in hiring me. I soon became the paper's parliamentary correspondent, in addition to writing columns, proofreading, and editing! As a Preliminary student at the University of Sierra Leone, I became a featured contributor to the famed \"Chuke's Press\", getting mostly rave reviews for poems, especially! After I was expelled from USL, I worked as a Reporter/Columnist for a few newspapers. I was also hired as a part-time English/Literature teacher, a position I proudly held until I left for the United States.

In 1973 he also published Narc, under the name Robert Hawke, beginning a hard-boiled nine-book series about a federal narcotics agent. A year later, Black Samurai introduced Robert Sand, a martial arts expert who becomes the first non-Japanese student of a samurai master. Based on Olden’s own interest in martial arts, which led him to the advanced ranks of karate and aikido, the novel spawned a successful eight-book series. Olden continued writing for the next three decades, often drawing on his fascination with Japanese culture and history.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The adventure begins when her friend, Chief Inspector Inglis, who lives in her father's apartment building, is baffled by the theft of an outrageously valuable necklace. Security camera footage shows the piece simply vanishing into thin air. Phyllis investigates but doesn't get anywhere until her father gives her an early birthday present-the key to the basement of the apartment building. Here lay all the props used by her mysterious and famous great grandfather, a magician of large renown who disappeared many years earlier. By studying the cache of tricks and magic accoutrements, Phyllis figures out who committed the series of unlikely crimes. McSkimming creates an aura of suspense by letting the reader in on some of what Phyllis learns, but leaving enough untold so that the revelations are as unexpected to the reader as they are to the Inspector, Phyllis's proud dad, and her friends. The characters are intelligent, persistent, and willing to trust in each other. McSkimming leaves room for a sequel with many questions still unanswered. Some words may be unfamiliar to American readers, but the context in which they are used should help define them.—B.

He has also written a screenplay for The Broken Statue. His next project has the working title Return From Wrath about a family struggling to find a home during The Great Depression that should be released later in 2012.  Bob’s latest release, Lydie’s Ghost, is about a young girl whose life rages with uncertainty when her mother and brother move to the small house on 13th Street. The twelve-year-old girl does not understand her life and everything she once trusted seems to be slipping away. When the girl goes to find her brother at an ominous old mansion a few blocks away from their house, she meets a mysterious old woman named Lydie with secrets of her own.  Lydie tells Jordan extraordinary stories about the mansion’s past, but the young girl wants to know more about the mysteries behind the now vacant mansion, and the secretive woman. As the young girl struggles to determine what is real and imagined, she learns things—and people—are not always what they seem. She discovers friends can come from the most unlikely places to make anyplace home. Bob is a graduate of Shawnee High School, Oklahoma Christian University, and East Central Oklahoma State University. He has also been actively involved in many community, civic, and professional groups.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Take, for example, his former boss’ request to travel all the way to Montreal to escort home the body of a deceased Yard colleague. Cammon initially has no intention of taking the job—Why should someone of his professional stature take on such a menial assignment?—but when he discovers that the dead man was murdered and that his death seems to be connected to a trio of missing Civil War–era letters, one of which might have been written by Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, Cammon’s curiosity and sense of justice get the better of him. Tightly plotted and featuring a lead character who keeps us glued to the page, the book should definitely suit readers looking for an intriguing lead character and a solid mystery. --David Pitt", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Virtually unknown and only published in ‘pulp’ magazines before he died in poverty, he is now widely seen as one of the most significant 20th century authors in his genre.  In high school Lovecraft found his contemporaries were accepting and he formed friendships. He also involved neighborhood children in elaborate make-believe projects, only regretfully ceasing the activity at 17 years old. Despite leaving school in 1908 without graduating - he found mathematics particularly difficult - Lovecraft’s knowledge of subjects that interested him was formidable. Throughout his life, selling stories and paid literary work for others did not provide enough to cover Lovecraft’s basic expenses. Living frugally, he subsisted on an inheritance that had almost gone in his last years, by which time he sometimes went without food to afford the cost of mailing letters.18 He was forced to move to smaller and meaner lodgings with his surviving aunt. He was also deeply affected by the suicide of his correspondent Robert E. Howard. In 1936, Lovecraft was diagnosed with cancer of the small intestine,19 and as a result he suffered from malnutrition. He lived in constant pain until his death on March 15, 1937, in Providence. In accordance with his lifelong scientific curiosity, he kept a diary of his illness until close to the moment of his death. Lovecraft was listed along with his parents on the Phillips family monument. That was not enough for his fans, who in 1977 raised the money to buy him a headstone of his own inSwan Point Cemetery, on which they had inscribed Lovecraft’s name, the dates of his birth and death, and the phrase “I AM PROVIDENCE,” a line from one of his personal letters.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dilloway has been a writer for most of his life. He completed his first story in third grade and received an ‘A’ for the assignment. Around that time, he was also placed in a local writing contest for a television station, receiving an action figure in lieu of a trophy, thus securing his love with the written word. Since then, he’s continued to spend most of his free time writing and editing. In the last twenty years, he’s completed nearly forty novels of various genres.  Two of those novels are already indie published. Where You Belong is the heartwarming story of a man in search of himself and his place in the world. Virgin Territory is a suspenseful tale of a man who finds love from beyond the grave. He has also indie published a volume of short stories collectively titled The Carnival Papers.  In 2012, Solistice Publishing published P.T.’s superhero novel A Hero’s Journey, Tales of the Scarlet Knight #1. That same year, December House Publishing included P.T.’s flash fiction stories as part of the collection We Are Now. Also in 2012, P.T. created the imprint Planet 99 Publishing to publish the remainder of the Tales of the Scarlet Knight series as well as a variety of other novels, all of which can be found at http://www.planet99publishing.com. When not writing, P.T. enjoys reading and photographing Michigan’s many lighthouses. In order to pay the bills, he earned an accounting degree from Saginaw Valley State University in 2000 and for the past ten years has worked as a payroll accountant in Detroit. He lives in suburban Detroit, where he continues to work on new writing projects. If you want to find him, just search the Panera Breads and Starbuckses near Detroit on weekends.

There are few things as satisfying as sitting down to a homemade meal with those you love.  I am by no means a professional chef, but I would like to think that I'm a good home cook. I especially love to create delicious meals that are easy to prepare and made with a minimum of fuss. I believe that if it takes too long to prepare, then it better be worth it! My interest in cooking came to me while I was working as a waitress in a small local café. I loved everything about it ... the amazing smells of simmering soup and freshly baked bread, the spicy aroma of a healthy bowl of gumbo, and the melt in your mouth goodness of an apple pie that just came out of the oven. The art of baking and cooking captivated my soul. My Incurable \"Disease\" But my newly found love for cooking came at a cost. I have developed a severe (but non-life-threatening) disease called \"Low-Resistance-to-Yummy-Recipes-Syndrome\" (a.k.a Cookbookitis). One of the symptoms of this disease is the complete inability to resist collecting cookbooks, magazines with recipes, even those little brand name mini-cookbooks positioned oh-so-temptingly next to grocery store checkout lanes. For years I tried to get around this by doing most of my major grocery shopping at Costco. But guess what? Costco started selling cookbooks and now my collection continues to grow. I'm slightly embarrassed to say that I have at least 500, maybe more, cookbooks (now I did say it's a disease!). I am going to try to inventory my collection of cookbooks soon. I'll let you know how many I have when I finally catalogue and classify all of them. With soooooo many cookbooks, I am always trying to find the best foods to feed my family. I am passionate about only serving my family meals that will strengthen, grow, and energize them. I have been reading my many cookbooks and started thinking about creating my own cookbooks and sharing my many creations with other avid home cooks. There is always so much to learn! You will notice that I try to keep my cooking style clean and simple. I know that the more simple I keep it, the more likely I'm going to succeed in consistently preparing beautiful and tasty meals. It's been a journey of learning and experimenting in the kitchen, but one that I've greatly enjoyed. I hope that my cookbooks will help you in your journey as well!", "related": [], "rank": 1606480, "title": "Gluten Free Diet Cookbook: Healthier Eating Choices for People with Celiac Disease", "author": "Maria Holmes", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 19, "rating_average": 4.4211, "rating_total": 84.0}

Prior residences were in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. During his working years, he served as a Project Engineer for a large manufacturing corporation. Upon early retirement he became the President of Burhop Associates, Inc. a project engineering consulting company for the packaging industry.  Interest in the Civil War and in American History led Ray to do extensive research and finally led to the publishing of the book on the history of “The Twenty Fourth Illinois Infantry Regiment”.   His grandfather’s experience in the building and first voyage of the Titanic generated Rays interest in this great ship.  This led Ray to become the Chief Docent for the Titanic exhibit during the nine month stay at the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, Fl.  Ray continues to provide presentations on the tragedy of the Titanic.          The closing of the Titanic exhibit presented an opportunity for Ray to become associated with Cracker Country, the living history museum at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, FL.  He served as a tour guide, docent and “unofficial volunteer historian”. The objective of this living history museum is to provide the public with the experience of a Florida Cracker community during the period of 1890 to 1910.  The railroad depot originally located at Okahumpka is a very dominate feature at Cracker Country and generates many questions about the depot and the town of Okahumpka.  Several years ago the author and his wife relocated from Tampa to central Florida, not too far from Okahumpka.   The Director of the museum at Cracker Country suggested Ray initiate some research on the depot and the town.  This has ultimately led to the publishing of, “Okahumpka, The History of a Florida Cracker Community”.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Let me finish this up and then we can decide what to do tonight.\"\"I didn't say I was spending tonight with you.\"\"It's five on a Friday, you're in a rotten mood and I'm not letting you hit any damned clubs in Honolulu tonight. You'll do something you'll regret. Then, I will have to deal with that. I don't have time for that. How about we do dinner in?\"He smiled. \"That sounds good.\"\"And you can drink as much as you want and stay over.\"She packaged up the fruit while Colin made himself coffee.\"I might want some of that,\" he said without turning around.\"Too bad. It's for the Santinis.\"\"Santinis? There are more of them?\"Before she could answer, she heard her SUV pull into the drive and then over to the cottage she rented Marco.\"Yes. They're here to visit.\"She picked up the container and headed to the door. She felt him on her heels and turned around and put her hand on his chest. If Colin saw her with the lieutenant, he would know she was interested in him.\"No. You stay here. I'm not going to deal with you and them.\"He frowned but there was a bit of sparkle in his eyes. She sighed and headed out to catch the brothers before they left. She could have slipped in earlier and left the fruit for them but she didn't. She knew the lieutenant wouldn't have minded but for some reason, that had felt wrong. Unless there was a good reason, she didn't like to invade a tenant's privacy.As she neared the cottage, the noise level rose. There was laughing and she was sure insults. She smiled. It reminded her a lot of her brothers when they were younger. Kai and Mikala always seemed to have their volume set to twenty on a scale of ten. She knocked on the door, then had to do it again because apparently she couldn't be heard over the discussion.The door opened with a whoosh and she came face to face with a younger version of Santini. Except, this one was blond and had golden brown eyes. He blinked, then, his lips curved. Two dimples appeared.Oh, my.\"Well, hello. Can I help you?\" he asked.\"Who is it, Gee?\" a man asked loudly from somewhere in the cottage. She wasn't sure if it was Lieutenant Santini though.\"I have no idea but I think I'm in love,\" the aforementioned Gee said.\"Lieutenant Santini, it's just me.\"She thought she heard him curse, then he came to the door with a frown. Oh, no, he was irritated with her. She always tried her best to stay out of her tenants' way but she wanted to make sure his brothers were welcomed properly to the island.\"I just brought some pineapple by for your brothers.\"\"You can move now, Gee,\" the lieutenant said.\"I think Mom would be embarrassed by your manners.\" He didn't stop staring at her and something tickled the back of her throat as she felt her face heat up. He took her hand in his. \"My name is Gianni, but everyone calls me Gee. Will you marry me?\"Before she could answer, another of the brothers showed up. This one was older and if possible, bigger. Dark haired and blue-eyed, he was just a gorgeous as the others. Goodness.\"And you can call me, Vince.\"\"Go away. I found her first,\" Gee said playfully. \"If you won't marry me, how about just dating me?\"Vince bumped his brother in the back but Gee ignored him. The older brother sighed. \"How many times do I have to tell the rest of you? Finders are not keepers, especially when there's a Marine around.\"\"She's mine,\" Marco said.Both brothers broke their attention from her and looked at him. She did the same and thought his cheeks were turning pink. It was actually very cute. He was such a big man and to see him blush...well it made her like him even more.\"Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I meant this is my landlady, Alana Kailikea. These are two of my idiot brothers. The third is on the phone with his wife.\"She couldn't say anything. There was just too much male beauty to form a coherent thought. Two of them were smiling at her and one was frowning, but it didn't matter. Any heterosexual woman would have problems speaking around them. Lord, Honolulu wouldn't know what hit them.\"Guys, you're making her nervous. And, Gee, it's going to be hard to be a PJ missing a hand.\" Gee raised her hand to his lips, kissed it, then winked before letting it go. After the brothers shuffled back in the house, Santini sighed.\"I'm sorry about that. They can be pains in the a...butt.\"She smiled. \"No worries. My brothers were the same way. Here's the pineapple. I don't want to intrude on your weekend, but seeing that you're men, I have a feeling you won't make it to a good produce stand before they leave. Everyone needs to have fresh pineapple when they come to the islands. It's a rule.\"Good lord, she was rambling on about fruit and Hawaii. She blamed it on the Santinis but it was one reason she avoided long conversations with the lieutenant. She babbled when she was confronted by a gorgeous man.He took the fruit and smiled. \"That sounds fantastic. But we might have some decent food since Vince likes to cook.\"\"I'm not cooking for you, Marco,\" his brother yelled from the other room.\"I'll let you get back to your brothers. Make sure you let me know if you need anything.\"He nodded and just kept staring at her. He was so quiet at times, it was hard to be in his presence. For a few moments, she just stood there and stared.

I started my writing career by writing non-fiction and wrote two books about health and fitness (I am a trained fitness teacher). While writing these books, I discovered how much I loved the actual writing process. My then editor gave me the idea to write a fun novel based on my experiences as a diplomat’s wife. This became my debut novel, ‘Diplomatic Incidents’ (the e-book version is called ‘Duty Free’), published in 2001. I wrote three further novels, ‘European Affairs’ (now as an e-book with the title ‘Villa Caramel’), ‘Fresh Powder’ (2006) and ‘Finding Margo’(2007). The latter two were published by New Island Books in Dublin. In 2010, when the publishing industry started to decline, I broke away from both publisher and agent and e-published my backlist, along with two novels that were with my agent for submission. Since then I have written and e-published four further novels and, as a result, now have ten books out there in the e-book market worldwide. I write mainly in the women’s fiction genre, some chick-lit, some contemporary romance, with two historical novels and two detective stories thrown into the mix. I enjoyed writing those but my first love is romantic fiction with a lot of humour and heart.  My bestselling romantic comedy, Fresh Powder was translated to German last year and, with the title ‘Frischer Schnee’, is selling well on Amazon.de.

Above all, it will renew your gratitude to God for making such an art possible. --Jeremy Begbie, author of Resounding Truth: Christian Wisdom in the World of MusicAs a bookseller I am sometimes asked to help people find just the right book that will help them relate Christian faith to their careers, callings, interests and passions. Sometimes, in some fields, this is difficult, if there are few great books in that field, or they are exceedingly difficult, less than theologically reliable, or poorly written. Occasionally, though, I see a book and I want to tell everybody interested in its topic that it is a must-read, a nearly perfect resource for their precise purposes. Even more rare is the book I want to tell everybody everywhere to read, as a model of creative Christian scholarship, useful, artful, beautifully designed, insightful, fun. It Was Good: Making Music to the Glory of God is just such a book. Everyone should be so fortunate as to have a book like this in their area of interest! Certainly for every musician, of any sort, and for anyone who likes music or even for those who don t this is a magnificent book, amazingly conceived and wonderfully produced. This is a truly remarkable achievement. Spread the word! --Byron Borger, Hearts & Minds BookstoreIt s easy to take good music for granted because there s so much available and because we know what we like. So we listen amidst the static of busyness and wish at least occasionally that we could listen leisurely instead of distractedly. In It Was Good: Making Music to the Glory of God, we are asked to pause and listen with ears made sharper with understanding. The thirty chapters need not be read in any particular order, are brief enough to fit into any schedule, and are thoughtful and accessible enough to warrant reflection and discussion. From silence to songwriting to jazz to touring to harmony to improvisation to the blues, rich layers of musical reality are unpacked so they can be appreciated for people who love music but who are not musicians. It Was Good: Making Music to the Glory of God is written by gifted artisans to help us know music more deeply and so be able to hear, love and enjoy it and its Creator with greater clarity. Please read it, and listen, and then listen some more. --Denis Haack, Co-director of Ransom Fellowship", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His book clearly speaks to the challenges that bayou communities face in maintaining the difficult balance of economy, environment, and infrastructure. --Windell CuroleEver readable and always even-handed, Theriot offers a much-needed investigation into the beguiling history, the fascinating science, and above all the byzantine politics of what may be the nation's worst ongoing environmental crisis, as year by year a huge and valuable slice of America's Energy Coast slides irreplaceably into the sea. --Glen Pitre", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
