She said she couldn't get you on your cell. She needs you to call home right away.\"Michael reached for the phone she set on the counter for him and punched in his number. When the babysitter answered, he wasted no time greeting her. \"What's wrong, Heather?\"\"Cody has a fever of 104 degrees. I think he's really sick. What should I do?\"Michael frowned. Cody hadn't even had a cold for months. He must have been exposed to something at school. But what kind of flu bug would cause a fever that high? He'd have to phone Jennie and find out if his friends had been sick. \"Just keep him comfortable until I get home. There's a bottle of children's acetaminophen in the medicine cabinet. Give him four of those. If his fever doesn't start dropping after that, call me back.\" He handed the phone to the clerk.\"Dr. Stratton. Your patient in 208 is totally dilated,\" an O.B. nurse informed him as she passed. \"The baby's head is at plus one.\"\"Tell them I'm on my way.\" He washed up quickly and donned his scrubs. When he hurried into room 208, Julie Miller was just beginning to push. She strained, her hair plastered against her forehead with sweat. At last she fell back against the pillow. \"I can't do this!\" she told anyone who would listen. \"I never intended to do this without drugs,\" she said, half teasing, and completely serious. \"Drugs, Dr. Stratton. Anesthesia. Pain relief.\"\"The baby's coming too fast, Julie. What you've got here is a nice natural childbirth. Something a lot of people are going to envy you for.\"\"But I…can't…\"\"Oh, yes. You can.\" He moved to the foot of the birthing bed, pulled up the stool and sat down. \"Let's have a baby here. I can see the head.\"\"Can you?\" she asked breathlessly, raising her head slightly as tears of exertion streamed down her cheeks.\"It's right here. I see dark hair, lots of it. Another few pushes and this will be over. Come on, Julie.\"Michael had seen hundreds of women through labor and delivery. But he still couldn't do it without feeling a little twinge of pride and sadness, thinking of his own son's birth eight years ago. Jennie had been so brave. And Cody had been such a gift to both of them. There had been a time when they both thought that loving their son might be enough to save their marriage. But it hadn't happened that way.\"I feel the contraction coming. It's coming. I don't… \"\"You can do it, Julie,\" her husband said, encouraging her.\"Focus all your energy on this push,\" Michael urged. \"Let your body do this for you. Keep your knees wide. Hold on. Hold on.\"\"Good,\" his nurse joined in, cheering her on. \"Perfect.\"In spite of the fast, easy birth, this patient would need an episiotomy. He performed it quickly as Julie Miller began to strain again.The baby's head emerged. A shoulder came next and then the rest of the newborn slipped out, a fine, healthy boy, already bleating for his mother. Michael handed her the baby as the nurse wrapped Julie in warm blankets. \"Thanks,\" she whispered.After Michael showed the father how to cut the cord and allowed the proud new parents to count fingers and toes, he examined the infant himself and gave him a high Apgar score. \"Congratulations!\" He shook the father's hand before he tucked his charts beneath his arm. Then he touched Julie's arm. \"Good work, Mom.\"With that, he swung briskly out of room 208 and headed for the fourth floor and his next patient. He looked forward to his visits with Bill Josephs. \"Well, Bill,\" he said, leaning back against the wall and studying his elderly client from a distance. \"You look good enough to run a marathon.\"\"I am looking good,\" the old man bellowed at him. \"I am feeling good. When're you gonna send me home, Doc?\"\"Well—\" Michael appeared to consider as he winked at Bill's wife, adjusting his bedside manner to fit comfortable country folks and friends \"—how about tomorrow?\"\"Yes!\" Bill lifted a fist in victory. \"Dr. Michael, it's about time you let me out of this confounded place.\"\"You don't follow my orders, you'll be right back here.\" Michael scribbled a prescription and handed the little paper to Bill's wife, Marge. \"You take that three times a day and you'll be good as new.\"\"What is this stuff?\" Bill chortled. \"Viagra?\"Michael had known the Josephs since he'd graduated from med school. Bill's jokes didn't faze him at all anymore. \"You rest every afternoon. The minute the farm news report is over and you've eaten lunch, I want you flat on your back for thirty minutes.\"\"I'll make him do it,\" Marge promised.\"No smoking. And when you're drinking coffee with your buddies down at the Ferris Dairy Queen, make sure it's decaf.\"\"You gonna make me drink unleaded for the rest of my life?\" Bill asked.\"Yeah.\" Michael slapped the man's chart shut. \"I am. I'll see you in my office in two weeks.\"\"We'll be there,\" Marge promised again. \"I know how to boss this old coot around.\"Michael hugged her. He didn't hug many of his patients, but the Josephs were practically family. \"Take good care of him. You're going to have him around for a long time.\"Marge shook her head and grinned. \"That's what I was afraid of.\"Michael hurried upstairs to sign Bill's release papers. As he scrawled his signature, his BlackBerry sprang to life. When he went to answer it, he lost the call. Michael shook his head. The concrete walls of the hospital wreaked havoc on his cell-phone signal. He checked the screen to see if it had been his office trying to reach him. But it wasn't. His home number had been calling. Cody's babysitter again.The hospital pager on his belt went off. He headed to the nearest house phone and picked it up. \"Heather Rogers is on the line,\" the operator told him. \"She says it's an emergency.\"\"Put her through,\" he said.\"I gave Cody the medicine.\" The minute he heard the girl's voice he could tell how distraught she was. \"His fever won't go down. And he isn't crying anymore. He's just lying there like a big blob in the bed.\"\"Is he asleep, Heather?\"\"I don't know.\"Michael frowned and raked a hand through his hair. He glanced at his watch. Cody's fever should have come down by now—way down. Michael calculated. He could be at the house in twenty minutes.\"Wake Cody and give him a sponge bath. Can you do it? If it frightens you, maybe your mother could come to the house and help.\" Fear gripped Michael like a vise. Surely, Cody had the flu. But what if this was something else, something much worse? This was one of the downfalls of his profession. For years, he'd been studying worst-case scenarios.I'm a doctor, he reminded himself. I've just delivered a baby and prolonged a heart-attack victim's life. Cody won't have any problems I can't deal with.He notified them at the nurses' station and headed toward his parking space. Even though it was past 8:00 p.m., it took several minutes for Michael to find a break in the Dallas traffic so he could enter Central Express-way after he'd gotten to his car. He didn't have to change lanes or pass to exceed the speed limit. He sped toward Plano with everyone else, cruising along at over seventy. When he wheeled his car into the driveway, he recognized Heather's mother's car there, too. Inside, he found them both holding Cody in the bathtub, squeezing washcloths of water down his little chest and arms.\"Cody, kiddo, what's wrong?\" He stroked his son's hair while his fear escalated. The boy's face was ashen.\"Can you tell me if anything hurts?\"\"My eyes,\" Cody whimpered. \"And my neck and everything.\"\"Your head? Does your head hurt?\"Cody tried to nod but he winced instead.\"Mostly your neck, though. Huh?\"\"Yeah.\"Michael bent beside the tub and gathered his son into his arms. He soaked his shirt but he didn't care. Cody tried to smile but he was too weak to move. His eyes lolled backward.Michael succumbed to his panic. He was no longer the capable physician; he was a frightened father, too afraid to know what to do. \"We've got to call an ambulance,\" he said to Heather's mother. And then he started barking orders at them. \"Dial 911 for me. Then give me the receiver.\" He wasn't going to let Cody out of his arms.Heather dialed the emergency number and then leaned the phone against Michael's shoulder. He gripped it with his chin. He ordered an ambulance in clipped tones, answered as many of the EMT's questions as he could.\"Dr. Stratton, I'm so sorry,\" Heather cried when she took the phone from him again. \"I don't know what I did wrong.\"\"You've done a fine job, Heather.\" He forced himself to reassure the girl. Her round face mirrored the fear he felt himself. \"You got your mother here. You got me home to him. And I wasn't so easy to convince, was I?\" He moved around the room with his son in his arms, hoping that the air stirring against Cody's wet skin would cool him. The boy felt hot enough to go into convulsions.Think, he commanded himself. You've got to examine this child as if he wasn't your own.Carefully he propped Cody up on the bathroom counter and studied his face. \"Say 'ah,'Cody. Dad needs to see inside your throat.\"\"Ah-h-h,\" Cody obliged listlessly. Michael could hardly see anything without his light. What he could see looked slightly red but not inflamed. Gently, he bent Cody's neck forward, testing whether he could touch the child's chin to his chest.Cody cried out.Michael didn't hesitate when the paramedics arrived. \"You'll need a spinal tap and a culture on him,\" he said. \"Have someone from the lab standing by.\" As they looked askance at him, he realized they didn't know he was a doctor. \"I'm a general practitioner,\" he said. \"Where are you taking us?\"\"Plano General is closest.\"\"Just get us there.\"As they sped through the traffic it felt like a snail's pace to Michael. It seemed an eternity before they arrived. After that, things got even worse. He watched helplessly as the paramedics wheeled Cody in on the gurney. An E.R. nurse tried to direct him. \"The waiting room is in here, Mr.—\"\"It's Dr. Stratton,\" he sai...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

S. entomologist, evolutionary biologist, and science administrator. He studied under Francis Snow at the University of Kansas. From 1894 to 1920 he was professor of entomology at Stanford University. He specialized in insect taxonomy and economic entomology. Herbert Hoover was among his students. His academic career was interrupted by two years (1915 and 1916) spent in Brussels as director of Hoover's humanitarian American Commission for Relief in Belgium. Initially a pacifist, Kellogg dined with the officers of the German Supreme Command. He became shocked by the grotesque Darwinian motivation for the German war machine - \"the creed of natural selection based on violent and fatal competitive struggle is the Gospel of the German intellectuals\". He decided these ideas could only be beaten by force and, using his connections with America's political elite, began to campaign for American intervention in the war. He published an account of his conversations in the book Headquarters Nights (1917). His other works include: New Mallophaga (1896), Elementary Zoology (1901), Genera Insectorum (1906), and Insect Stories (1908).", "related": [], "rank": 1580183, "title": "Herbert Hoover", "author": "Vernon Kellogg", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Buford, a second-halfer himself and the founder of Leadership Network, a support ministry for pastors and church leaders, blends both success and failure stories, anecdotes, Web resources, and wisdom from his previous  books, (HalftimeandGame Plan) to spur readers to action. In the three sections of this compact volume, he examines why people get stuck in the second half, gives practical advice for getting unstuck, and offers help for living a second half with significance. An ideal, purposeful second half is one where work, meaning, and happiness merge, and readers can be fully engaged in activities that match their skills, capacity, and mission, he writes. If these factors are in  place, Buford believes second-halfers will find satisfaction in work that  adds meaning and purpose to life. \"The second half is where the joy is,\" he  writes.--Cindy Crosby", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Book #3 in this layered, complex pre-Civil War tale of the first home-grown terrorist attack on a US Armory in history, set in 1859 is through the eyes of the infamous John Brown? NO...through the eyes of his sexually active 17-year-old daughter. While it chronicles what happened at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, the dramatic novel is one foremost of love and romance at the forefront, and it devolves into a fierce gun battle. It reads like a western for good reason. If a fan of the recent Kevin Costner film on the Hatfields and the McCoys, this fits right in that ballpark...and in fact, I modeled my John Brown on Kostner's role as Devil Anse. The two men would have had a lot in common. Anse and Brown that is...not Costner.", "related": ["B003J359Z6"], "rank": 1165703, "title": "Titanic 2012", "author": "Robert W.

Duncan's (1919–1988) great meditation on modernism's last remaining question mark finally sees print. Published as the first volume in California's Collected Writings of Robert Duncan series, this lovingly prepared volume presents this long critical work, written in 1960 and 1961, in its full form for the first time. It brilliantly reconstructs the dynamics of Pound, Williams, and H.D.'s complex, charged, evolving poet relations, and of H.D.'s eventual departure from the modernist mainstream into a classicism that exasperated Williams, but clearly fascinates Duncan. It reveals Duncan's own poetic relationship to H.D., with whom he corresponded late in the latter poet's life. It tracks a canonical murder, by which critics (beginning with Randall Jarrell) systematically exclude H.D. from the modernist pantheon. And it shows Duncan, whose great longer works lay ahead of him, struggling to find a poetic kernel within H.D.'s oeuvre. While this book is staged as an elaborate defense of H.D.'s work, and especially her austere and archaic-seeming late poetry, it is best read as the daybook of a poet as he absorbs, thinks through, departs from, returns to, and loves a major antecedent.

This year we got more than normal and when you are snowed in, your options for activities are limited. Some folks watch TV. Some drink themselves silly. I write.Reflections of better years and better times tend to bubble to the surface, particularly when our country and the world seems to be in such chaos. The decade of the '50s is known as a time of relative sanity and innocence. I began to jot down  escapades and a few adventures my friends and I engaged in back in our youth. Most of these seem humorous a half century later and, of course, I embellish stories somewhat. I've written many books for music publishers, many of which are used in high schools and colleges, and I've also co-authored interactive computer software programs for music education. I've written and published monthly magazines, written newspaper columns and I've had many other writing projects, but \"The Huckleberry Days of the '50s\" was the most fun.This book is guaranteed to generate memories in people in my generation and curiosity in members of my kid's and grandchildren's generation. But no matter what your age happens to be, you are also guaranteed a laugh or two...or three.Perhaps the best way to describe \"The Huckleberry Days of the '50\"  is to provide a sample story.Why Are Boys Driven to Build Forts?\"I think it's a genetic adaptation or defense mechanism that drives boys to build forts, because every kid I knew back in elementary school had a fort. To build a fort was something that boys were instinctively driven to do and the more complex, with underground tunnels and places to hide, the more admiration you received from your peers and from those you allowed to enter your domain.\"If a kid tried to build a fort today, he'd be required to have a building permit, an environmental impact report, a variance of some sort, a union contract, liability insurance , worker comp, a health plan, a sprinkler system, and about thirty additional permits and clearances.  HUD, OSHA, EPA and County Planning are just a few of the agencies that would be looking over the kid's shoulders as he dug his foxhole, reinforcing it with scrap plywood, and covering it with branches for camouflage.  His building project would be red tagged for code violations before he put on the roof.  I don't think it's as much fun to be a kid nowadays.\"A tree fort was the ultimate fortress, but more skill was required in the construction of a tree fort.  After flooring boards broke and a number of us fell out of trees, most of us decided to stick to digging holes.  There was a group of kids who felt they had the physical attributes for tree living, but it didn't work well for them either.\"The main problem with the \"tree dwellers,\" who tried to build tree forts, was that those with prehensile tails didn't have opposable thumbs.  The could climb trees and get around up there all right, but they couldn't handle a hammer.\"The drive to build a fort was something young boys couldn't control.  When you hit a certain age, you became a fort-building machine and you wanted the best fort in the neighborhood.  The blue prints for forts are rolled up somewhere in a boy's DNA waiting to unfold at just the right time in his development.  Like a duck imprinting on mama duck, when that timer goes off, the kid is a full blown min-architect.  He can't help it. It's beyond his control.\"If the urge to build a fort hits too early, a small child will become obsessed with hiding behind furniture or under blankets hung over chairs.  But if it hits too late in life, the unfortunate young man may eventually find himself living in tunnels under New York City or in the sewer system of Chicago.\"Miraculously this building urge hit all my friends at about the same time.  The neighborhood was pock-marked with foxholes and it looked like the area had been taken over by a hoard of large ground squirrels.  Wood disappeared from construction sites and the sound of hammers punctuated the rhythmic grinding of hand saws.\"We definitely needed wood for our forts.  A local contractor was building a house on the next street over from ours and the word on the street was that his house come up one bedroom and half a garage short.  He ran out of lumber.  The poor guy was still studiying his wood order when I tossed the last of the camouflage over my hideout.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2056329, "title": "The Huckleberry Days of the '50s", "author": "Ralph Higgins", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

(who is an author as well – www.jrthompsonauthor.com). Following in his older brother, Michael’s footsteps (www.mikejamesmusic.net), he began singing songs with the guitar at a young age. Later, after a short career in the US Navy and many moves, he settled in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.  Continuing to gig steadily in bands and as a solo act, he was also a sea kayak guide, adventure ropes course counselor, started his own renaissance sword fencing school, learned graphic design, and had many misadventures which, God willing, will never see print.  After twenty years of trying to make a break in the music industry, he decided to settle down and pursue a relationship with a wonderful woman from Northern Ireland, where he now resides. Since childhood Monte was an avid fan of fantasy and science fiction. Over the years of driving long hours into the night to or from gigs, he conceptualized stories.

Every 'bad habit' I read about reminded me I'm not alone in the battle to shake off the outdated and ineffective methods of healthcare marketing from the past. I'm inspired! I definitely plan to share this book with my marketing communications team (so they can have the same therapy!) and our executive leaders. Chris' marketing wisdom will provide credible support for our marketing ideas that may seem 'out there' to our leaders. Just as our leaders are challenged with the new realities in healthcare, I want them to be educated on the new realities in marketing, and this book will help me do just that.\" --Heidi W. Grunkemeyer, Operations Director, Marketing & Communications, Alegent Health\"From the title all the way to the last page, Chris tells it like it is, calling out the state of the health care marketing today and suggesting bold, but common sense, approaches that offer clear direction in today's rapidly changing environment. There is an urgency to his message during these times of transition in the health care industry, when yesterday's more comfortable marketing tactics won't work in the new world of ACOs, health care reform and empowered consumers. This is a book for marketing professionals, folks in the C-suite, physician leaders, and anybody else who is ready to be courageous and look at alternatives to how hospitals and health care services are marketed today. Chris helps us see clearly what isn't working (because Joe Public really doesn't care about your hospital) and then suggests ways to challenge current thinking and even take some risks to create messages and develop marketing plans that will lead to real, measurable results. He proposes ways to build support and create an offensive line that can defend innovative marketing plans and tactics against inertia, internal political pressure and institutional roadblocks. Whack-a-mole marketing, right-side-of-the-menu marketing, zombie brands ... we've all been there because we didn't recognize the alternatives. This is the first time I've ever laughed out loud reading a book about hospital marketing. Selections from his WeeklyProbe blog start each chapter with 'Onion-like' stories that would be even funnier if they weren't so true.\" --Tom Hayes, Director of Public Relations and Marketing, Hennepin Healthcare System, Inc.\"Chris Bevolo has done it again. His newest book is timely, entertaining, instructive and on-target. After 30+ years as a healthcare professional with expertise in the marketing and communications areas, I wish this book didn't have to be written. Unfortunately, it is needed by healthcare organizations across the country that need to sharpen, retune and refocus their marketing efforts for a new era. The chapters on branding and measurement are particularly insightful. Healthcare marketers ready to take the challenge will be energized by the focus on planning, being proactive, taking calculated risks, and measuring ROI. If you're ready to be a marketing leader in the Value-Based Purchasing era, to be an active and strategic partner at the senior table, and to succeed while those around you are floundering, Chris' latest book will serve as a roadmap to accelerate your journey along the pathway to success.\" --Lynne Cunningham, Coach, Studer Group\"From the title all the way to the last page, Chris tells it like it is, calling out the state of the health care marketing today and suggesting bold, but common sense, approaches that offer clear direction in today's rapidly changing environment.

I loved this book Sarah Blake, author of The Postmistress Elif Shafak tells stories of great urgency, heart, and intellectual acuity. Honour is a powerful tale of family connection and heartbreak, offering us insight and delight in equal measure. This is a compulsively readable novel, an exquisite and deep rendering of the fullness of life. Aurelie Sheehan, author of The Anxiety of Everyday Objects Shafak will challenge Paulo Coelho's dominance The Independent An honour killing is at the centre of this stunning novel... Exotic, evocative and utterly gripping The Times Lushly and memorably magic-realist... This is an extraordinarily skilfully crafted and ambitious narrative The Independent The book calls to mind The Color Purple in the fierceness of its engagement with male violence and its determination to see its characters to a better place. But Shafak is closer to Isabel Allende in spirit, confidence and charm. Her portrayal of Muslim cultures, both traditional and globalising, is as hopeful as it is politically sophisticated. This alone should gain her the world audience she has long deserved The Guardian In Honour, Shafak treats an important, absorbing subject in a fast-paced, internationally familiar style that will make it accessible to a wide readership Sunday Times Fascinating and gripping - a wonderful novel Rosamund Lupton, author of Sister Vivid storytelling... that explores the darkest aspects of faith and love Sunday Telegraph Moving, subtle and ultimately hopeful, Honour is further proof that Shafak is the most exciting Turkish novelist to reach western readers in years Irish Times", "related": ["B004XIB2YS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That gave a lot of confidence to a sickly kid with asthma.As a result I flew for forty-four years; everything from biplanes to the huge DC-10 that carried 350 passengers. There were revolutions in the Congo, wars in Laos, Vietnam, and Desert Storm I participated in as a pilot. Good times - bad times - it has all been the stuff of legend. Sometimes scared out of my wits; other times having more fun than the law allowed - seldom bored.Then there was the sailing. Little boats, big boats, around the bay, across the ocean with the same sense of excitement and adventure that I experienced with flying. Amazingly my China-born wife was at my side as we crossed to Tahiti in Quark, the 29' boat I built. (Something worked; we've been married forty-four years this June.)With the airlines a pilot must retire at age sixty. Since I quaified for a marine captain's license, I changed hats and began a whole new career delivering yachts up and down the Coast between Canada and Mexico. This continued for ten years until the writing bug insisted I put down some of my experiences for others to share.And that, ladies and gentlemen is how I've come to write Sailin' South, Maverick Pilot, volumes I, II, & III, and soon to be finished, my first fiction novel, Keeper of the Secrets - an MIA Laos yarn.", "related": [], "rank": 1824409, "title": "Maverick Pilot, Vol II eBook", "author": "Dave Case", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The climax of the story is a Jubilee\nperformance from a children's orchestra and various pieces of music are\ncleverly woven into the action.In the second story, we meet a mother with a tricky choice to make- in the end she chooses to follow her heart.Th\n third story represents somewhat of a departure from the themes of other\n short stories from this author and is altogether darker and more\nsinister. We are left wondering until the end what punishment will be\nhanded out (and to whom).I thoroughly recommend these stories- a quick read that leaves a lasting impression.N.Young UKJubilee\n Violin instantly captivated me with a beautifully descriptive first\nparagraph that unfolded into a mesmerising tale of age, youth and music...C.Plunkett, UK", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}

Dummer’s former friend and colleague, Serge Bastarde, along with his beautiful wife, had abandoned France for Martinique some years earlier. One day at an antiques market, Serge suddenly reappears: his wife ran off with a rich yachtsman, absconding also with their son and Serge’s beloved dog. Dummer’s wife fears that her husband will be once again drawn into some cockamamie scheme of the sort Serge has been known to devise too often. Now Serge’s grown son from an earlier liaison has teamed up with his father, and the duo reinforce each other’s odder traits. This volume continues the tale begun in Serge Bastarde Ate My Baguette (2009), and it will equally appeal to readers eager for yet more tales of denizens populating France’s backcountry. --Mark Knoblauch", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It has since expanded it to include the parents and children of any special needs children (e.g. Autism, Williams syndrome,Cancer, heart conditions, Cerebral Palsy, etc.) After seeing how retelling her experiences were helping other parents of children with special needs, Georgia began a series (Tori's Adventures) that chronicles Tori's adventures through doctor's appointments, friendships, and school as a child with Down syndrome.  This series intends to familiarize parents of children with Down syndrome with some common Down syndrome medical procedures and offers inspiration; Tori, with her happy cheerful nature has overcome difficult times and has already shown her family what it means to be alive.", "related": [], "rank": 4797731, "title": "Fun Places To Go", "author": "Georgia Villalobos", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After a knock at her hotel-room door, Tsippy opens it to find Bella Kugelman, an elderly woman who, despite her age and frailty, pushes her way into the room and refuses to leave. Bella is desperate to tell Tsippy her life’s story. Bella speaks of her childhood, her early life in Poland, and, in particular, the bustling town of Bedzin. Through Bella’s stories, the streets of Bedzin come alive, and its inhabitants become familiar friends. Through the magic of Mrs. Kugelman’s storytelling, Tsippy’s world takes on new meaning. As Bella’s story comes to a close, Nazi Germany has begun to take its first bites out of Jewish life in Poland. The strength of Pradelski’s novel lies in the fascinating glimpse it provides into a world that was destroyed. Her prose is graceful and generous, and the reader, too, gets caught up in that world. Despite the lack of a structured plot, this is a welcome reminder of the value of stories and the magic that happens when we truly listen. --Carol Gladstein", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Emma was easily accepted into the family dynamic and it helped bring the story full circle.I loved that Emma was a strong character who was able to admit what she wanted, but also understand what Mike's concerns were.Overall, this is a fast-paced, incredibly sexy love story that is sure to melt your heart.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I grew up traveling the world without ever leaving the comfort of my room. I always knew I wanted to write, to be an author and join the greats. I loved cracking open a new book and going somewhere new or learning a new history. My freshman year of high school is when I wrote this book. Boredom struck in math class and I decided to write and write. I kept at it for an entire year, until I finished my little project. I have always been proud of what I have written and always wanted to see it published one day. Throughout the years, I have always been told to follow my dreams and push for anyone with a dream to follow it. You never know where life may take you and the surprises it holds in store. I stuck to my dream and I hope to continue following it. When I am not writing however, I enjoy; singing, dancing, reading, and learning guitar or playing on the beach.", "related": [], "rank": 4504525, "title": "Draconia Rises eBook", "author": "Angel Valentine", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But, because his father was disinherited for choosing the 'cowardly' profession of clergyman, the author was brought up and educated in southern England. During the war he was an officer in the Royal Navy (actually a 'torpedo pilot' in the Fleet Air Arm) and in 1943 both decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross and captured. After 2 + years as a German P.O. W., he became an administrator in the British Colonial Service, working primarily in Malaysia and Singapore. There, he met and worked amongst simple people comparable to our ancestors of 1000 years ago. He was deeply impressed by how vastly different human beings are in different times and places and by the utter fallacy of the assumption that all men are, and always have been, the same. He was honoured as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1960 and later served in Aden and the Bahamas.", "related": ["B007DQ0VW6"], "rank": 2014974, "title": "King-Born: The life of Olaf the Viking, King of the Danes and King of England.", "author": "Ian Fraser", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

OK, fair question—seriously, a wine book from a BYU grad? Yup! Peter went to Wall Street for a time after college and began his career in health care finance. Eventually, after helping start a couple of healthcare businesses, he took some time off. With his then-fiancée Delinda (now his lovely wife) he opened Indulge Bistro & Wine Bar in Highlands Ranch, CO in the fall of 2008. Prior to opening the restaurant, Peter and Delinda took a nine-week intensive Wine & Spirit Education Trust Level 2 wine course, which they both passed with flying colors. The cost of the wine class was US$900 each and it was really hard and not fun at all. So Peter and Delinda decided that there had to be a better way for people to learn about wine, who wanted to do so for pleasure rather than taking a course meant for those who intended to be in the business of wine. Peter hired John Benson as the general manager and wine director for Indulge in early 2009 and credits John for a big part of why the Indulge Bistro & Wine Bar restaurants (a second location opened in Golden, Colorado in May 2012) and their Indulge Wine School have been so successful. John was our first Wine School instructor and has, as of mid-2012, personally taught more than 2,000 students the Wine 101 course.  John Benson, prior to his stellar restaurant career, was a rock star—well, not as well-known as most, but he did live the rock-and-roll lifestyle for some time! He was fortunate to play shows with Perry Farrell from Jane’s Addiction, The Chemical Brothers, 2 Live Crew, and DJ Swamp (Beck’s DJ), among others. Pretty cool. For some reason, John decided to leave the music scene and begin a career in the hospitality industry. John started his career in St. Louis, Missouri, and quickly rose to become headwaiter and sommelier at an upscale French restaurant, Chez Leon. After several years learning traditional French food and wine culture at Chez Leon, John and his now-wife Megan moved to Denver. In Colorado, John received his sommelier certificates from the International Sommelier Guild and the Court of Master Sommeliers. He took his first job in Denver as sommelier at Kevin Taylor’s at the Opera House, where he hosted large wine events for celebrities and special occasions. After a while, John found himself running the Indulge restaurants for Peter and Delinda, and he has never been happier.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is a deep story here, and while there is a love affair, this book\nis much more of a thriller, mixing intrigue and politics with the\nromance. Set\nagainst the backdrop of the modern middle-east, After Ilium contrasts the old\nagainst the new in multiple ways throughout the story. Historical Ilium of the\nTrojan era is viewed through the eyes of the young history buff and\ntourist, Alex Parris as he tours Turkey and Greece, and we see the modern\ncities that thrive there now. The contrast of old against new provides a\nvivid tapestry that holds the reader. . . .The way\nSwartz weaves the complex web of both Alex's dreams of ancient Ilium and his\ndrugged memories of what happened to him after he met Elena is engrossing,\nand I found it hard to put down. This is\nnot a romance novel in any way. The mystery of what happened to Alex and how\nhis love of the history of Ilium led to his predicament is at times violent and\ngritty. I\nreally enjoyed this book. There is no fluff here, just good, solid adventure,\nwell-written and engrossing. After Ilium is a book that I would read\nagain! Posted by Connie J Jasperson", "related": [], "rank": 4489790, "title": "AFTER ILIUM", "author": "Stephen Swartz", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Written by the author ofMen in Nursing: History, Challenges and Opportunities, it was created at the request of numerous colleagues for a book that addressed the practical needs and concerns of men throughout their nursing career journey.The text presents the numerous career paths available in nursing along with a consideration of their financial benefits, job security, personal fulfillment, and the need for nurses who are adept at information management and high tech-skills. The history of nursing is discussed through biographies of nine remarkable male nurses, offering much needed historical role models. The guide discusses strategies for dealing with a rigorous nursing curriculum compounded by the challenges of anti-male sentiment that is sometimes present. It takes the reader from day one of nursing school through the licensing exam and also addresses the specific needs of second-degree and accelerated program students. The book discusses the obstacles that may result from cross-gender nursing communication and relationships with a focus on teamwork. Also covered are professional development and leadership concerns in light of criticism from some women that men advance for self-serving reasons or ?on the backs? of women colleagues.Key Features:Discusses how to navigate the rigors of nursing school along with strategies for successExplains how cope with anti-male sentimentDescribes how to create an application that stands out from the packHelps male students to boost caring skills and touch patients in ways that reflect professionalism, empathy, and skillIncludes helpful advice for landing a first job\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It will be useful for both the church and the academy. I recommend it highly.\" --James H. Cone, Union Theological Seminary, New York City\"In this second edition of James Evans's seminal work, the theology of the Black Church emerges as a unique, relevant, and dialogical response to the realities of this present age.

Most people don't read introductions anyway. I wrote this book because it's the book I wish I had when I began writing many years ago now. It would've saved me decades of effort and made me far more productive. As it was, I had to discover this method on my own, but I'm so glad that I did. If you're just starting out on your path of writing, first of all, welcome! And secondly, the book you have in front of you is filled with unusual ideas that actually work, simple steps to take that will save you rivers of time and keep you far from countless storms of frustration. Everything here has been tested for years, over and over, by my students, fellow writers, and friends. It might seem stupidly obvious once you see what this technique is all about, but for many writers, it's still a mystery. I know it was for me, as well as all my writing students I've worked with for a decade now. They would struggle with their first drafts, often giving up entirely on what they started. But then this one simple step changed everything for them, as it did for me. Now I want to share it with you. What is it? It's just this: Tell, Don't Show. Despite what you've been told, Showing is NOT the best thing a writer can do. It is ONE thing a writer can and should do, but only at the right time or thereafter. That time is absolutely NOT during your first draft. Why not? I could lead you by the brain through pages and pages of explanations, and share with you personal stories of many dozens of writers whose work was transformed by this one tiny technique. But because I believe it's best for you to get started doing this yourself, I've purposely kept this book brief. Nevertheless, here's a short summary of why Showing is not a good thing in your first draft: It's too easy to get tangled up in long descriptions and lengthy passagesYou can quickly lose sight of the big picture of your story, which, for many writers, is a story-killerYour creativity gets stifled when you nitpick over the detailsYou break your flow, your word count plummets, and it's difficult to get started againOn the other hand, by Telling, you will be opening up your creative rivers of thought as you write down everything as it comes through. By not bottle-necking it (which is what happens when you inevitably tense up while trying to Show your scenes in your first draft), you'll expand these rivers of inspiration so much, and in the process, many more stories and details and ideas will come to you. In addition to that, you'll find that your speed of writing accelerates dramatically when you stop Showing during your first draft. As Ray Bradbury stated so elegantly in his book Zen in the Art of Writing, \"In quickness is truth.\" The more we hesitate and cogitate over our writing, the less honest it is, and the less we actually write. What I'm sharing in this book is a simple and unforgettable skill that you'll be able to start using today. There's nowebinar or classes or lengthy books to first be paid for and digested. I speak for myself and for everyone whom I've taught this technique to: there's no going back. You won't want to. Your writing will never be the same once you begin doing this.", "related": ["B0056HP0WA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.2353, "rating_total": 72.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The background, environmental motivation and control challenges associated with hybrid vehicles are introduced. The text includes mathematical models for all relevant components in the hybrid power train. The power split problem in hybrid power trains is formally described and several numerical solutions detailed, including dynamic programming and a novel solution for state-constrained optimal control problems based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Real-time-implementable strategies that can approximate the optimal solution closely are dealt with in depth. Several approaches are discussed and compared, including a state-of-the-art strategy which is adaptive for vehicle conditions like velocity and mass.Two case studies are included in the book:·        a control strategy for a micro-hybrid power train; and·        experimental results obtained with a real-time strategy implemented in a hybrid electric truck·        .Optimal Control of Hybrid Vehicleswill appeal to academic researchers and graduate students interested in hybrid vehicle control or in the applications of energy management using optimal control. Practitioners working in the design of control systems for the automotive industry will also find the ideas propounded in this book of interest.Advances in Industrial Controlaims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "Thijs van Keulen", "author": "Bram de Jager", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It  takes care of the royal family and has a special affinity for the youngest princess, Celie, having helped her thwart an attempted coup in Tuesdays at the Castle (Bloomsbury, 2011). On her way to her lessons one Wednesday, Celie is led up a spiral staircase to a roofless tower containing a large egg. The Castle clearly wants it kept secret, so only Celie is present when it hatches to reveal a mythical griffin. Despite repeated attempts to tell her parents about it, the Castle prevents her from revealing its existence to all but her oldest brother, Bran; the Royal Wizard; and Pogue Parry, a family friend. With their help, Celie cares for the griffin, dubbed Rufus, and explores the Castle's history and connection to the animals. Complicating their search is the Castle's recent spate of potentially dangerous changes and the arrival of a mysterious wizard. There is plenty to charm readers in this second book in the series. The excitement of raising (and riding!) a griffin will entice readers, and Celie continues to be a plucky, capable heroine. The Castle is a character in its own right, and readers will be fascinated to learn more about its history, but they will have to wait until the next book for answers to the many mysteries raised by the revelation of its origins.–Amanda Raklovits, Champaign Public Library, ILα(c) Copyright 2013.

I saw the words, with the phrase \"worst day\" crossed out, in my head one morning before rising.

I wanted this story to be exactly that. A boy and a girl who'd never seen each other as a romantic interest before yet find in each other something rare and precious.But I also wanted it to be a story of a boy and a girl whose biggest obstacle to finding each other is themselves. Daphne with her disbelief that anyone would find in her something precious and to be loved. Carter with his fears that he'd not be enough.It is for teens I write YA. Not for the adults. If Mom and Dad enjoy it, then that's great. If their daughter can read it to them and not be embarrassed, that's even better. But the best compliment comes when the girl says to me, \"I want a boy just like him.\" And I say, you can have him, sweetheart. Somewhere out there is a Timothy Cooper, a Jackson Phillips, and a Carter Pruitt just for you. Never give up believing that.Suzanne D.

He began his nearly life-long love of computers at age 7, when he became one of four students chosen to take part in his school district's pilot computer program. A year later, he was the only participant left! The first computer Frank owned was a Timex Sinclair 1000 in 1982, on which he wrote a program to look up movie times for all of Long Island (and without the 16k expansion module!). After that, he moved on to a Commodore 64 and spent about 4 years doing nothing but assembly programming (games mostly). He finally got his first IBM-compatible PC in 1987, and began learning the finer points of programming (as they existed at that time!).Frank has primarily developed web-based applications for about 8 years. Before that, he developed Windows-based client/server applications in a variety of languages. Frank holds numerous certifications including SCJP, MCSD, CNA, i-Net+, A+, CIW, MCP, and numerous BrainBench certifications. He is a contributor to a number of open source projects, including DataVision, Struts, PocketFrog, and Jakarta Commons. In addition, Frank has started two projects: Java Web Parts and The Struts Web Services Enablement Project. He also was one of the founding members of a project that created the first fully functioning Commodore 64 emulator for PocketPC devices (PocketHobbit).Frank has authored various articles on topics that range from integrating DataVision into web apps, to using Ajax in Struts-based applications.

Burch grew up in Greer, SC, and walked to Greer High School--it was across the street from his home. During his high school years, Burch was editor of the school newspaper, \"The Times,\" a member of the golf team and a trainer for the football team.       Burch graduated from Wofford College, where he served as president of the student body, in 1961 and married his high school sweetheart, Margaret Griffin.       After graduating from college, Burch joined the staff of The Greer Citizen, the weekly newspaper edited and published by his father, the late Edd A. Burch. Walter M. Burch, Leland's younger brother, joined the newspaper as advertising manager in 1966.       Burch began his career at The Greer Citizen as sports editor and eventually added the duties of news editor and photography. Burch became editor of the newspaper in 1985 when his father passed away. He took over writing \"Off the Record\", a humorous editorial page column that his father had started in 1942 when he purchased the newspaper.       Over the years, both the newspaper and Burch's \"Off the Record\" columns won numerous awards in SC Press Association annual competitions.       Leland and Margaret Burch joined the First Presbyterian Church in 1961 and raised four sons, Eddie, Joey, Preston and John David. Margaret Burch represented the community on the Greenville County School Board for 20 years, 1982-2002, and served as the first female chairman. For the past five years, she has chaired the Greater Greer Education Foundation.       Leland E. Burch retired as editor of The Greer Citizen in 2008, but has continued to cover Greer High football games for the newspaper.        Burch is a member and past president of the SC Rose Society and the Greer Lions Club. An Elder in the Greer First Presbyterian Church, Burch currently serves on the Foothills Presbytery Nominations Committee. He is a member of the Greer Christian Learning Center board of directors and serves on the Greer Chamber of Commerce Legislative Action Committee.

He has a fascinating story. This is a great story of\nHollywood.      I realize that his death is controversial. I believe\nthat he did not kill himself. Another book out there, that is well written and\nthoughtful, contends that he did indeed commit suicide.\nAlso, I have recently become aware that one of the\nmost knowledgeable George Reeves researchers is saying that he believes that\nBill Bliss was very much a witness to the actual death scene and is far from\nbeing an innocent bystander.      Is there any evidence to support this other theory?\nAbsolutely not. While researching and writing my book I have found that there\nseems to be some professional jealousy out there. Various experts claim to have\nfigured out the truth about the death of George Reeves.\nWell, I consider myself to be an expert; I believe my book tells the truth.      As far as Lenore Lemmon, she has been badmouthed and\ndowngraded\nby numerous authors over the years. The director of the film 'Hollywoodland'\ncalled her a lowlife. None of these people actually saw her for what she was.      She\ntold great stories. She told men what they wanted to hear. In one interview she\ntold of she and George Reeves in a restaurant. She spoke of the usual BS story\nabout how he couldn't get a job. In the restaurant was actor and singer Bing\nCrosby. Other customers ignored Bing and asked George for his autograph. Fine,\nthat's probably a fairly true story, but she also tells of how she and Bing\nwent to baseball games together. This was Lenore Lemmon. She entertained\npeople. She fooled people, including the author of 'Hollywood Murder Mystery', who chose to believe her side of the story.      This is one of the most famous Hollywood murder mysteries and it's\nabsolutely fascinating. It's not just Reeves and Lemmon; it's the powerful head\nof MGM, Eddie Mannix, and the actors and friends surrounding Reeves.      I invite you to read a great story of Hollywood; a\nstory that people still discuss and debate.\nGeorge Reeves, suicide... or murder?", "related": ["B003ZDO3KC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

G.E. Johnson's exposition of the 23rd Psalm in Discovering the Shepherd: A Study of Psalm 23 brings out the deeper meanings behind the verses of this hymn of comfort and confidence which is typically used primarily with funerals. Through a deeper examination of the powerful testimony of the Shepherd, Johnson demonstrates the deep, spiritual relationship that David has with the Lord. Through examination of the original Hebrew text, the hidden meanings are expounded upon and the Provider and Comforter, i.e. the Shepherd, is brought into a fuller light. Discovering the Shepherd: A Study of Psalm 23 goes beyond the typical usage for funerals and digs deeper into the meaning of the relationship between the sheep and the Shepherd. G.E. Johnson has expertly opened up the deeper truths, especially the ones that look at David's background as a shepherd and the reasoning behind his use of the sheep and shepherd metaphor to describe his relationship with the Lord. God's living word is no more profoundly expressed than in this hymn of provision and comfort. What the author has done is to take something that has such a common usage and make it come alive in a new way. He shows that this hymn is even more appropriate for comfort and provision than we have ever understood. Inspiring, accurate and beautifully written, Discovering the Shepherd: A Study of Psalm 23 will bless all who read it and assist them in building a deeper and more meaningful relationship with the Lord and Shepherd.", "related": ["B00GKUGESQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drew grew up in sunny Los Angeles where he was first introduced to the marijuana culture and community. His interest in its many medicinal and recreational uses was the catalyst which caused him to first try marijuana and gain the valuable insight that he possesses today.      His books are aimed toward the recreational user and offer a direct view into the world of using marijuana and enhancing your experiences with it. Drew has over 12 years of experience using marijuana responsibly and effectively; his methods teach readers how to get the most from their marijuana usage whether it is their first time or one hundredth.  With the legality of marijuana usage becoming more mainstream and soon to hit a nationwide level, Drew’s books have become an incredible resource and a portal into the world of recreational marijuana usage Taking a bilateral approach to the often misunderstood and at times enigmatic world of marijuana, the expert author's account of marijuana usage explores just about every angle known to man, as the singular goal of the pro-pot advocate is simply to spread awareness about marijuana and to educate people about all that there is to know about the mystified plant. Throughout the well-researched content of his publications, backed up by years of practical experience in all things related to marijuana usage, the Los Angles-raised author aptly covers both the potential benefits of marijuana usage as well as the potentially harmful effects of it, if it is abused. After all, it is these two extremes (the good and the bad side of marijuana usage) that are a clear cause for the ongoing political quandary surrounding the legalization, or part thereof, of marijuana usage. Drew's literary coverage of marijuana usage currently spans over four publications, with his book titles including: - Stoner Quotes - Speak On It: Celebrity Quotes About Marijuana", "related": [], "rank": 2631195, "title": "Stoner Quotes", "author": "Drew Breeze", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through a misunderstanding on a blind date, Joe is bitten and ends up afflicted with what amounts to a chronic illness. Instead of being graced with the gift of sexual magnetism and brooding appeal, he actually experiences vampire as an existential condition, a spiritual disease as much as a physical one that forces him to ask some difficult questions: what is life worth when you know you're more or less immortal? How do you deal with having something like \"vampire\" forced on you against your will? How will you fit into a judgmental society within which you were already considered somewhat awkward? What do friendships, relationships, connections with family and the attainment of dreams look like on the other side of this malady? Fortunately, Joe is a stubborn fellow with a penchant for raw, hilarious, profanity-laden honesty and a heart that remained alive even after it stopped beating. He's ready to tell the truth about vampires and set the record straight.", "related": ["B00EENE9G0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

God, however, considers this act, and the subsequent immortality that came with it, to be theft. God wants their immortality returned and he deals with their transgression by playing a cosmic sort of chess game with the Edenites!The Last King is part fantasy, romance, religion and history. What an interesting mix for an 11 part series. This was my first time reading a serial novel and I have to say this one was excellent! I can't wait to read the other chapters to this phenomenal storyline.

There is definitely a storyline\nand the setting(s) constructed within the novel go beyond sex.I really enjoyed writing this novel. As an avid reader as well, I know what I like\nand want to read. I do believe there is\na large fan base out there that enjoy erotic, smutty, explicit and detailed sexual\nbooks (with a story line of course) just like me. The idea of the book popped in my head, I sat\ndown and typed the ideas of each of the main characters. Once I decided exactly who each of the\ncharacters would be and how they will come seen on paper, I let my creative\nimagination go to work. Four weeks later,\nI had fifteen chapters and then I paused - for a long time - to finish up college and graduate school. When school was over, I finished\nthe other five chapters and held onto it. Even though I have\nwritten many hot and steamy short stories and novellas, provocative scenes and\npoetry, this is my firstpublishedbaby. This is truly a novel for it is shy of 91,000\nwords. The booklover has not been\ncheated.", "related": ["B009TXWCC8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
