Nepotism, likewise, is universally condemned but seems just as ineradicable. Adam Bellow explains to us why we are so addicted to what we so deplore, and does so in plain English with convincing scholarship. He brings together biology and history in a way that is intelligible to the general reader and challenging to the discipline-bound professional. Nepotism has never looked so good.”-Robin Fox, professor of anthropology, Rutgers University, and author ofKinship and MarriageandEncounter With Anthropology“I readIn Praise of Nepotismstraight through in about a day and a half.

On a somewhat autobiographical note, which Glise uses in her novel, she was given Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper years ago. \"As I moved over the years I would always come across Russell's Journal and face the question, keep it or discard? I could never let it go.\" Her fascination with Russell and other men of the Rocky Mountain fur trade led her to new friendships as she conducted the extensive research essential to historical fiction. \"The more I learned, the more overwhelmed I became by what I didn't know. At one point I had an almost paralyzing fear that I was going to make an honest mistake but, nonetheless, a mistake and I would make a fool of myself. I have met extraordinary individuals over the last few years. They generously shared their knowledge and enthusiasm for this incredible time in our nation's history.\" Her desire for accuracy took her to the original 1838 Rendezvous site near present-day Riverton, Wyoming. \"When I showed up that first summer, I am sure the organizers thought I was more qualified to write 'hysterical' fiction. I was a real greenhorn, as Osborne Russell would have referred to me. The 1838 Rendezvous Association has welcomed me with genuine hospitality over the years. I am looking forward to returning in July to participate in the annual reenactment and sign copies of my novel.\" Glise was born and raised in Texas and moved to Tennessee where she earned a B.F.A. in painting, printmaking and sculpture from the University of Memphis. She met and married her husband at MSU and moved to Newnan, Georgia in 1981. Glise earned a M.Ed. in media education from the State University of West Georgia in 1992. She has worked as a media specialist for six years. After she finished her novel in 1999, she and her family moved to Washington. She presently lives in Olympia, Washington with her husband and daughter. Glise is a member of the American Association of University Women, the American Library Association, Washington Education Association, National Education Association, the Washington Library Media Association, and Women Writing the West. She is also an associate member of the Western Writers of America.

He merges psychological analysis with a keen awareness of kabbalistic relationships as illustrated by the 10sefirot(or spiritual roots) of the Tree of Life. In sharing his findings, he gracefully tempers his academic approach with dozens of examples (taken from patients and congregants, as well as the Bible) that illustrate the links between common and rare psychological disorders and imbalances within the development of what he has termed the \"spiritual genomes\" within all of us. Not for the red-string, pop culture set, this serious examination of psychology and spirituality includes references to and discussions of the ancient and contemporary Jewish sages—including Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon, Maimonides, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan and Rabbi Schneur Zalman—and a wide array of luminaries in philosophy and psychology, such as Hegel and Jung. Those looking for a more intellectually rigorous approach to spiritual self-help and those in the fields of philosophy and psychology will find this a valuable read.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When I first composed this book, I began with the idea of two women, a mother and her daughter, who dealt with the end of their world in two different ways. One clung to her roots, the other embraced a new way of life with the man she fell in love with. As I progressed with my research, however, I began to understand that there was much more to this eventful era than first perceived. The story grew and branched into two sections as I traced Gizeric's inheritors to their last descendant, a young woman named Meridia. I drew upon my musical training to develop this saga into an \"arch form\". The book opens with the murder of Valentinian and the kidnap of his widow and her daughters by the Vandal, Gizeric, who came to Rome to protect them. Fire rules this novel. Gizeric and the Empress embark upon a passionate, secret affair that produces a son. Her daughter, the princess Eudocia, falls in love with Gizeric's son. The Empress is determined to return to Byzantium with her daughter. The arch soars to a peak with the reconciiation of Gizeric and the Empress, then begins the descent in reverse as their inheritors lose the African kingdom, reconcile with Rome, and become citizens of the Eastern Empire.

An ex-pirate, now residing in a New York City apartment and nostalgic for his days as a swashbuckler, builds a model of his old ship, The Laughing Dog, and launches it on the Central Park Sailboat Pond. Soon a retired Queen shows up with her S.S. Uppity Duchess, \"which commenced with utter, reckless, and heedless abandon to race pell-mell around the pond.\" A battle for naval supremacy ensues, complete with miniature cannons and tiny cannonballs whose thunder \"reached a crescendo that could be heard all the way to Harlem.\" A peace treaty is finally brokered as naptime for the elderly rivals approaches, and the two \"Old Retirates\" agree to share the seas. It's a droll concept that Priest handily executes. He woos readers with a combination of perfectly balanced composition, elegant design and amusing touches, from the pensioned pirate's dapper attire (eyepatch, hook and rakish red cardigan festooned with a nautical design) to a gleeful herd of dogs that break free during the battle and run wild \"after years of being cooped up in tiny apartments.\" Timber-shivering fun from start to finish.

Unfortunately, it isn't quite so easy to dismiss Benjamin from her thoughts, so when he asks for her help in redecorating his newly restored London townhouse, Pamela can't resist. Now, with the help of Pamela's tart-tongued, matchmaking friend Lady Amanda Detwieler, who offers herself as the perfect oblivious chaperone, Pamela and Benjamin are given another chance at romance. Pride, stubbornness, and misunderstanding all play their parts in the plot of Lake's latest romance, and although some readers might despair of the tangled relationship between Pamela and Benjamin ever sorting itself out, Lake neatly brings them together in a wonderfully romantic conclusion. With its witty, polished writing, this is just the kind of love story Regency addicts adore.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

We meet her as she's being kidnapped by aCIAagent, who asks her\nto set up a multi-billionaire for possible blackmail.While it seems the main theme breathes as\nclass wars: authority figures, the extreme rich and recognition, there are\nother forces working behind the scenes which wrap the above within its\nconfine.", "related": ["B00LR1ANAS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 27, "rating_average": 4.2963, "rating_total": 116.0}

Perpetual sunshine would be both blinding and devastating. We need the darkness. It is an integral part of the whole.Part of us.Horror stories are a reflection of our darker side. In an age of very real terrors like A.I.D.S., cancer, and terrorism, stories that frighten us can perform a useful function by allowing readers to live out and experience fear in a controlled fashion and deal with horror on their own terms. If it gets to be too much, they can always close the book and put it away. Experiencing horror in this way works as an anxiety release because it is a tangible way to deal with and escape the terrors of modern living.The emotion of horror keeps us in touch with the darker aspects of ourselves while allowing us to confront our own vulnerability and inevitable death. Reading horror is a valve that allows steam to escape when the buildup is too great, yet the fictionality of it gives us an escape from a confrontation that could overwhelm us. It provides a cathartic release without oppressing us with more than we can handle.Too often we shun our dark side in hopes that if we don't see it, it doesn't exist. Yet give us an Ed Gein, Charlie Manson, Ted Bundy, Hannibal Lecter, Jeffrey Dahmer, or any other grisly example of the dark side of human nature, and we express a morbid fascination that borders on frenzy.We can't help but slow down on the highway to gawk at the carnage of another's untimely, messy death or sneak that guilty peek at another's deformity or misfortune.We just have to look.How many Jeffrey Dahmer jokes have we laughed at, then in the same breath said how disgusting it all is.Strange creatures, human beings.Fact is, our dark side is an inescapable part of our makeup. There's a little bit of Hannibal and Jeffrey in all of us, the problem is most of us don't want to acknowledge it.Through the ages, countless spiritual disciplines have urged us to look within ourselves and seek the truth. Part of that truth resides in a small, dark room -- one we are afraid to enter. If we can only push aside the dark door of fear that holds us at bay and rescue the part of our souls that cringes in the dark, we might come to a better understanding of what makes us tick.We have to take this unmentionable part of ourselves out into the light of truth so we can know its nature, because if we are to confront the uncomfortable truth, we must look in the face of the demon and admit that it is in us. When we're finished, we can let the monster crawled back into its dark abyss until the next play time.If you're timid of spirit and afraid of the dark, it's time to take a look at what lies behind your own door of fear so you can glimpse the twisted evil that lies inallof us. Within these pages we can play with it, poke it, and probe it in hopes that we may better understand the wholeness that makes up our being.Who says we can't have fun doing it? After all, the little monsterispart of us.March 1994                                                                            M.P.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When someone poisons Honorius Didius Fustis, a town councilor and the bride's father, on the wedding day, theÂ prospective bridegroom, Gracchus, who's still eager to cash in on the dowry, hires Libertus to prove that the bride-to-be, Pompeia, isn't responsible for parricide, despite her apparent confession. With his standing with the Roman authorities uncertain, the investigator doggedly pursues suspects both inside and outside the dead man's family.

Theresa and her husband live in Whitby, North Yorkshire, where Theresa spent her childhood. Over the years she has acquired an outstanding reputation for her historical novels, particularly those, like Wolf Girl, set on the north-east coast of England. Shortlisted twice for the Carnegie Medal and for the Sheffield Children's Book Award, Theresa takes a keen interest in the area where she lives. Recent visits to Turkey have fuelled her enthusiasm for the ancient mythology of that part of the world.

But after a summer in which his uncles read spooky stories to him in the dark by flashlight, everything changed. Charlie became an avid reader and his grades dramatically improved. Now he understands the positive influence reading for fun can have on a child. He's living proof. Knowing this, Charlie writes with unbridled enthusiasm and imagination.Today Charlie lives in Oxford, Michigan with his wife, daughter (when she visits from college), and two adorable cats. When he isn't writing or reading, he enjoys playing guitar, juggling, and gardening.David Anthony received his first typewriter in the eighth grade and has been banging on keyboards ever since. As a child, some of David's best friends were books. He always loved to read. A friend first inspired him to write, and the steady encouragement of his parents and teachers kept him at it. Today he writes with the passion of his youth. No story can ever be too fantastic, too impossible, too spooky, or too silly.David currently lives in West Bloomfield, Michigan with a patient wife, a semi-patient son, and a demanding dog. At least two of them usually need a haircut. When not writing or reading, David plays tabletop games with his son, engages in social media, and roots for the Detroit Red Wings.Since the publication of their first book in 2003, Charlie and David have given more than 1,000 entertaining and educational book talks at schools and libraries. The duo has spoken at numerous literary conferences and has been featured on radio, television, and in newspapers.

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Douglas MacArthur has hired private eye Toby Peters to recover some incriminating papers that might keep the general from going into public life after the war. The papers, and funds that could help MacArthur finance a campaign, have been stolen by a civilian aide, Andrew Lansing. Meanwhile, Peters is offered the services of another detective, former Pinkerton op Dashiell Hammett, who's hiding out from Lillian Hellman while trying to recover his health so he can enlist in the army. The chase leads the two to Angel Springs, Calif., and to the mysterious and eccentric millionaire, Mr. Pintacki, who has his own ideas about keeping America great, which don't include a general as president. After Peters discovers Lansing's body on Pintacki's property, the crazed tycoon and his goons pursue Hammett and Peters; the latter, at the same time, tries to make time with his former wife and runs afoul of his uptight cop brother Phil. This 13th entry in Kaminsky's ( The Man Who Shot Lewis Vance ) immensely popular series about Peters tries too hard and spreads itself too thin: the background and the effort to establish it are just a little too obvious.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why?Phillips: That's a very-good question, and the\nanswer's simple. The tournament crappie fishermen have to catch the most big\ncrappie they can every day they compete, if they're going to earn any money to\ncontinue to pay their expenses, be able to go to crappie tournaments and be\nable to add some cash to their family's income. They're highly motivated to\nfind the most big crappie they can in the short time they have to fish in a\ntournament - often no more than 1 or 2 days. Question: How long have you been crappie fishing?Phillips: I was fortunate to have a dad who worked\nand lived through the Great Depression. He and my mother were what's known as\n\"close providers.\" Growing up, we were just above the poverty level, but we\nnever knew it. The main reason for the hunting and fishing that we did was not\nonly for sport and fellowship, but to feed our family. In those days, even when\nwe caught small fish, we scored them across the sides, fried them whole and\npulled the meat away from the bone. I always liked catching crappie, but I\nliked eating crappie even more. When my wife and I were at the University of\nWest Alabama, I had a friend named John Holley, one of the best crappie\nfishermen I'd ever known. He and I would fish together on either Friday or\nSaturday. We caught all the crappie we legally could catch and had a fish fry\nfor the other students living in the married students' apartments. During the\nweek, I'd crappie-fish in a creek that was only 5-minutes from campus before or\nafter school and work and catch crappie from the bank to eat in the middle of\nthe week. I guess the best way to explain how long I've been crappie fishing is\nto say I never remember a time when I haven't fished for crappie.", "related": ["B00A39RVWI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The conference in Paris in 2010 brought together many of the world’s leading researchers, and this volume contains a large number of their contributions. It promises to be a foundation document for future work on this promising subject.”—Robert Almgren, co-founder and Head of Research, Quantitative Brokers “Financial markets and High Frequency Trading (HFT) are in the middle of a fierce political and societal debate. The truth is that we do not have firmly established scientific answers. Yet, policy makers must take decisions and it is important to update them with the current understanding coming from experts and academia. This book presents a very good effort at bringing together and confronting the view points of different fields of study. Let’s hope it will serve to encourage a fruitful and necessary discussion amongst all the actors of this important debate.”—Stéphane Tyc, Global Head of Quant Research, Equity and Commodity Derivatives, BNP Paribas “State of the art contributions by the best experts in the field of market microstructure.”—Michel Crouhy, Head of Research & Development, NATIXIS “The growth of electronic trading has greatly increased interest in the microstructure of exchange markets. With the widespread availability of electronic data, empirical researchers have obtained new insights into how high frequency traders supply liquidity and into how buy-side traders can best arrange their trades. The articles in this volume provide excellent entry points to all analysts interested in electronic trading markets.”—Larry Harris, Fred V.

I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s in Northern Germany. My interest in anything automotive started already at a very young age with visits to the Nürburgring with my dad. I also grew up with Mercedes cars in my family and an uncle of mine, who had a small collection of pre-war cars, introduced me at the end of the 1960s to vintage cars. That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B. Later additions were from a 200D fintail, 250SE, 350SL, 300d Adenauer and a 280SE 3.5 Coupe. Mercedes cars became a passion I have kept and further developed throughout the years.", "related": [], "rank": 753802, "title": "Mercedes-Benz W113 Pagoda SL with buyer's guide and chassis number/data card explanation: From the 230SL, 250SL, 280SL to the coach-built versions, updated April 2018", "author": "Bernd S.

We come and go, but the land is always here. And the people who love it and understand it are the people who own it -- for a little while.\"O Pioneers! (1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier -- and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.From the Trade Paperback edition.--Review", "related": ["B004RZGUBM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She lived for a time in Northern Virginia, before God led her into long-term service overseas in Southeast Asia. In late 2013, she returned to Northwest Ohio where she continues to develop a long-standing love of writing. During the time of her service overseas, Julie experienced a deep freeing work of God in her own life. A passage in 2 Samuel became very precious to her during this time. Her first published book,From Captive to Conqueror, is a devotional that came out of her study of that passage. This book is available in both digital and print format. Since then, She has published theKatie Graceseries, consisting of three children's books which are available in digital form, with print versions soon to come. Besides these, Julie has written a number of other works including a Christmas play, a children's musical suitable for churches, and several short skits. She authors a blog. Her writing is intended to either directly share biblical truth or to provide good, clean reading with a positive message.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eventually the aliens realised how pointless this was and, as a failed student, he was returned to Earth and left with a family who brought him up as a human bean. But, the persistent memories of new worlds, dragons and other creatures, continued to knock at his frontal lobe, desperately trying to break out. To avoid making a mess and calm his imagination, Tim began writing as a way to communicate with Earthlings. Fuelled by Chilli and Nachos and a bottle of wine, Tim manages to balance a love of loud rock music and fast cars (preferably red!) with emotional chic flicks, smart leather shoes and a well tailored suit. He has successfully infiltrated the humans and hides behind the façade known as a family. He learns from his children, but is regularly told to stop acting like a child by his wife. Naturally shy and unsociable by nature, he is selective of the human company he keeps, preferring to be around old books, bonsai and art. He cries at 'It’s a wonderful life' but sulks if fed evil vegetables disguised as Parsnips or Peas. He is bored by mundane conversation, excited by architecture and castles and fuelled by Caramel Latte Macchiato's. Occasionally, he likes to catch up with old acquaintances on Tatooine, Westeros, and Middle Earth, and stare at fantasy and concept art as if it is a window to his childhood adventures. He is always trying to learn lessons from the masters; Mr Charles Darwin and Mr Lionel Ritchie, about life and love. Tim's galactic mission is to translate his brain activity into a language that inspires and entertains you, transports you to different worlds and grants you an audience with the characters you have dreamt about, but never dared to remember. All of this in an attempt to redeem himself with his childhood alien abductors and travel the stars once more.", "related": ["B00F0XGEKW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

White leads by example and in faith to serve people and demonstrate the love of Christ.Innovation keeps the meta-church fresh and relevant, yet always grounded by its \"incarnational\" and \"missional\" core values. The idea is to embrace and even encourage diversity among believers, whether through language, ethnicity, worship style, age, or culture--so that the meta-church transcends a place where people gather on Sunday morning. Its members \"are\" the church in their neighborhoods, in the marketplace, and even in the poverty-stricken reaches of Honduras.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My life changed in a big way when I\nmoved to L.A., but in even bigger ways when I started dancing. The catalyst was the Japanese movie \"Shall\nWe Dance?\". I saw it three weekends in a row in 1997 and related very\nstrongly to the protagonist. A local ballroom studio had, very cleverly, left\nbrochures in the theatre lobby. I signed up for lessons, and have been dancing\never since. Ballroom has provided me with many friends, a husband, an athletic\nand competitive challenge, and opportunities to dance in a short film, a\nfeature, and a stage production.In 2012 I pulled all my old writing out of its\nboxes. I'd started writing long-form fiction in graduate school, after writing\nshort stories, poems, and songs earlier in life. I'd never had the urge to try\na novel until I wrote a fictionalized case study for a seminar. I can't\nremember what the seminar topic was, but the case study was concerned with the family\nlife and economics of a Bordeaux winemaker in the 1780s.The resulting historical romance novel,\n\"The Exiles,\" is now available for Kindle and as a paperback here on\nAmazon.  A follow-up novel, \"Discovered\"\nis also now available for Kindle; and a contemporary romance novel, \"Home\nSweet Home,\" is available in both formats. One of the old pieces of writing I had on hand\nwas an unproduced screenplay. I re-wrote the piece as a novella titled\n\"Getting Off.\" During this process, a new set of characters introduced\nthemselves. One thing led to another, and the \"L.A. Stories\" are the\nresult.The L.A. Stories are all novella-length, in a\nmodified teleplay format.

Wherever they go, they find the raw ingredients for success  already present: \"The potential for positive change lies within each  school. Abundance is present in the form of capable children, teachers,  coaches, and principals. Potential energy -- what can be -- transforms  into kinetic energy—what will be—only when a force is accurately applied  to move a school in the right direction.\"InSmall Steps, Big Changes: Eight Essential Practices for Transforming Schools Through Mathematics,  the authors identify eight tested principles that transform what can be  an overwhelming process into a set of comprehensible and concrete  steps. Each phase of the change process is brought to life through the  stories and perspectives of teachers, coaches, and principals—stories  that will strike familiar chords for every educator.When  teachers make sense of math, students learn to make sense of math, and  that can profoundly change the entire culture of a school. In one vivid  illustration, the authors tell the story of Pueblo Gardens Elementary  School in Tucson, Arizona, where Marco, as principal, and Chris, as  instructional coach, worked alongside a group of dedicated teachers. A  few years into the change process, Pueblo Gardens -- a school with 96  percent of its students at the poverty level and a high percentage of  English language learners -- had 94 percent of students meeting or  exceeding state standards in third-grade mathematics. Over time, other  grades achieved similarly high scores. And once the test scores rose,  they were sustained at high levels.", "related": [], "rank": 1458926, "title": "Small Steps, Big Changes", "author": "Chris Confer", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00FZZQEK0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Trabajo en el campo de la salud, pero siempre he disfrutado mucho la lectura y tal vez por eso, me gusta escribir. Es cierto eso que dicen que todo escritor debe ser muy buen lector y considero que las dos cosas van de la mano en mi vida, ya que de pequeña siempre me gusto la lectura gracias a mi mamá, que nos llevaba a cuanto curso de lectura encontraba, porque quería que nos fuera bien en el colegio y también porque pensaba que la lectura daba cultura; y hoy día, pienso que tenía razón. Cuando cumplí 15 años, descubrí una novela llamada \"La novia Cautiva\" entre los libros de mi mamá, que me fascinó. De allí en adelante fue mi lectura preferida hasta que encontré los libros de viajes en el tiempo y me sentí tan atraída por el tema, que empecé a escribir novelas de tipo romántico con tintes paranormales; pero pensaba que no eran muy buenas, así que o las archivaba o las echaba a la basura. Hoy pienso que es una pena que llegaran otras cosas a mi vida y que con la universidad y otras ocupaciones, olvidara mi amor por las novelas y por la escritura hasta que pasados varios años, por una enfermedad muy dura, que me tuvo casi un año sin poder escribir, pensé ¿Porqué no aprovechar el tiempo y escribir lo que me gusta? Y así nada más, me puse en la tarea de averiguar todo lo que necesitaría para publicar o auto publicar mis escritos. Todo curso gratis en Internet que descubría, que me ayudara a mejorar mi escritura o que diera consejos sobre esto, lo hacía. Tomé algunos cuadernos que tenía en el olvido y reescribí algunas partes y otras las corregí.  Escribo mucho sobre romance histórico paranormal o de ficción, me llama la atención el tema de los viajes en el tiempo, aunque también disfruto escribiendo cosas de la vida real, novelas contemporáneas;novelas históricas. En estos momentos tengo dos historias con una trama bastante interesante, la bulimia y el maltrato infantil, muy pronto las estaré publicando y espero de corazón que las lean y las disfruten.", "related": [], "rank": 805380, "title": "Me acuerdo...

This book adjusted my thinking on several scores.”—Jonathan Lethem “In this, perhaps the most important book about the digital age so far this century, Astra Taylor reveals the unacknowledged economic operating system actually running the net. It’s a landscape in which ‘open’ means different things for different people, leisure might better be classified as labor, and the promise of free culture ends up costing us so much more than money.”—Douglas Rushkoff, author ofPresent Shock,Program or Be ProgrammedandLife Inc.  “The scariest book I’ve read in a while is also the most exhilarating:The People’s Platformportrays what the digital age has done to our society, our culture, our lives—the power grabs, the blows to democracy, the uphill rush of money—and how it’s undermined the economic underpinnings of news and art, in broad scope and precise detail. There is no better, no stronger picture of our bleak new technological landscape and the peppy delusions and deceptions of its profiteers. Knowledge is power, and Taylor gives us a picture so clear it empowers us to find a way forward through the debris. Read it and revolt.”—Rebecca Solnit, author of A Paradise Built in Hell “A lively, engaging and wide-ranging look at the politics and the business of the Internet. This is a must-read call to action for anyone who believes in the democratic potential of the net.”—Nora Young, host ofSpark, on CBC Radio “InThe People’s Platform, Astra Taylor skillfully explores and dismantles familiar polarized positions on internet culture. In this unravelling, she reveals the complex and blurred relationships among users, creators and those who profit from them. Taylor’s argument for a sustainable cultural commons is moving and persuasive, and elevates the debate at this crucial juncture in the evolution of cyberspace.”—Jennifer Baichwal, documentary filmmaker (Manufactured Landscapes,Payback,Watermark) “The People’s Platformis a can’t-look-away tour through the bombed-out wreckage of democratic culture in the Internet age. If you’ve ever had the uncomfortable feeling that we’ve taken a wrong turn on the way to the future, Astra Taylor’s shocking, utterly rational, and elegant book will have you shaking your fist along with her.

Telling stories for people to enjoy is one of her greatest joys. Her stories range from adventures appropriate to children to thoroughly adult erotica but they always feature strong characters who do what they think is right no matter what gets in their way. That's not terribly surprising given that Meyari is a similarly strong-willed person who tries to always do the right thing, even when its hard to accomplish. Meyari has been married for just under twenty years and has no children or pets. She lives in the Puget Sound, WA and enjoys the fog, rain and cool weather that are typical here. When vacation times come, she and her husband usually go somewhere warm like Hawaii or they go on their own adventures to Japan and other far away countries. Her life has included jobs ranging from cleaning motel rooms, food service, receptionist, building and editing digital maps, auditing and document control.", "related": [], "rank": 2431859, "title": "The City of the Ladies", "author": "Meyari McFarland", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Are they connected to a seven-year-old incident in which two men vanished from a party held to celebrate the release of a notorious gangster from prison? Fans of the author’s long-running Hennessey and Yellich procedural series should enjoy this book, although they ought to be warned that the Vicary stories are somewhat darker than the usual H&Y fare (the writing is a bit different, too: slightly sparser and more abrupt). Vicary, a cop with some shadows in his own past, is an increasingly interesting lead character, and each book in this new series is better than the last. If this trend continues, expect to hear much more about Vicary and his creator. --David Pitt", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His first fiction book, \"Interstate 10\", was released in January of 2013 to very positive reviews.

For his latest book, \"The Dead Ones\", released in April of 2013, Ken described it as \"sort of a companion piece to 'Interstate 10.'

The attention to detail suggests that the reader is in expert hands. But several more chapters in, the book devolves into a plodding and superficial treatment of two presumably scarred souls seeking redemption in the mountains near Wyoming's Wind River. Much of the novel is a dissertation on wilderness camping and fly fishing, which seems designed more to showcase the author's considerable knowledge of these subjects than to drive a narrative. The inevitable revelation of past secrets doesn't start until two-thirds of the way in, and then spills forth in a single rush of confession, followed by an equally hurried and predictably convenient ending. Even readers who might appreciate the slow-paced exploration of beautiful country will be disappointed in the book's hasty, shallow reflections on confession. Good and evil are carefully contained on separate sides of the track, with no question as to which characters belong where, and therefore little drama in their redemptive moments.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

V. Fesko gives us a study of baptism which joins a treasury of theological citations with strong theological insights. After a survey of the history of the doctrine, Fesko focuses on the Reformed tradition and its important figures and confessions. He indicates the biblical dimensions of the meanings of baptism and provides a positive and constructive statement of its theological truth. This is a valuable work for its mastery of primary sources as well as its clear articulation of the covenantal dimensions which give a Reformed theology of baptism such power and purpose for Christian believers. --Donald McKimJ. V. Fesko s Word, Water, and Spirit is a major work that both models how to do theology by moving from historical theology to biblical and systematic theology and, most importantly, presents fresh insights for a Reformed understanding of baptism. Fesko s fair-minded, page-turning history of the doctrine of baptism is itself worth the price of the book. Most enlightening, however, is his biblical-theological survey of baptism as new creation, covenant judgment, and eschatological judgment. The book s emphasis on God s judgment in baptism is particularly innovative and helpful. These insights pave the way for treating baptism systematically as a means of grace and as a sacrament in relation to its recipients and ecclesiology. Highly recommended for all who wish to grapple seriously with the doctrine of baptism and its implications. --Joel BeekeWonderfully Reformed . . . John Fesko shows the fruitfulness of reflecting on baptism as a marvelously robust doctrinal statement. He is to be commended for his first rate, deep theological thought on the core sacrament of our faith. --William H.

Well written, suspenseful and loaded with lots of speculative ideas about robotics. I assume that these ideas are all here now or within a possibility. I REALLY enjoyed reading this book... His best yet. I rate this one at 5 stars.\" - Allan MacDiarmid \"The plot is very tightly done and goes from blackmail to industrial espionage to murder, to domestic terrorism and a plot to divert highly sensitive military secrets to hostile nations without any seams or glaring \"drop offs\" of narrative.  And the denouement chase scene is well-crafted and tense without going over the top at any time... The story rolls along quickly and doesn't have any slow spots or info dumps that can plague near-future SF quite often.  The concepts of science are woven into the narrative and serve to convey the \"differentness\" of the future, without taking over the plot.  I thoroughly recommend this book.  You will not be disappointed.\" -Brian Proctor \"A steamy sex scene, a kidnapping and the start of an investigation into black mail, espionage and intrigue.  An interesting story of the not too distant future with autonomous autos, robots and the effect they will have on our society.  Quite different from Steven's earlier stories but definitely an exciting criminal investigation story set in a realistic near future.

My name is Kay Kinghammer and I am a poet. I wrote my first poem when I was fourteen, for my parent’s thirteenth anniversary. My mother was not pleased with my mathematical error! I didn’t write again until college. Recently, I retired from my position at the University of Washington and have devoted my time and energy to being a full time poet. In the last year, I have been published in Granny Smith Magazine; Prospective - A Journal of Speculation volumes 3, 4, and 5; Electric Windmill Press; Mad Swirl Poetry Forum; Perspective Magazine; and Pacific Poetry. I was one of the original organizers/readers at Red Sky Poetry Theater and at Campus Poets and Writers. I am also a graduate of Clarion West (1984) Professional Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Workshop.  I was a member of the Mercer Street Poets, it was one of the most prolific and joyous times in my life. Mercer Street Poets was a community of women poets, who critiqued each other’s work and did occasional readings. I have been a featured reader at the Whidbey Island Poetry Festival, and in 1992 at, the Seattle Music and Literary Arts festival, Bumbershoot. My work can be heard at Breadline, a monthly reading series here in Seattle in July 2013, and at the Fermoy Poetry Festival in County Cork, Ireland in August 2013.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My name is Roberto Calas (pronounced kah-LASS, with the accent on the last syllable) and I am an author of fantasy and historical fantasy. I live in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Yes, that Sandy Hook.\nIf you are interested in picking up additional tidbits about my novels or writing or life in general, my blog can be found at http://robertocalas.com/.\nI’m a voracious reader and have been since I was a wee one. The landscapes of fantasy and science fiction were my usual haunts, but as I grew I developed a keen interest in history as well, particularly medieval history.\nWhen I was fairly young, maybe nine or ten, I accidentally set fire to my best friend’s living room while adding burned edges to a fantasy map we had made. Somehow my love of fantasy survived that calamity and I continued to write stories about fire giants and knights. Okay, I kind of gave up on the fire giants. But definitely still writing about knights.\nI graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in Journalism and a concentration in Creative Writing, and went on to work as a reporter for a large Connecticut daily. I realized fairly early that newspaper reporting wasn’t so much ‘writing’ as it was filling space in as unimaginative a way as possible. I spent three years chained to an oar aboard and advertiser-driven barge, with angry editors lashing whips and shouting. So I escaped and moved on to magazine writing and editing, which was more pleasant sailing, but it was still a long way from writing the stories that I had spent my childhood inventing.\nI row my own boat now. Yeah, the metaphor is wearing thin. I have written two novels,The Scourge(published by 47North) andThe Beast of Maug Maurai.A couple other things about me:\nMy fiancee lives in the UK. I am father to twins. I can juggle. I fenced competitively though college. I used to own a sword/historical reproductions company. I have a pilot’s license. I hate spiders. I love fireplaces and hot chocolate. Love fighter jets. I love castles and knights. Love sleep. Love snowstorms and thunderstorms. Love twizzlers and Coke. Absolutely love to go to the movies. Love forests and mountains. Love the moon when it’s full or when it’s a tiny crescent. Love reading. Love drawing. Love telling stories. With the amount of evidence my friends have, I could never, ever run for president.", "related": ["B00L6CTWBE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I often wrestle with\nquestions such as :Why do people do what they do?What motivates them?How is it that they don't realize the impact\nthey cause on others?As a child, it is natural to be pushy in\nhaving our survival needs met and lack empathy as to how one's behavior\nimpacts others or  to see that others may have different views.\nYet, as I developed into an increasingly introspective woman, I realized\n that lack of empathy can go beyond the first stages of life.\nObserving my mother's tactics was an important source of\nquestions. I wanted to know why she did not understand that her harsh\napproaches were making me less likely to abide by her rules. She was\nunconsciously fueling my rebellion, while hoping to instill docility.And so I embarked on an intellectual journey aimed at answering these questions...My\n extensive study of psychology, systems theory and conflict theory have\nall shaped my radical understanding of today:We are all interconnected,\n but struggle with recognizing this bond, because relationships come\nwith pain tied to vulnerability and emotional transparency, the\nquintessence of close relationships.Yet, the truth\nremains that human connection is the hallmark of humanity. The rise of\nindividualism in our culture belies this fact to our detriment,\npreaching that independence is the model to emulate. But our need for\nconnection is has been demonstrated and\nmanifests perpetually in society.  I believe that\nmy empathetic approach of studying both sides of a toxic relationship\nenhances our conceptualizations of love, marriage and relationships.\nHuman connection is a direct path toward growth, helping in the\nacquisition of life lessons such as empathy, patience, love and\nforgiveness.I hope that my message resonates with you.", "related": ["B004OL25XG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After losing my brother in an aviation accident, I was painfully reminded that no matter how good or skilled we might consider ourselves, if we become complacent in remaining fundamentally grounded in the basics of our craft, our craft will one day expose our weakness. Applying Band-Aids may cover problems temporarily, but relentlessly applying the fundamentals will cure problems permanently.This book is about being a Target Leader on and off the job. Target Leaders inspire others to stay true to their core values and principles, no matter how tempting the easier road might be. Temptations to make the wrong choice knock constantly, yet the opportunity to make the right choice knocks only once. Target Leaders are not perfect, but they inspire the best decisions possible. They listen to understand, not argue. They are eager to hear valuable input that will make a process or environment safer, better, or more productive. They look inward for guidance, admit their mistakes, and take positive action to bring people together for the good of the organization. And what's good for the organization is great for its people.", "related": [], "rank": 1236412, "title": "Target Leadership", "author": "Jeff \"Odie\" Espenship", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a pure blood Werewolf who had not Changed by the time he hit his 18th birthday--but remained stubbornly human. And he was still a friggin virgin! The only bright spot in his life was his hunky college roommate he got to eye rape every night when Chad fell asleep. But when a 3 word handwritten letter arrives from Joshua's father: \"Keep The Secret,\" Chad starts to pressure Joshua to reveal what his family Secret is. And Chad isn't afraid to use his body as the bait to find out. Joshua knows the penalty for revealing The Secret--that Werewolves are real. The penalty is Death. How far will Chad go for an answer? How badly does Joshua want to lose his virginity? Better dead than a virgin, right? Or at least that's what an 18 year old college freshman might think. (An adults only story featuring a very hot to trot Werewolf to be and an extremely flexible roommate who feels \"labels are so twentieth-century\" when it comes to sexuality. Get ready for a major steamy college dorm romp with the most sex-starved Werewolf you've ever read about and what it's like to suddenly have your dreams come true. Explicit sex scenes of all sorts within a Supernatural context.)Excerpt:I sat down on the bed next to him and kicked up my charm to Nova level. I knew from experience it could melt the panties off girls. \"Let's make a deal,\" I said in a conspiratorial tone. \"Tell me your secret and I'll give you a kiss.\"\"What?\"\"Josh, I've known you were gay since we met during Orientation. I can feel your eyes on me all the time. I even started sleeping in just my boxers because I could watch you tent your pants. No biggie. So--I know you've wanted to kiss me. Here's your chance. Trade you a kiss for your secret.\"JoshuaShit, if he had offered me a blow job, I'd out every Supe in the state. I had already identified a Werepanther who was in the front row of Pugmire's class. You can always tell a Werepanther from the smell. But keeping the Secret was something we were raised with from the time we could talk. After the major massacres in the 1600s, most Supes went underground and had signed treaties to keep the Secret. There were Enforcers who took out chatty Cathy Supes--or at least, that's what we were told. I had never met one. Maybe they were our version of boogie men.\"No,\" I said firmly. \"And is it that obvious I'm gay?\"\"Well, yeah. It's like your eyes end up velcroed to every guy's crotch or ass. I think it's funny.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having taken voluntary redundancy in 1981, he was released after the 1982 Falklands War, and trained as a roof thatcher in Dorset. In 1984, the murder of his beloved aunt and mentor Hilda Murrell led him to examine and then challenge the hazards of nuclear electricity generation. This, plus the break-up of the Soviet Union, followed by the 1991 Gulf War caused him to speak out against nuclear weapons, the first ex-Commander with nuclear weapons experience to do so.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She also calls for better care and social support for those living with the disease. Lock (An Anthropology of Biomedicine), McGill University professor of social studies of medicine, states that the stubborn conundrum of the most commonly diagnosed subcategory of dementia is that its biology, causes, and risk factors aren't very well understood. Lock proves that the science of the disease is just as compelling as poignant accounts from caregivers and those suffering with Alzheimer's disease. Lock highlights just how much we don't know, from problems with Alzheimer's pathology, testing, and diagnosis to the search for a drug treatment. The number of times the word ˜uncertainty' has been used in this book is remarkable, she notes. While science plugs away at solving the Alzheimer's conundrum, Lock's call for improved care and social support takes on a new urgency.

Along the way, he became the minister for the Sunday Praise Service, selecting the music and order of worship, leading the music with voice and guitar, and sharing preaching duties with the pastor and several other church members.

However, I learned many new techniques to relax\nmy eyes, something that I need as I work long hours in front of a PC,\nthe video link for eyes yoga was definetely a great bonus of this book\nand relaxation techniques that the book suggests brought me an immediate\n relief...After reading several of Mr. Mc Cloud's books,  I realized\nwhat they all have on common: the author stresses the importance of\nprevention and taking responsability for one's healh..the best strategy\nfor me, !

So I write and write, not looking to get rich but if you have enjoyed my work, then it was time well spent. My imagination has been placed into words for all to enjoy!

Although it would be interesting to say I spend my time exploring exotic destinations and drinking wine from barrels in Tuscany, that is not the case.  I live in the real world.  Currently, my days are spent working in the ever exciting world of bookkeeping.  Night time for me does not mean breaking into the Smithsonian to steal the hottest work of art to sell on the black market.  In fact, the only work of art I’ll see will be created by one of my awesome kids while they’re doing anything possible to keep from getting in bed on time.  As with every other small town girl, I have dreamed of breathtaking adventures and schmoozing with the elite.  I actually managed to make it about two thousand miles and a few months before realizing that the big city lights are better left to big city girls and my wild imagination.  No adventure is as fulfilling as being wrapped in the strong arms of my love while surrounded by the laughter and arguing of our not so little ones. R. L.

It is full of human insights, and it has a deep understanding of successful leadership, an appreciation of selflessness as the key to our collective future, an awareness of history's relevance to our lives and an unflinching emphasis on excellence. Siong Guan Lim is one of the most outstanding public servants in any country, and after finishing this book, you will know why.\" -- Senator Bill Bradley, Former U.S. Senator and a Managing Director at Allen & Co, United States of America\"The Leader, the Teacher and Youis a riveting and thoughtful study on leadership based on theory, principles, and experience by a former Head of the Civil Service and one of Singapore's most successful and admired public servants, Siong Guan Lim. It should be read by every student of politics and public policy, and anyone who aspires to play a leadership role.The book, which as the author says is \"part biography, part commentary, and part exposition\", is loaded with insights into how to work with people, deal with reality, motivate an organisation, achieve results, anticipate change, and ensure relevance of the organisation.For those who have long puzzled over how Singapore has been able to achieve so much with so little and in short time, it is public servants such as Siong Guan Lim who have made the partnership between the civil service and the elected politicians so fruitful. Through his fascinating account of how he started in his first job as an engineer in the Sewerage Department, went on to be the Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, worked with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee, and became successively Permanent Secretary of Defence, Education, and Finance, he recounts the crucial mentorship and inspiration provided by Singapore's leaders. He thoroughly examines what true leadership is all about. Lim moved on to become Chairman of Singapore's Economic Development Board and then Group President of GIC Private Limited, the wealth fund of Singapore.I have not read such a clear analysis of the function of leadership written so succinctly and in such practical terms. It should be on the required reading list of university courses not only in Singapore, but major universities everywhere.\" -- Professor Chan Heng Chee, Chairman, Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities, Singapore University of Technology and Design Singapore\"A remarkable book…after I started reading it I simply couldn't put it down. It has great insights, is fun to read, and deserves to be widely read. It is full of practical wisdom for a wide range of people — from full time mums to business leaders. It sets out a framework for leaders based on values and culture, but also on lessons learned by having to take tough decisions. Siong Guan Lim had an outstanding career in the development of Singapore. The ability, motivation, and vision of the author and his colleagues are clearly one reason why Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew were so successful. Because of this the book is a great insight to understanding the phenomenon of Singapore.\"--Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach, Vice Chairman, Goldman Sachs International, United Kingdom\"Siong Guan Lim has led and managed at the most senior levels of the Singaporean government. Any leader would love to have him at his/her side, advising, counselling, provoking, and reminding. We cannot have him with us in person, but we do have this book that extracts the lessons that he has garnered from his many years of experience. We are fortunate that he has chosen to share his wisdom in writing.I have used some of his wisdom in my Harvard Kennedy School course on Effective Implementation for more than ten years. It has stood the test of time. Now, with the advent of the book, I will borrow even more from him. My students and I are grateful.\"--Mr Francis Hartmann, Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy and Originator of the Kennedy School course on Effective Implementation, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, United States of America\"This book is truly unique: it is written and packaged like the numerous self-help books on leadership with tips and challenges, but its objective is not to teach someone how to get ahead and be successful by learning leadership techniques.At its heart is a simple and yet profound message — that to lead, one has to inspire people to aspire beyond themselves. Messages like 'at the heart of every human being is a desire for meaning and purpose in life' is a call for true values-based leadership, and a selflessness that is reflected by the book's fundamental premise: to be a good leader, one has to be a great teacher.Through examples from his own very public record of service to the nation and written in a way that is very accessible to young people, Siong Guan Lim is himself a teacher-leader.The one message that resonates through the book is his observation that 'time passes and people die, but principles and values are what live on.' Young Singaporeans should absorb the book's messages into their daily lives, and by so doing they will become the selfless teacher-leaders, which Siong Guan Lim is the best example of.\" -- Mr Ho Kwon Ping and Ms Claire Chiang, Founders, Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts, Singapore\"We live in a wicked world. The conventional wisdom is that, in order to succeed, one has to be ruthless and unprincipled. Siong Guan Lim's extraordinary success is proof that a man with deep religious convictions and high moral principles can be a successful leader. What is Siong Guan Lim's leadership style? He is a leader with a tough mind and a warm heart, a leader who teaches and develops those who are members of his team. This is a wise and inspiring book.\" -- Professor Tommy Koh, Chairman, Centre for International Law, National University of Singapore, Singapore\"As a life-long student of philosophy, I have been struck how scarce wisdom is in our world, even though it has been revered throughout the ages. This is why Siong Guan Lim's book is special. It is probably one of the wisest books I have read about the Singapore experience. At the same time, its principles have universal applicability. Hence, I have no doubt that every reader will benefit from reading it. And the world will become a better place if his wise insights are universally applied.\" -- Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, and author of The Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One World, Singapore\" Siong Guan Lim's book is a fascinating and uplifting read. He evolves an original exposition on the many facets of leadership from his more than 30 years of distinguished public service to Singapore. I recommend it as essential reading for managers be they placed in the private or public sector. Of greatest relevance to me personally was 'Part I: The Teacher' culminating in the chapter on 'Culture and Values' — valuable for those of us leading organizational change and development. Siong Guan's conviction that today's challenges demand values-driven solutions resonates sharply and persuasively. This book is organized to lovingly teach you how to lead yourself and your people to be the best that everyone can be.\" -- Mr Philip Ng, Chief Executive Officer, Far East Organization, and Chairman of the Singapore University of Technology and Design Board of Trustees, Singapore\"An extensive collection of great quotations and life principles by Siong Guan Lim has provided me with personal inspiration and valuable professional insights as a CEO of a company whose continued success depends on its people. As every principle is intelligently articulated, reading this book will surely motivate and encourage all leaders.--Mr Takeshi Niinami, Chief Executive Officer of Lawson, Inc, Japan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is Starla's passion and desire to give back what has been given to her through some of life's most difficult moments.  In her own words:  \"There is enough negative in the world, so it is my desire to spread something positive, to be a soft spot to land, a safe place for people to visit.  No matter the difficulty, and regardless of the obstacles in life there is always a choice - those obstacles can be roadblocks or stepping stones!  That is my message of hope and the reason I encourage you to 'never give up' no matter what comes your way.  You can do this!  It all starts and ends deep inside your own heart.  Believe in yourself… You are a treasure and YOU ARE LOVED!!!\" Encouragement Enterprises uses their website, Starla's blog page and social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and You Tube to provide this message of hope to a global community.       Starla invites everyone to join the “encouragement movement” with the belief that each life can make a difference in the lives of others.  Her message in a nutshell is “Together we can change a moment, change a day, change a life!” Born and raised in the South, Starla considers herself a true \"southern belle.\"  You might hear her say the word \"ya'll\" and if you sit down for a visit with her, she would most likely offer you a glass of sweet iced tea.  Starla lives near her family along the sunny Gulf Coast of Alabama.  Aside from writing, speaking and other  outreach endeavors, she enjoys entertaining and cooking for family and friends.  Her favorite past-time in the fall is college football.  In spring and summer, she enjoys tending to her vegetable garden.  Starla shares her southern experiences in a blog entitled \"Southern Drawl.\"  While writing is her passion, Starla also has a great love of music.  She comes from a musical family and even began her time in college on a piano scholarship.   She has been active in music endeavors since age 9.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
