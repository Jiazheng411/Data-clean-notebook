Shattered by her mother's death, 14-year-old Jackie Delham is left to bring up her two younger siblings and run the household for her grief-stricken father. When Jackie's dad finds love two years later with Bradleyville's prodigal daughter-the svelte, dressed-to-the-nines Katherine May King-Jackie rather predictably opposes their romance. But love is waiting in the wings for her, as well. Teen idol Greg Kostakis, lead singer of the boy band \"LuvRush,\" is distantly related to Katherine, and not too many pages elapse before Jackie and Greg are infatuated with each other, despite his busy concert schedule. As Jackie explores the complications of romance, she cultivates empathy for her father and Katherine as they come to grips with demons from their pasts. The slangy eastern Kentucky dialect spoken by the characters is uneven (characters sometimes drop their \"g\"s at the end of words and sometimes don't), but the characterizations are interesting, and Collins pens some worthy descriptions. Readers of the first two books in the series will recognize various characters, but the novel succeeds well as a stand-alone. Although the book is ostensibly aimed at adult fiction readers, the novel's contemporary setting, teen protagonist and happily-ever-after ending should cinch its success with the YA crowd.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From beginning to end Moevs compels us to rethink Dante's poem.The Metaphysics of Dante's Comedyis a remarkable book and a major contribution to our understanding ofCommedia. --Warren Ginsburg, University of Oregon\"Christian Moevs has written the first truly comprehensive account of Dante's metaphysics. All the theories about creation, separate substances, relation between the intellect and the world of contingencies are finally put in their proper relationship with his poetic vision.  This fresh, careful, and lucid examination of three notoriously complex cantos of Paradiso (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXIX) dismantles formalist accounts of the poem and it amounts to a persuasive argument in favor of its deeper theology.\"--Giuseppe Mazzotta, Charles C. and Dorathea S.

A text written with elegance, verve, and precision, which one cannot put down until the end.\"--Il Sole-24 Ore\"This is a wonderful book, integral, ordered, developed, culminating, like Dante's poeticized universe, in the point of it all, the apprehension of Being.  Moevs writes beautifully: he is clear--elegantly clear--in a prose that nonetheless expresses complex ideas.  This is a major contribution that makes us appreciate how, in Dante, being relates to Being. One of my colleagues told me that he considered this a dangerous book.  I told him that I considered that one of its strengths. Insisting on, even magnifying, the metaphysical/mystical side of Dante, Moevs is trying to set the Commedia into relation with other great thinkers and other religions.\"--Robert Hollander, Emeritus Professor in European Literature, Princeton University\"It would be difficult to summarize all the lines of dazzling argument presented by Moevs...The implications of these principles for reading theCommediaare explored through senstive close reading, leading to fresh interpretations of passages from all threecantiche.  The consequences of Moevs' analysis of Dante's metaphysics not only bear upon readings of individual passages.

Ryan owns a construction company who often gets his hands (and the rest of him) dirty by working with his crew.As Dare and Spencer face individual heart wrenching sorrows, they're brought together by a very special little boy – Ryan's young nephew, JC.Trouble seems to follow Dare like a shadow. His goodhearted nature and sincere desire to help his fellow man seems to continually backfire on him, leading to situations that are both dangerous and discouraging. Through it all, Ryan and JC become his haven, the lifelines that keep him from drowning.In Dare To, AKM Miles gives us an incredible novel of hope and love that reminds the reader that love's sweetness can temper the most bitter of experiences. Dare and Spencer are wonderful characters, whose time spent between the sheets often left me breathless. JC is a fantastic little boy, one I would have liked to scoop up and take home with me.

Drawing on her personal collection of writings, Graham offers a broad array of opinions and observations in more than 100 articles and essays from humorists, journalists, novelists, socialites, and political luminaries and their wives--many of them personal friends. The book is arranged by theme--social Washington, president watching, wartime Washington--with Graham setting the scene and tone beforehand, using insights gleaned from her mother's diary for the period pieces. Will Rogers offers insights on Calvin Coolidge, Barbara Howar recalls a falling out with the Lyndon Johnsons, Henry Kissinger recalls the end of the Nixon presidency, and Eugene Robinson offers a look at the black Washington tourists rarely see. It's all inside Washington, sharp, witty, and carefully chosen to convey the city's atmosphere and personality and Graham's own interests in the people and the politics--social and governmental. A worthy follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography,Personal History(1997).Vanessa BushCopyright © American Library Association.

Good stuff, this. From the hip, but straight-shooting all the way through.\"~Paul Pintarich, \"Pages\" Columnist, The Oregonian\"The Craft of Corporate Journalismcovers just the kind of subjects that effective business communicators need to master. Most importantly, it offers ways around the traps that so often turn corporate writing into the kind of plodding, predictable prose that marches straight into the trash. Listen to Lionel Fisher. He'll help you get your words into your readers' heads, not their round files.\"~Jack Hart, Managing Editor,The Oregonian\"Good corporate journalism does not reflect 'his master's voice' but links the goals of corporate communications to the high expectations of reading employees. It is a tough but rewarding job, and Fisher perfectly explains what corporate journalists need to achieve not only to reach but also move the reader. The author places the journalistic principles in the corporate context. I don't recall any other book that did this before. The book is not exactly encyclopedic, but rather highly motivating and very original. For example, the chapter on article leads is unforgettable.

Chloe, however, is very good at taking people for who they are. She provides Mr. Stink with shelter, food, and friendship, and in the process unburdens herself to him and learns his secrets. This British import is reminiscent of Roald Dahl's books in its silly, exaggerated storytelling, and while some words may be unfamiliar to American readers and the ending is a bit melodramatic, the characters are appealing, the situations are hilarious, and the plot moves quickly.

Though death in battle is a great honor-even for the four sisters he leaves behind, forced to plan his funeral after a seven-month absence-his wife, born Grace Forrest in Toronto, feels marooned among people who have never fully accepted her. That's when Frank, an American with a broken-down motorcycle, appears at her gates. Frank, unlike Grace, is quickly adopted by the town-Grace's father-in-law even mistakes him for his own son-and gives Grace a reason to hope for love and a normal life again. As both a grieving widow and a fish out of water, Grace is an affecting character with well-articulated values; unfortunately, Frank proves little more than a cipher, rendering a late-breaking plot twist inert.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Grubbs writes on this subject from years of experience. She has spent a large share of her life as an advocate for persons abused by people they love. Consequently, some of this book is disconcerting, but Grubbs breaks the mood with humor and romance. Her characters are believable because they are based on real-life people. And, the \"good guys,\" who are very likeable, eventually come out on top.  Grubbs is an excellent story-teller. I couldn't put the book down,and read it in one sitting. Her knowledge of life, and of people, comes alive through her writing. She is a \"gem,\" yet to be discovered.

Yes No Report abuse | Permalink Comment Comment --Amazon.com5.0 out of 5 stars Keep those pages turning, July 28, 2010  By 812591info - See all my reviewsThis review is from: The Monday Night Flight Club (Greyhound Lady Walking) (Kindle Edition)  At just eighteen, Presley finds her Prince Charming, Bristol, who whisks her off to England. Presley soon discovers, however, that her prince is really a beast, who repeatedly abuses her. Presley finally escapes, and she has grown from her hardship. She now helps other abused women escape their abusers, by establishing the \"Monday Night Flight Club.\" The ex-husband, however, is determined to have revenge, by taking Presley's new life apart. Although, Presley is ever facing a new challenge, she is not alone. She has the help of the foster family that raised her, in addition to her makeshift family of the people she has brought into her home. Will the obsessive hate of one man prevail? Or, can a group of people, brought together by adversity, use their love to conquer all?  Joyce Godwin Grubbs will keep you turning the pages. Her pose is smooth and flowing, creating a book that reads so quickly you won't want to put it down. We are often on the edge of our seat as Presley faces seemingly endless challenges. Then, with the help of her extended family, she finds a unique and fascinating escape. Each of these vignettes gives the reader an uplifting feeling that is full of hope. All the while, we learn about how abused women are freed from their circumstances. No longer victims, abused women and abandoned children have grown together to help one another, as well as others in need.  The novel is fleshed out with several fascinating and admirable characters. Momma Bets steals all her scenes, thanks to her strong personality and wisdom. Chase captures our hearts with his unshakable love of Presley.  This novel successfully works on two completely different levels. On one level, it is a community service, alerting the reader to domestic violence and what can be done to help. On another level, it is a compelling suspense, as the cunning villain is known, but repeatedly escapes being caught. With both aspects combined, this book becomes a powerful read.

During the year preceding Gettysburg, the costliest fighting ever known to man is seen on the fields of Manassas and Antietam. Hand-to-hand combat was the rule. Both sides determined to end the war quickly yet too hastily entered into battle. In Winchester, Virginia, several twenty-year-old school friends make a decision of a lifetime and the consequences are devastating. In Washington, President Lincoln, his Cabinet and Union generals are at wits end attempting to trap the elusive Stonewall Jackson. This gripping saga comes to an epic conclusion when all the betrayals are exposed and the mysterious agents revealed.

I live in rural west Alabama in an old farming community just north of Gordo where I was raised, and have been blessed to see a little more of nature and the hand of God in creation than most. I have tried to expose my wife and two sons to this as much as possible. It has been a joy watchin them grow in the Lord. God has been very real to me since I was a child and has been more than just an idea or a distant entity. It has been refreshing in seeing that God has also revealed Himself to my sons in this manner as my oldest accepted the call to preach himself at the tender age of 15, and my youngest has found a love for using his talents as a singer and musician at 14. It is this relationship with a God that reveals Himself to children and adults alike that has drawn me to find His character and His word so fascinating. It is my desire that all who name the name of Christ be strngthened and encouraged through the study of scripture so that we can all stand together in this growing darkness that seems to be enveloping the Earth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her companion is a former friend of her mother's, a woman whose odious personality would have pushed a less forbearing person to murder. Miss Oakswine has made her charge miserable for three years since the death of Daphne's parents, yet Daphne cannot bring herself to discharge her. An elephant at Astley's Royal Amphitheater solves the problem by startling the woman into heart failure.  Just prior to the incident with the elephant, Daphne have been assisted in the rescue of an abused cat by Lord Ravenswood, newly returned home from Egypt where he had recouped the family fortunes through the antiquities trade. His servant Eugene, who feels a personal obligation to Ravenswood, and plans to see him wed before he returns to his homeland, accompanies him. Eugene has found the perfect candidate in the form of Miss Daphne Kendall. He is ably abetted by Miss Oakswine's replacement, Miss Shelby, hired by Daphne off a park bench. Miss Selby has some unusual beliefs about past lives and the Spirit World, which she is not afraid to voice. She and Eugene discover they are soulmates, but before they can find their own happiness, they must unite their employers, a task not easily accomplished.  Rosemary Stevens has brought together an odd cast of mystics, nobles and villains that mesh to produce a finely woven tapestry of a story. Her use of Mihos the cat and a trio of lovable canines to propel the plot is a delight.Lord and Master will tickle your funny bone as well as your fancy!

The International Commission for Radiological Protection maintains that all radiation exposure, even in small amounts, is harmful and has a cumulative effect that raises our risk of cancer, but not all radiation scientists agree. Voosen seeks out both sides of the debate and translates the science of radiation and our exposure to it into simple terms, making the ineffable a tangible pleasure for non-scientific readers. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When unknown assailants attack Lassair's cousin Morcar while he's fishing for eels one night, they leave him close to death. With Lassair's teacher otherwise engaged, she must try to save Morcar's life. After she succeeds in stabilizing her patient, 16-year-old Lassair turns her attention to identifying the men responsible for the assault and their motives. She soon learns that the culprits, who may be connected with a local monastery, are still looking to tie up loose ends by eliminating Morcar—and that they're prepared to kill her as well.

Collie leans in that direction, but, fortunately he doesn’t overbeat the drum of moral outrage. Instead, he has provided a well-researched account of the mission, the men who carried it out, and the experience of the victims. He effectively uses interviews, letters, and diaries that humanize the participants and stir emotions. There is plenty of technical information here, but it doesn’t detract from the sense of doom and tragedy. Nagasaki was the secondary target, selected when cloud-cover obscured the primary target, Kokura. Although the Hiroshima mission was executed flawlessly, the Nagasaki mission was repeatedly plagued by mishaps that almost led to dumping the bomb in the Pacific. Given what is now known, that could have been a blessing for all concerned. For general readers unfamiliar with the often neglected second nuclear attack, Collie offers an informative and moving chronicle. --Jay Freeman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Following a professional basketball playing career in Australia – the 6’6” (198cm) Bruce is probably the last person walking down the street you’d expect to be the writer of these beautiful and moving words. “It’s a gift I uncovered during that moving time in my life, and now I’ve just run with it. Once I get the idea for a verse for an Angel – it may take a moment or a month to come out through my pen. But when it is ready to come out – I start writing – and many of these verses come out without errors – just as you see them on the cards.” says Bruce. With a happy and sincere demeanor, a constant smile and an infectious enthusiasm for life and all things it brings – Bruce can be seen sharing this enthusiasm and positiveness throughout his daily writings of his “Life Tips” (see and become a fan (like) on Facebook www.facebook.com/pocketangels) and coaching kids in basketball, life and sport. An accomplished speaker with a positive message, much experience in business and in life – with a history and discipline of sport, business and travel around the world – his talks can focus on many different areas. Yet – if you ask Bruce what his greatest life achievement is to date – he will instantly praise his beautiful wife Belinda and his boys Conner and Jamieson. (Yes – they’re going to be very tall as well!)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What happens when runners tackle a marathon over slush, ice and naked rock on an Antarctic island? Yes, their race times are much slower, but this bizarre exercise has, over the past 10 years, raised concerns far beyond the typical marathoners'. Author and Runner's World contributing editor Hanc (The Essential Marathoner) devotes the sea lion's share of this ice-bound marathon memoir to these concerns, especially in examining the determined, colorful runners competing alongside him (including \"bicycle-riding grandmas\" and a wheelchair-bound marathoner from Singapore). The 50-year-old writer became interested after speaking with a recently returned friend (\"'It feels like I just got back from another planet,' Lipsky said\") and soon found himself considering the race in spite of his better sense-improbably, the devoted runner had pushed himself to the point where running 26.2 miles on the streets of New York, Chicago or London was just too cushy. The Antarctic, of course, provides all the challenge he could ever want, and his sharp, fun and funny account captures well the incredible ferocity of life there. Though a special treat for runners, travel readers and non-athletes interested in extreme human experiences will also find this a bracing read.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chun demonstrates convincingly that programmability is an 'ideological belief,' and in so doing challenges received ideas about digital media's supposedly objective relation to truth, noncontingency, and operability. This book is of tremendous importance to gender studies, digital media studies, history, and science and technology studies.\"Lisa Nakamura, Asian American Studies Program and Institute of Communications Research, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\"In a move of stunning originality, Wendy Chun argues that belief in 'programmability' fuels the current organization of the modern liberal state. Computer code, she tells us, is fetish -- a magical entity thanks to which individuals believe themselves agents of causality and sovereignty. In truth, though, power lies elsewhere -- most importantly in the social, political, and economic relations embedded within and materialized in the software and hardware that render us desiring subjects. Essential for students of science and media studies.\"Timothy W. Lenoir, Kimberly Jenkins Chair for New Technologies and Society, Duke University\"Once again, Wendy Chun proves herself to be the indispensable critic of Internet and computer cultures. We learn how the computer thinks us and the implications of that thought in terms of race, gender, and visuality. Chun creates a new and flexible terminology that displaces our sense of the computer as a transparent WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) servant into a twinned relationship of causality and ignorance. From here, neither the computer nor visual culture will look the same again.\"Nicholas Mirzoeff, Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, New York University", "related": [], "rank": 1290729, "title": "Programmed Visions: Software and Memory (Software Studies)", "author": "Wendy Hui Kyong Chun", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Teenager Caitlin and her step-father--a widower, insurance-claims processor, and the first-person narrator of Bradford Morrow'sFall of the Birds--are flummoxed.

(\"Caitlin and I were like stray moons who'd lost their host planet and were flying blind, wobbling as we went.\") As the birds continue to die inexplicably, Morrow's tale portrays sorrowful depths, filial love, and human resilience with a language that maintains an impressively delicate balance: impassioned yet elegant, gravid yet light, studied but never unapproachable. Ultimately, and to its credit, the story adheres to a human/animal metaphor as bluntly constructed as Sherwood Anderson's \"The Egg,\" for as Morrow's narrator says: \"Canaries were taken into coal mines for good reason.

Using Leon as a guide I learned the truth\nabout my heritage. It was part of a rich tapestry for 800-900 years in\nPoland / Galicia but suddenly turned into a nightmare within only a few\nyears. Somehow this story got under my skin and made me a passionate, if\n not outspoken voice for those who were downtrodden, and worse.    What did you\nlearn? So many things. I learned how to write a book. I now realize it isn't an impossible task. I learned about\nPoland and the the Jews of Galicia. Their lives were full of joy and hard work. They lived a slow life where\nthe animals set the pace. Yet sparks of energy flew by, cars and fast\ntrains. All things that inspire.What is the most significant\ntake away from reading this book? \"Freedom. We have nothing without our\nfreedom. It must be protected at all costs.\" - Leon SchagrinWhat were some of the\n unforeseen consequences of writing this book? I met a world of people\nwhom I would have never met.

In his amazing book \"Endangered Eagle\" readers are transported back in time to Germany prior to WWII. The 1936 Olympics was taking place in Berlin. Jesse Owens made the United States proud by winning 4 gold medals in track and field.General Hermann Wilhelm Goering invites Colonel Charles Lindbergh, the honored hero who flew solo from New York to Paris, to visit the Olympics. Shortly before Lindbergh arrived in Berlin, a plot to murder him by a crime ring was discovered. General Goering engaged Karl von Ernst to investigate and hence begins this great mystery. Von Ernst is both our main character and our narrator. Even with his massive credentials he faces danger at every turn.While Roth has provided readers with an excellent mystery, one of the things that stood out to me was how he captures the ambiance of the era. If history was taught in school in the same exciting and interesting manner as this book succeeds in doing, our students would be listening and learning more. It is obvious that Roth spent much time researching for this book. He brings history to life. Roth has a talent for taking his research and molding it into a plot that is sure to captivate the attention of readers. This book is well-organized and keeps the readers’ attention to the very last page. He has even included twists, turns and a surprising ending. I suspect Mr. Roth has a best seller on his hands and it would not surprise me if a movie deal is in his future.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The episode is the latest in a series of odd, neglectful, and infuriating incidents exhibited by his wife after the family moves from Arizona back to their home state of Michigan following Rhodes’s service in the air force.Rhodes clearly has a story to tell—a couple, in fact. He recognizes that something is wrong in his marriage, but this knowledge is coupled with disbelief, denial, and uncertainty about what he can or should do. The ensuing custody battle prepares him for the next storm he must face: getting caught up in departmental politics and becoming a fall guy.Narrated in stream-of-consciousness style, with loose adherence to punctuation and grammar, Rhodes’s words are nonetheless very powerful and engaging. Readers will shake their heads in disbelief as Rhodes writes of his encounters with various court personnel and the prejudices he faces on his journey as a single father trying to raise his daughters on his own.Interspersed between Rhodes’s personal conflicts are the police calls. Each of these is a story in itself, covering all range of human emotions. Rhodes shows his sense of humor is still intact despite the tussles he has been through. For example, he admits that stressful situations often times bring up weird coping mechanisms, such as when he deals with a shooting victim: “Carefully, I opened his shirt, just tearing the buttons off and un-tucking it from his pants. Being that it was the new millennium, I knew that if the phone on the counter rang, it would be the nineteen seventies calling, asking this guy to please return these polyester clothes, his butterfly collared shirt and high waist disco pants.” It turns out the victim was shot, but not wounded in any way. Rhodes chalks the incident up to being a miracle, one of several he witnessed in his police tour.Black and Blue is based on true events, and the author gives a warning, acknowledging the content includes extreme language, violence, and adult sexuality. While this is true about the language, there is not a gratuitous amount of violence or sex. In keeping with the free-form style, chapters are not numbered, but their titles are illustrated by the author. Small, pencil-drawn pictures of content-appropriate icons—such as a telephone, an eye, an inhaler—appear next to the text.Readers who like true-to-life experiences and who want to know about how others overcome adversity will enjoy this book. Because of the writing style, it might be difficult for some to follow. Those who stick with it will find a rewarding message. –Robin Farrell Edmunds, Forward Clarion Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While longer books are great, there are times when you need a more\n compact, tightly-written story that will fit into your schedule. The\n\"Angel Without A Soul\" series was created to meet that need.This\n series is primarily action/thriller/mystery stories. Touching on\n\"Noir\", there is also an element of the paranormal. It is up to the\nreader to decide what is actually going on. This will be developed\nslowly as the series progresses, revealing more, and demanding more of\nthe reader, as it goes. Each book is a stand-alone work, but references\nto events or situations in earlier books may appear now and then, when a\n little background info is helpful.My goal is to produce 3 to 6\n books in the series per year for as long as interest, both yours and\nmine, survives.

Among the more well known titles he has written for are The Guardian newspaper, Time Out magazine and the International Business Times website.  He has edited a number of local and community newspapers, magazines and websites, and has, over the course of his career, worked for some of the largest publishers in Europe, including Emap, LLP and Mirror Group Newspapers.  Abdul has also worked outside of the United Kingdom, moving to Abu Dhabi for a year to work on the first national daily newspaper in United Arab Emirates, The National; and he has consulted for media companies in Bangladesh, where he was born.  Abdul briefly worked for a New York-headquartered cable television channel called AsiaNet as a news editor, and realised that although he loves researching, writing and other \"technical\" parts of a journalist's job, he does not like presenting, preferring to be behind the camera or back in the studio.  He also realised that, although reporting a story through the medium of television is obviously different from telling it through a newspaper or magazine, the heart and mind of every media company is researching and writing.  In his spare time, Abdul likes to spend time with his family, cooking, eating, watching films, listening to music, reading and writing. When he goes out he likes to watch movies at the best cinemas, see live music performances, and eat at good restaurants. He also loves gardening, fishing and going for long walks.", "related": ["B00FTUFPHO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Manassis teaches clinicians how and when to use this strategy in a clear, detailed, step-by-step approach. The book is rich with case examples and clinical wisdom. It equips clinicians with the foundation they need to teach children and parents how to successfully use problem solving and incorporate it into their daily lives.\"--Golda S.

This is a highly useful guide for therapists and counselors working with children and adolescents.\"--Jill Waterman, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles\"Practical, readable, compassionate, and filled with rich and realistic examples from the author’s extensive clinical experience, this book provides detailed guidance for effective problem solving with young people and families with a variety of challenges. A particular strength is the author’s wise attention to  common pitfalls  in applying these strategies.

They do involve some things that are definitely not vanilla, including spanking, caning, fisting, anal and public sex yet these scenes fit perfectly within the tale and never seemed to be extraneous or unsuitable to the developing relationship between these hot-blooded characters.

Subject to that, this provides a refreshing new introduction to the subject matter. It is certainly worth considering for your next year’s intake of students.\"—David J. Hand,International Statistical Review(2013), 81, 2\"Recent trends in probability and statistics reference works and textbooks include placing a greater emphasis on authentic problems and data. To this end, Schoenberg (UCLA) avoids the traditional \"balls in an urn\" approach to probability, and interestingly ties basic probability theory to Texas holdem poker. The content is challenging but thorough, and the reader needs to think through the poker realities as well as the related probability theory. Introductory chapters stress basic principles of counting, permutations, combinations, and conditional probabilities, but inevitably tie back to Texas hold’em hands. Many of the examples are based on actual tournament results, making the resulting discussions even more authentic. Given the discrete nature of poker hands, it was interesting to see the author tackle continuous data by investigating wait times between eliminations, again maintaining the Texas hold’em theme. More advanced topics show bluffing tied to the Poisson distribution and late player arrival to exponential random variables. Ultimately, the book provides heavily theoretic coverage and calculus-based support of various distributions, but the link to poker is never abandoned. Includes a helpful glossary of Texas hold’em terminology. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates, faculty, and informed general readers.\"—CHOICE MagazineJUNE 2012\"it is the laserlike focus of the examples and exercises that sets this book apart from other probability textbooks at this level. … The book is incredibly well-researched — examples are drawn from actual televised poker games, and many explorations of the probabilities in play in a given game situation conclude with a sentence about what really happened, which is a nice touch.\"—Mark Bollman,MAA Reviews, February 2012", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Devastated by guilt because he had not understood a prophetic dream, he leaves the ruined farm. As he wanders toward a nearby village, he continues dreaming?and the dreams keep coming true, albeit in an oblique and frightening fashion. After a narrow escape from a would-be kidnapper, the boy falls in with a traveling magician and his companion. The man nicknames him Hobby, after a small hawk species. Together, the three journey to Carmarthen, where the lad ends up relating one of his dreams to an audience at the palace. The magician interprets the dreams to a positive end, but the boy knows he has prophesied the duke's death. Later, abandoned by his companions, Hobby gets the chance to tell the truth, but the duke refuses to heed him, and Hobby continues alone upon his life's path. Though little information about Merlin's childhood appears in legend, this tale weaves in names and details that appear in adult versions of the wizard's story: Ambrosius (the magician); Vortigern (the unnamed duke); the vision of fighting dragons. The characters are well drawn and appealing. However, the action moves along so quickly that readers barely get to know them. At 104 pages, this title is maddeningly short.

She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world. She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B. Dalton bestsellers list, a feat never achieved before or since by any author. Barbara Cartland became a legend in her own lifetime and will be best remembered for her wonderful romantic novels so loved by her millions of readers throughout the world, who have always collected her books to read again and again, especially when they feel miserable or depressed.Her books will always be treasured for their moral message, her pure and innocent heroines, her handsome and dashing heroes, her blissful happy endings and above all for her belief that the power of love is more important than anything else in everyone’s life.", "related": ["B008B8AQ98"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This devastating file is provided by an unlikely source. Bin Laden begins preparations for the financial attack which is intercepted by the American intelligence. The CIA works with Saudi intelligence to track him down and prevent the upcoming financial Armageddon. However, contents of the document become known to American government. Fearing the consequences of such a revelation--which in addition to devastating all Western economies financially, is more than likely to revive Al Qaeda by bringing in much needed funds--the US Department of State secretly scraps the original mission to bring the world's most wanted terrorist alive to America for a trial, and replaces it with a kill mission.The book reveals rare details on both Al Qaeda and the CIA.       LIVING WITH THE BIN LADENS is a story to be read slowly, absorbing the details of life at the hands of the world's most wanted terrorist.  It is riveting, full of drama, and educational--a story that will live long in the minds of the readers.     - Judi Blaze, a Journalist and Award Winning Novelist", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That might not be a bad thing, however, as the mystery of who killed young country superstar Buford Doakes is less interesting than Liz's relationship with her NYPD boyfriend, Ike. Liz has left her Staten Island home for a weekend getaway to a resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains--the same one where Doakes is headlining. Accompanying her is best-friend Sophie, a new member of the NYPD who's engaged to fellow-cop Ralph. Not big fans of Doakes, Sophie and Liz are somewhat surprised to be invited to a preconcert party in his suite. Curiosity wins out and they attend, only to leave when Doakes' sleazy manager herds all the girls into the hot tub for a photo shoot. After Doakes is found murdered the next morning, the girls begin to investigate and are soon joined by Ralph and Ike. A pleasant outing for fans of lite mystery.Jenny McLarinCopyright © American Library Association.

Yuzuk was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and he always enjoyed being involved in athletics. He played high school and college football and has studied the martial arts. Leaving Brooklyn, he moved to South Florida where he has been working as a Police Officer for the last fourteen years. On his days off, he works on his various creative projects—writing, acting, and filmmaking. As part-time actor David Danello, he has had speaking roles on TV shows like Burn Notice, The Glades, and America's Most Wanted. His movie roles include Miami Vice, U.S.S. Seaviper, House of Bodies, I Love Miami, Assumed Memories, and 5th of a Degree. He was nominated for Best Actor by the Miami Life Awards for his leading role as David Ross in 5th of a Degree. David's passion for writing started with screenplays and he has IMDB credit as a co-producer and co-author of the film 5th of a Degree (as David Danello). 5th of a Degree is the winner of the 2012 Golden Ace Award at the Las Vegas Film Festival. David has also written an illustrated children's book The Legend of the Smiling Chihuahua (www.smilinglegend.com). ------------------ Neil L. Yuzuk was born in Brooklyn, New York. He worked in sales and sales management before returning to college as a freshman at age 40. In 1987, he began working as a New York City Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Counselor, working in the high school SPARK Program. After he retired, his full-time police officer/actor son David said, “Hey Pops, why don’t you write a screenplay for me.” He wrote a police procedural called, The Devil’s Troll. “The experience of learning how to do research and creating characters and their back stories was an incredible learning experience.” He then teamed up with David to collaborate on their first screenplay The Reluctant Knight. That screenplay eventually became the first book in the Beachside PD series—Beachside PD: The Reluctant Knight—and it was a Global eBook Awards finalist in the category of Suspense/Thriller. Since then, he’s co-authored the recently published Beachside PD: The Gypsy Hunter and he is currently working on the fourth book in the series, Beachside PD: Undercover (scheduled for December, 2012). A family saga novel called Zaragossa: Fruit Of The Vine is scheduled for December, 2014.", "related": ["B006QZWZQU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Let alone explaining how complex but complementary sex organs could possible evolve in separate male and female forms of any organism. Written in simple language, but approved for technical accuracy by a top Porton Down scientist, this book is required reading for any Christian person wishing to understand the arguments and errors of evolution and how misguided  \"young-earth\" creationists helps keep Darwinism alive.

On the road to publication, PJ decided that indie-publishing was the best fit for her books. They fall outside the norm for YA fiction in that they are geared toward 16-22 year old readers, a market considered risky with traditional publishers. Hers, however, aren’t your average high school stories. Instead, they are portraits of the real life issues of older teens and their struggles with family, friends, and the guys they fall for. Although the themes are mature, evoking plenty of drama and teen angst, PJ writes with a positive outlook and promises a hopefully ever after end to all of her books. Because of this, readers of all ages will be captivated by the emotional and romantic journeys of her characters.  After a tumultuous youth and a challenging young adulthood that gave her plenty of personal experiences from which to draw, PJ has found her bliss in sharing her wisdom and stories with teens and adults alike. When she isn’t writing and publishing, she is owner of ABSolute Fitness and Therapeutic Body Works, a private practice Massage Therapy and Personal Training business that she founded in 2005.  Writing romantic fiction for the past seven years, and following her destiny to write Extraordinary stories of an average teen-age life, PJ lives with her husband in the Berkshire Hills of Western MA.

When another member of the guild of hangmen dies in a similarly brutal fashion, a conspiracy is suspected. After Roger miraculously survives a bout of the usually fatal sweating sickness, he and his beloved master, Benjamin Daunbey, are commissioned by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey to investigate a blackmail scheme recently launched against King Henry VIII. When Roger and Benjamin link the extortion attempt to the murder of the gallowsmen, they must reach back into the past and solve a 40-year-old mystery in order to expose both a motive and a murderer.

Ultimately, he helped teach, then taught, the Wine Course at Cornell. After graduation, John opened John Byron's Restaurant, which became famous for its fine cuisine and Wine Spectator awards for its creative, extensive wine list. All the while, he kept stoking his ever-consuming wine discovery fire, joining the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, then writing a wine column for Milwaukee Magazine.

Your teaching will be anointed! -John Ford Highland Terrace Baptist Church Greenville, Texas Believer Class Age 60-graduationGod has utilized the Lesson's from Good Questions to minister to us. The questions are really good for facilitating meaningful conversation. Our class grew from 10 people to more than 40 in one year!!! We don't have a room big enough for us now. The format saves us time in preparation in order that we might be able to work on the ministry needs of our class.Jim Cox Lubbock, TX Indiana Ave. Baptist ChurchI love using your lessons. I use them almost every Sunday. They really do get the conversation going. I usually learn more from my class input in 45 minutes than I do studying the background info, for hours, on each lesson. These lessons nearly always provide insight I would never have seen. Thank you for taking the time to write these lesson questions. I believe my presentation would be a lot less interesting without your help.Your friend,Brian Newell Life Community Church Jamestown NC class age 35-75", "related": ["B00B00Z3J2"], "rank": 2388534, "title": "Good Questions Have Small Groups Talking -- Amos and Jonah", "author": "Josh Hunt", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lucas Ridgely, a rich young American, saves Meghan from being raped on board.  Meghan feels guilty over the blossoming attraction between herself and Lucas.  Little does she know that Rafferty, whom she sees as trustworthy, generous and staid, bullies female customers into bartering sexual favors for goods in the store he manages!  Lucas abhors marriage, raised by warring parents.  He spent much of his youth with his dear Aunt Flora, a textile magnate.  Lucas asks Meghan to be his mistress, but she declines on moral grounds.  The two waver between magnetism and misgivings as he sees her safely to her destination.  By now, the reader knows that Rafferty has become the kept man of Alicia, his boss' wife.  The lovers agree that his marriage will be the perfect cover-up for their ongoing affair.  Rafferty sends Meghan a few towns away to work and save her wages for their future while he postpones the wedding to allow her a period of mourning for her late father!   Meghan wants to sort out her feelings, so she agrees to the time apart.  When Meghan discovers the women working the looms with her are being mistreated by an overseer, she leads a work stoppage.  The factory owner's nephew arrives to quell the uprising -- yes, Lucas Ridgely.  To stop her upstart activity, but see to it that Meghan is provided for, it's arranged that she will become Flora's personal seamstress.  Meghan decides to break the engagement.  She goes to find Raff, only to find him making love with yet another  woman!  He doesn't even go after Meg to try to explain.  Then Alicia decides to renew her marriage, dumping Raff.  He had expected to have two women; he goes crazy now that he has neither, stalking Meghan.  Lucas' claiming her as his own is not destined to be easy, but he is once more, and forever more, her rescuer.

The number and frankness of such scenes may be past the comfort level of some readers.If spicy and steamy is your style, Irish Linen  will bring you delight! Another skillfully told tale of love from McCarthy -- once more, enjoy the talent that's made her so successful. A tribute to our immigrant ancestors' courage!  Come with Meghan McBride on her voyage to America.  Conquer with her the challenges her new life brings.  Share the adventure, the anguish, the treasure of growing love.

It lacked, thankfully, the pedantic, overly-academic tone that can be an obstacle to many students. I appreciate the fact that Dr. Wright writes in a way that is easily understood by the non-music major. . . . The three greatest strengths of the text are (1) the easy manner and conversational style with which the material is treated, (2) the more global approach to the music of the 20th century, and (3) the connections to pop music that Dr. Wright makes to illustrate both musical characteristics and context.\"\"Strengths: 1.The numerous additional listening selections AND listening guides online. Excellent for those serious students who would go the extra mile. 2.Even though I currently do not have use for it, I am sure instructors in general appreciates the online grading for the listening exercises. 3. Reference to current developments and personalities.\"\"The organization of LISTENING TO MUSIC is excellent and it is a good survey of Western Art Music.\"\"The first chapter is far superior [to the text in use]. I feel that students need an explanation of the current state of popular music with comparisons to the past. . . . Today's students are engrossed in pop music and do not have even a basic understanding of why things are. Because students are entrenched in pop music, many of them are not interested into delving into topics that challenge the ideologies they are accustomed too.

While\nthe memory of his brother and the circumstances of his death haunt him,\nJeremiah enters a pathway to find true love that actually deceives his ability\nfor growth. The path of not seizing each and every day and the excuses he uses\nto reason his way through life takes a toll on him. He wastes years in waiting\nfor something to happen. Jeremiah's inability to exhibit wisdom equal to his\nage and experience, over time, catches up with him, and he is left with what he\nmay do to be rescued and what he may do to escape. Rocket- a macaw with a rich\nhistory touches the lives of his owners and charms his way into their hearts.\nHaving a knack for brushes with celebrity and becoming somewhat famous himself,\nhe quietly lives his life, rocking and squawking, in his own anonymity. With a\nlifespan of over ninety years, Rocket provides luck for his owners as they go\nabout their lives, thinking they are taking care of him. Without Its Finish, Before I Slept- a young man's love letter\nwritten over three decades ago examines a year or more of wasted youth and its\ngrasps for maturity over immaturity. Each failure he experiences brings him\ncloser to another attempt at choosing to fight irresponsibility by facing\nresponsibility itself.

I loved my English and Literature courses, and I had more than one Professor encourage me to write. But lacking the courage to submit my stories they grew dust, both in the physical form and digitally. At the age of forty-nine I sold everything bought a travel trailer and moved to Moab, Utah where I spend my time Camp Hosting for the BLM, and various other jobs, allowing me to write nearly full time. But on a whim I submitted one of my stories “The Fourth Age”, and it was accepted, to my great surprise.  Encouraged, I quickly dusted off my other short stories and outlines, and “Dead Awake” followed by “The Fourth Age II: In Search of Esther” was published.  During my latest winter layoff I wrote the three stories I’ve decided to publish digitally; “The Reunion Part I: Revelations”, and Part II: Fire and Ice”, \"After the Fall\", and “When Worlds Collide”.  I am now working on the third “Reunion” sequel as well as “The Reaping” and “Fourteen Days Later”.", "related": [], "rank": 2748760, "title": "After the Fall", "author": "Mark Brown", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Voulant vérifier l'adage selon lequel « le droit mène à tout, à condition d'en sortir », mes efforts d'évasion furent récompensés en 2008 par une reconversion dans le multimédia, principalement en production de jeux vidéos et d'applications mobiles.  J'ai eu le plaisir de participer à la création d'une dizaine de titres depuis et de baigner dans un milieu créatif et déjanté, troquant le costume pour le jeans ! J'ai baigné, depuis mon enfance, dans un mélange de cultures, d'influences et d'expériences qui m'ont permis de satisfaire un trait fondamental de mon caractère: la curiosité ! L'humour et le refus de se prendre au sérieux font également partie intégrante de ma personnalité: le plaisir de faire des bons mots, spirituels, ou pas, je l'ai hérité de ma grand-mère. C'est finalement toute cette expérience de vie, aussi bien professionnelle que personnelle, qui m'a finalement amené à me lancer dans l'écriture de roman... Sauf que... L'envie était là, pas le déclic. Jusqu'à ce fameux matin ou les personnages que j'avais en tête depuis un petit moment se mirent à prendre vie: la série des aventures de Rossetti & MacLane était née ! Placée sous le signe des nouvelles technologies (naturellement), de l'humour (évidemment) et du suspense (forcément), on assiste à la naissance d'une complicité entre deux êtres qui auraient très bien pu ne jamais se rencontrer et vont pourtant former un duo très efficace !

The Hemingway-like style of staying out of the way and having characters reveal themselves through dialogue works to perfection here. The realization that our narrator is the sexiest and most humane character in the novel comes from seeing how others interact with him. Among the supporting cast, Case and his son Taylor are especially beautifully-drawn. Once again Hartwell uses sex as the vehicle for character study, and once again the result is a wonderful read. Many readers will find it both sensuous and oddly charming.\"Hartwell's books have all been experimental in nature, and this work is the most experimental of them all, with the possible exception of Atom Heart John Beloved. Taking a Walt Whitman poem's metaphor for a phallus as his title, Hartwell explores the power of masculine sexuality in the interactions of a number of intriguing characters. Strangely, the most engaging character in the novel other than the protagonist is the only character portrayed as straight, the handsome boy Taylor who grows up to be a national sports superstar. The fact that the narrator is in love with Taylor for most of Taylor's life and Taylor doesn't mind, and the fact that Hartwell doesn't explore, explain, or even mention their relationship until late in the novel, gives the book a power that surprised me.\" - Marcus Parr, Go Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Harding, an Australian, lives in Florida with his American wife Lynne. The experienced worldwide traveler has lived and worked in five countries; his native Australia - New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain (London), to his current home, the USA.  His childhood years were spent in a home for unwanted children, where he was raised under strict supervision, before being sent alone into an unknown world at the age of sixteen. Considered free and able to get on with his life, soon, with work money saved, the wanderlust to travel emerged. The world, over the next few years, would become his larger educational playground. Spending 4 years in England, touring and working a variety of jobs, a stand-out experience was in the shadows of the famous white Cliffs of Dover; a car-park-jockey to the English Channel Cross Continental Sea-Port Ferries. More travel and music beckoned! In Canada, from being (again), a car-park-jockey in Toronto, he pursued a career in music/radio (his first love) becoming an on-air Radio Disc Jockey in Thunder Bay, Ontario, rising through to General Manager (Northwestern Ontario Broadcasting) Dryden. After 5 years, his craft ‘honed’ it was time to travel again, predictably back to his homeland. Now married with two children, he returned to Australia to a position of Program Director (Radio 4BK Brisbane). Four years later he switched musical chairs to join the record industry, RCA Ltd (Australia) as National Sales Manager Sydney, before being appointed to Auckland, New Zealand as General Manager RCA. Returning to Australia, he continued to extend his media credentials via the Newspaper print media conglomerate (Queensland Newspapers) as General Manager, The Daily Telegraph. Three years later he went back to his roots, re-entering radio; General Manager Radio (4BK) Brisbane - his old stomping ground where he spent the ten years.  Expectedly, the mystery of travel again beckoned Tour Guide out of Australia. Traveling extensively by bus, through Europe - the job was a natural! A partnership, combining Sports Management, (football, cricket, swimming and surf-lifesaving) followed, including a host of exciting global activities, many on the west coast of the USA. In 1995 he remarried. California became his new home. A decade later, he and Lynne moved to Florida. Close to his children Justin and Lisa and their growing family, they reside in Brisbane, Australia.

During the journey,  I attended modeling with NY Modeling company, did theatrical work with Jester Productions (now Dream Alley Studios), and performed in various local musicals and pageants along the way. Needless to say, I was very busy, very young.  Along the way,  I developed a passion for writing, but this did not come until my 8th grade school year. Prior to that I will say I hated reading and writing with a passion. It wasn’t until I picked up that one special book, enriched with fantasy, that something clicked. After that,  it was hard to take a book away from me, and as I became inspired by friends and family, I began to create my own world, and my own characters.  Sadly I lost my father in 2002. We often stayed up late watching the stars and talking about all the possibilities the universe held. He had a big hand in the world I created.  Currently, I have two wonderful children and a great husband who supports my dreams of writing.  I still live in Indiana and am working on the rest of the Alecien Series as well as a possible Aeralain Series.", "related": [], "rank": 4797148, "title": "Darkness of Order (The Alecien Series Book 2) eBook", "author": "Lyndie Swedersky", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There was a lot that I had not seen.  God did not punish Eve continually.  He forgave her and gave her a great place in this world. How could I have missed the pictures of God's love for women all of these years?If you want to be reassured of God's love for you as a woman, please read this book.  God loves women and wants us to know that He does. He has shown His love over and over. It is all right there in His Word for us to see.  We only have to look for it one precept at a time. I have laid out examples from His Word of this love.  Your spirits will be lifted as you see how a loving Father God shows you how He has loved women through the ages, and how He loves you too!ThanksMarylou Good", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is me, writing about me. No reason to pretend otherwise.  I got caught in the hamster wheel of modern, conventional life for a few years, doing things I thought I was \"supposed\" to be doing. I found a nice guy, got married, bought a little condo and started a cushy 9-5 office job.  That lasted a few years until BAM! I had a very powerful dream that prompted me to google \"birth\" and everything related to it. I knew nothing about birth and had absolutely no interest in the topic, to the extreme of not even wanting children. The whole thing seemed like a horrid, bloody pain fest that I wanted nothing to do with (thanks T.V, movies and media in general!) Shortly after the dream, I dove into birth work professionally working as a doula, childbirth educator and placenta crafter. I put in notice at my corporate job and all elements of my mainstream life continued to crumble. If I was this duped about birth - what else didn't I know? As it turns out - most things. I started searching for \"the truth\", which I'm sure will go on forever, but so far I've discovered a more holistic way of living in general, I stopped using chemicals in my home, I started eating locally and organically and I looked at my body as a whole being - mental, physical, spiritual, emotional - for the first time. All of that led to me getting divorced, traveling Europe solo for the summer, and then returning to fall in love with my best friend of many years.  Eventually I became so inspired by traveling and started yearning for a more mobile lifestyle in general. My birth work morphed from attending births and teaching locally to writing e-books, blogging, and creating a traveling placenta art show.  When I'm not knee deep in placentas, I enjoy throwing the frisbee, cooking, writing, hosting couch surfing or airbnb guests, talking about foreskin restoration, cuddling and doing naked yoga. I travel whenever I get the chance, with a particular love for European adventures. I am a native of Phoenix, AZ, aside from living in New York City for the year in 2005, and several months-long stints of travel.", "related": [], "rank": 700542, "title": "DIY Placenta Encapsulation: A Step-By-Step Guide", "author": "Katie DiBenedetto", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
