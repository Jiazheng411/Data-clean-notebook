Now in an attempt to get him to finally drop the fashionable, foppish charade he has presented to society for years and become the hero she knows he truly is, Diana allows herself to be abducted by the notorious Viscount Cordell. Both personal and professional reasons send Temple in pursuit of Diana, who has also become the target of several penniless noblemen with hopes of catching the spinster heiress themselves. With orders to steal the bride to-be and see that she is wed for her own safety to any suitable man, Temple never expected he would wind up wanting to marry the exasperating yet all too tempting Diana himself! Humor and passion were never more expertly entwined. Boyle cleverly matches up a tart-tongued, brilliantly resourceful heroine with an honorable, sinfully seductive hero, and then deftly sifts a dash of dangerous intrigue, wonderfully unique secondary characters, and a generous measure of wicked wit into this sweetly romantic, deliciously sensual love story.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

The ones she'd discovered when she'd shouldered her way into the study to deliver his afternoon cup of green tea and plate of Oreos. Evie's list had specified fig bars—in capital letters, no less—but over the course of the week Meghan had fed those to an adorable family of gray squirrels. That the discovery the squirrels liked fig bars had taken placeaftershe'd dumped the cookies out the window was entirely coincidental.She picked up a stack of photos, every one of them depicting a work by a well-known artist named Joseph Ferris. Either her dad had shifted his interest from antiques to art or else he was planning to become an artthief.Which could also explain the blueprints of what looked to be a sizable estate fanned out on the desk blotter.She'd gotten suspicious when she'd seen the light glowing under the door of her father's study two nights in a row. At midnight. Patrick always went to bed promptly after the ten o'clock news. Both times she'd ignored it, not wanting to draw attention to her late-night forays into the kitchen for leftover wedding cake.But the night before she'd heard the phone ring a few minutes after twelve and then her father's muffled voice on the other side of the door as she padded down the hallway. She'd assumed he was talking to Evie, but when she'd asked about it at breakfast, her father had almost choked on his whole-grain bagel and mumbled something vague about talking to a friend.Right.Suspicious, she'd pushed a special code on the phone and listened to a nice little robotic voice recite the number of the last incoming call. From an area code somewhere in upstate New York.Meghan had to face the truth. Evie's list had turned her into…Evie. But there was no going back now. She had to find out what he was up to.Ever since Patrick had discovered the whereabouts of theNoble,a ship Lake Superior had claimed in the late 1800s, and solved the mystery behind a century-old scandal that had plagued Sophie's family, random people had started to contact him. Some asked for help researching their genealogy while others wanted to hire him to locate missing family heirlooms.In spite of his daughters' initial misgivings, Patrick had actually taken on some \"clients\" over the winter and, judging from the growing number of inquiries, his reputation must have spread.Meghan blew out a sigh. She didn't want to be the wet blanket that snuffed out the fire of enthusiasm in her dad's new hobby, but a person couldn't be too careful nowadays. Hadn't Patrick learned that lesson the summer before, when a man he'd thought he could trust had turned on him and Jacob Cutter while they'd searched for theNoble?She put down a photo of Joseph Ferris's haunting watercolorMomentumand pivoted toward the door. And came nose to nose with her father.\"Meghan.\"\"Dad.\" Meghan crossed her arms and did her best imitation of Caitlin. It must have worked, because a deep red stain crept out from under the collar of her father's oxford shirt and worked its way to his cheekbones.Patrick coughed. \"Ah…I was wondering where you were.\"I'll bet you were.\"It's three o'clock. Tea and cookie time.\"\"My watch must be slow,\" Patrick muttered.Meghan sighed and decided to stop being Evie. And Caitlin. Especially Caitlin. Her suspicions were ridiculous. This was her father. Patrick McBride. The absentminded professor. Mr. Integrity himself.\"Why the sudden interest in Joseph Ferris, Dad? And please tell me that you aren't planning to supplement your retirement income by becoming an art thief.\" Meghan laughed.Patrick didn't. Instead he gave her a thoughtful look. \"Do you think it falls under the label ofstealingif a person is taking something back that technically belonged to them in the first place?\"Meghan groped for the plate of Oreos she'd set on the desk. \"Does the something thattechnicallybelongs to someone else happen to be a work by Ferris?\"\"Yes.\"Meghan shoved a cookie in her mouth. Never mind twisting the two sides apart and delicately scraping out the cream center. \"You're going to…tosteala Joseph Ferris?\"Patrick smiled. \"Of course not. I wouldn't begin to know what an authentic Ferris even looks like.\"\"Well, that's a relief—\"\"That's why I was hoping you'd do it.\"\"Let me get this straight.\"An hour later Meghan had a new appreciation for Evie's suspicions about their dad's dedication to his side business. Her younger sister had tried to warn her, after all. \"A woman named Nina Bonnefield contacted you by e-mail, claiming she knew Ferris personally. He supposedly left a gift for her on an estate he visited in northern Wisconsin almosttwenty yearsago. And she hired you to find it for her.\"\"That's it in a nutshell,\" Patrick said, way too cheerfully in Meghan's opinion.Of their own volition, Meghan's fingers walked across the desk toward the plate of Oreos. Until she realized she'd eaten them all. \"Why doesn't this Nina Bonnefield go back to the estate and retrieve it herself? If it really belongs to her.\"There, she'd said it.\"That's…complicated.\"Of course it was. \"Dad, this whole thing sounds kind of fishy to me. You said she isn't even sure if the gift Ferris left for her was a painting. Maybe it was a coffee mug. Or a souvenir toothpick holder.\"\"For reasons Nina—Ms. Bonnefield—can't share, she can't go back. That's why she needs my help. There's a rumor the island is going up for sale and—\"\"Wait a second. Did you sayisland?\" Meghan interrupted.\"The Halloway estate is on a private island on Blue Key Lake, near the Chequamegon National Forest. It's been in the family for years but they closed it up in the late eighties.\"Halloway. Halloway. The name stirred up something in Meghan's subconscious, but another thought darted in and pushed that one aside for the moment.\"So Nina is somehow related to the family that owns the island?\"Patrick's gaze bounced around the room and finally came to rest on Meghan. \"No offense, but I promised Ms. Bonnefield I'd keep that part confidential. Jacob and I checked out her story, and both of us believe she's telling the truth. She sent me a copy of the letter from Ferris and it does sound as if he left something for her. A thank you of some sort for her friendship and encouragement.\"\"That would be some thank-you,\" Meghan muttered.\"His paintings are valuable?\"\"Paintings, drawings, sculptures. He dabbled in everything. Ferris is one of those artists who gained fame postmortem. By the time the critics finally noticed him and acknowledged his genius, he was in the final stages of pancreatic cancer. The collection of his work isn't all that sizable because his career was short, so what's out there got snapped up right away. If there's still one floating around, I'm sure someone would have noticed. It may have already been sold.\"\"Or tucked away in a closet on an estate in northern Wisconsin.\"And Meghan thoughtshewas an optimist.She tucked her teeth into her bottom lip and tried to figure out a way to discourage her father from getting himself into a potentially sticky situation. And helping oneself to a valuable piece of art definitely fell into that category, no matter who claimed ownership. \"There has to be a way Nina Bonnefield can find out if the Ferris is there without involvingyou.\"\"There is a reason, but I can't tell you what it is. It's—\"\"Confidential. I know.\" She hated to ask the obvious. \"So what's your plan?\"Patrick's eyes lit up and Meghan tried not to groan. Somehow she knew she wasn't going to like the answer.\"The house is going to be opened up temporarily for a family wedding in a few weeks. According to my sources—\"Meghan blinked.His sources?\"—after the wedding, the Halloways plan to auction off the contents of the house before the actual sale of the island goes through. From what I've heard, the family used to be quite a patron of the arts. There's a sizable collection of paintings and sculptures there. I'm more familiar with antiques, so I wouldn't be much help.\"Meghan's eyes narrowed. She had a background in art. She remembered whatherdad had initially said aboutherfinding the Ferris. She'd assumed he'd been kidding. Now she wasn't so sure.\"Dad, please tell me you aren't thinking I'm a shoo-in for the job.\"\"Of course not, sweetheart.\" Patrick looked surprised by the suggestion. \"I told Ms. Bonnefield you're a photographer.\"That much was true. Meghan relaxed a little, relieved she and her dad were on the same page. It didn't sound like either of them would be of much use to the mysterious Ms. Bonnefield. Thank goodness.\"So she decided to find someone else to play Nancy Drew?\"\"Not quite.\" Patrick plucked off his glasses and rubbed them against his shirttail.Warning bells suddenly went off in Meghan's head. That particular gesture meant her father was either nervous—or stalling.\"Daaaad?\"\"I had no idea she was going to pull a few strings.\"\"Whatkindof strings?\"\"Parker Halloway has hired you as her wedding photographer.\"\"Wedding…\" Meghan surged to her feet. \"I don't photographpeople.Didn't you tell Ms. Bonnefield that?\"\"I did.\" Patrick smiled. \"But she made you an offer I couldn't refuse.\"Meghan's teeth rattled in her head as the small fishing boat bounced over the waves toward Blue Key Island. She kept her gaze trained on the slate-shingled roof peeking through a shield of poplar trees. Proof, at least, that one of Nina Bonnefield's claims was true. The Halloway house really did exist.Meghan sincerely hoped the woman hadn't been making up the rest of the story.She still couldn't believe she'd adjusted her work schedule to accommodate a visit to the Halloway estate in the first place.

I wasn't wrong, and we both know it.\"Wallace leaned closer, his thin lips compressed and his faded blue eyes filled with rage. He smelled musty and old. \"So help me God, you're going to be sorry you crossed me.\"\"What are you going to do to me, Wallace? Send me to jail?\" Zoe smiled. \"Been there, done that.\"She heard a quick intake of breath from another customer.\"You never were smart enough to back off, were you?\" He raised his fist. \"You're interfering in my personal life. I don't allow anyone to do that.\"She glanced at his fist. \"You want to hit me? Go ahead.\" Her gaze bored into his. \"You'll have lots of witnesses. Or don't you hit women in front of other people?\"Wallace shoved his finger in her face. \"I'm going to say this one more time, Zoe. You tell Sally you were mistaken. Or you'll regret it.\"Zoe grabbed his finger. \"Don't point at me.\" She'd been trying to keep her composure, telling herself that Wallace Tate was a pathetic old man. But now her anger sparked. \"Get out of here, Wallace.\" She shoved his hand away from her face.The older man stumbled backward, his face scarlet with fury. He took a step toward her, then stopped. He seemed puzzled as he swayed, then staggered to the side. As he started to crumple to the floor, Zoe dropped her coffee and grabbed him. She managed to shield his head from the table, but she couldn't stop him from hitting the floor.\"Wallace?\" She unbuttoned his wool coat and put her hand on his chest, felt his heart beating way too fast. He tried to speak, but no sound came out of his mouth. His eyes were moving, but he didn't seem to see her. The coffee she'd dropped stained his coat and slacks, and the smell of it was sharp and bitter.Looking up at the shocked faces surrounding her, she said, \"Someone call 9-1-1.\"* * *The light from the ambulance pulsed steadily outside the window of the coffee shop, a red heartbeat of anxiety. She closed her eyes to shut out the flashing. But it wouldn't go away. It bounced off the walls and into her brain, a steady, continual reminder of the last time she'd called for an ambulance.She had to be dreaming. This couldn't be happening again.Another Tate removed on a gurney.Another police car stationed behind the ambulance.What had happened to Wallace? She headed outside, intending to ask the paramedics. Why had he collapsed so suddenly? Was it a heart attack?A blast of fresh spring air met her as she opened the door, and she stopped abruptly. Wallace Tate was on the gurney, parked at the back of the ambulance. Two paramedics labored over him. When they moved, she realized they'd been strapping him in.She felt unexpected pity for the man who lay helpless in front of her. Wallace Tate, her nemesis for the past six years, reduced to a pathetic old man. Wallace would hate that. Her compassion would be unbearable to him. With one last look at the ambulance, she turned back into the shop.\"You watching the show, Zoe? Getting a kick out of it?\"Ray Dobbs, the chief of police, crowded behind her in the doorway. His blue eyes were cold and his gray buzz cut looked like a stiff brush. His whole body bristled with indignation.\"I was feeling sorry for Wallace,\" she said, holding his gaze. \"Don't you think that's ironic?\"\"I'm not finding much to laugh about.\"\"That's your problem, Chief. You don't have a sense of humor.\"Dobbs flushed. \"Watch your mouth, Zoe. You're already in enough trouble.\"Zoe tried to hold on to her temper. \"What do you mean? I have no idea what happened to Wallace.\"\"He just fell over.\" Dobbs's eyes glittered. \"For no reason.\"\"Exactly.\" Despite her fear, Zoe steeled her face into an expression of polite interest. It was a talent she'd perfected during her marriage. \"We were talking and he collapsed.\"\"Talking?\" Dobbs edged closer, his expression hard with suspicion. \"Is that what you call it?\" He nodded to the other customers, milling around in small groups and murmuring to one another. \"Maybe we should ask them if you were just 'talking.'\"\"Wallace was angry. That shouldn't come as a shock to you. He's been angry with me for six years. He got a little loud.\"\"What were you 'talking' about?\" Dobbs sneered.Zoe dug her nails into her palms. \"It was personal. It's no one else's business.\"\"You don't think so?\" Dobbs moved so close she felt his breath on her face. \"You better lose the attitude, or I'll toss your ass in a cell while we sort out what really happened.\"\"Don't think you can intimidate me, Chief. It's not going to work. Better men than you have tried, starting with Wallace Tate.\" Instead of moving away, she held her ground. She kept her gaze steady and concentrated on breathing evenly. \"You can't arrest me because a man fell sick in front of me.\"\"Wallace was angry and you had a fight.\" Dobbs's mouth thinned.\"I didn't say that.\"\"He got in your face. Did you shove him? Is that why he fell down?\"\"Of course not! I didn't touch him.\" But she had, she remembered with a burst of fear. She'd pushed his hand away.Dobbs scanned the café. \"Lots of witnesses here. Let's see what they have to say.\" He pointed to a chair. \"Sit down. And stay there.\"\"I'm not going to sit down. You can't keep me here.\"The chief of police turned red. \"You're a pain in the ass. You know that, Zoe?\"\"I get that a lot,\" Zoe said. \"Mostly when men are trying to bully me to get at a woman in the shelter.\" She took a deep breath. She knew better than to let Dobbs push her buttons.\"Chief, the paramedic has a question for you.\" Jamie Evans, the patrol officer who'd responded to the 9-1-1 call, stepped into the shop. \"He's outside.\"Dobbs hitched up his navy blue uniform pants, then turned and walked out the door. As soon as he was gone, Zoe dropped into one of the old-fashioned wooden chairs. This wasn't like six years ago, she told herself. No one was dead and she hadn't done anything. There was nothing to worry about.Except that Wallace Tate was involved. That changed everything.She pulled her cell phone out of her jacket, watching Dobbs return and begin questioning the other customers. When her attorney answered, she said, \"Helen, I have a problem. Wallace Tate collapsed while he was talking to me, and Dobbs is making noises about arresting me.\"\"What?\" Her attorney's voice rose. \"You got into a fight with Tate?\"\"No!\" Zoe reached down and picked up the coffee cup she'd dropped earlier. No one had mopped up the coffee. \"He came into Joe's yelling at me, shook his finger in my face, then fell down. That's it.\"\"Don't say a word and don't lose your temper,\" Helen said sharply.\"Too late.\" Zoe watched the paramedics loading Wallace into the ambulance.\"Zoe, haven't you learned—\" Helen bit off the words. \"Sorry. Don't say anything else. If all you were doing was talking, Dobbs can't arrest you.\"\"That wouldn't stop him. Wallace is on his way to the hospital and Dobbs is scared. Who knows what he'll do?\" Zoe swallowed. \"I need you here, Helen.\"\"I'm thirty minutes away in Green Bay taking a deposition.\" Zoe heard her attorney shuffling papers. \"It'll take me a couple of hours to finish up, but I'll get there as fast as I can.\"\"Hurry, Helen.\" As she spoke, Dobbs swung away from a table and headed toward her, his face triumphant. \"I'm getting a bad feeling here.\"\"I'll call the office and see if anyone else is available. Hang on, Zoe. I won't let them lock you up.\"\"Okay,\" Zoe said, shuddering as she imagined the walls of a jail cell pressing in on her.\"Stay calm, Zoe.\"\"I'll try.\"\"Do better than try. Don't give Dobbs any more ammunition.\" Helen's voice was grim as she hung up.Zoe closed the phone, took a deep breath and sat up straight as Dobbs reached her.His eyes gleamed maliciously. \"You said you didn't touch Wallace,\" he said. \"You want to rethink that statement?\"\"I didn't push him.\"\"That's not the story I'm hearing.\" He jerked his head toward two women who'd gone to high school with Zoe. They wouldn't meet her eyes. \"Mary Ellen and Tina said you pushed him.\"\"They're wrong,\" Zoe said. She tried to control her growing panic.\"Witnesses say otherwise.\" He reached behind him and brought out handcuffs, which flashed in the light. \"Zoe McInnes, you're under arrest…\"The scene with Wallace flashed in front of her again, and she swallowed. \"He was shaking his finger in my face and I pushed it away. That's all.\"\"That's battery. And you're under arrest. Turn around.\" He dangled the handcuffs in front of her.\"Then you're going to have to arrest Wallace, too.\"\"Don't tell me how to do my job, McInnes.\"\"Someone has to. No judge will let you get away with this.\"\"Doesn't matter.\" Dobbs leaned closer and lowered his voice. \"Maybe I can't hold you for more than a few hours, but that's enough to get your name in the paper. 'Zoe McInnes, head of Safe Harbor Women's Shelter, arrested for battery.' How's that sound? I think Wallace will like it.\"Zoe stared at the police chief. \"I know you're Wal-lace's main butt-kisser because you want him to give you a job at the college, but isn't this going a little too far, even for you, Chief? That shelter does a lot of good. It's where your police officers bring domestic-violence victims.\"\"You should have thought...", "related": ["B009YF44ZY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After nine years in Jesuit schools, he went to Edinburgh University, receiving a degree in medicine in 1881. He then became an eye specialist in Southsea, with a distressing lack of success. Hoping to augment his income, he wrote his first story,A Study in Scarlet. His detective, Sherlock Holmes, was modeled in part after Dr. Joseph Bell of the Edinburgh Infirmary, a man with spectacular powers of observation, analysis, and inference. Conan Doyle may have been influenced also by his admiration for the neat plots of Gaboriau and for Poe’s detective, M. Dupin. After several rejections, the story was sold to a British publisher for £25, and thus was born the world’s best-known and most-loved fictional detective. Fifty-nine more Sherlock Holmes adventures followed. Once, wearying of Holmes, his creator killed him off, but was forced by popular demand to resurrect him. Sir Arthur—he had been knighted for this defense of the British cause in his The Great Boer War—became an ardent Spiritualist after the death of his son Kingsley, who had been wounded at the Somme in World War I. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died in Sussex in 1930.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bremmer, born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, has carried a passion for mysteries and word puzzles since childhood when she devoured every Perry Mason book she could find. She rarely left a word scramble unsolved in the Omaha World Herald paper during her elementary school years. Her fondness for libraries and bookstores never waned. Bremmer traveled across the United States with her thoroughbred racehorses for fifteen years before taking her experiences and settling down to a quiet place in western Nebraska. Bremmer collaborated with a screenplay writer to write her first novel Tryst With Dolphins. She did so out of pure frustration with so many unbelievable mystery stories in film and print full of I would never do that & that would never happen moments, where reality gets lost and clues for the reader never exist.  After the success of her first novel Bremmer penned a sequel titled Dolphins' Echo. Her third book Death Foreshadowed cemented the role of her sleuth, Detective Glen Karst. Victim Wanted: Must Have References, the fourth book in her series brings Detective Karst s personal life to center stage. Bremmer's dear friend, Detective Karst, is also a real person, and an active member of law enforcement in Denver Colorado. His extensive background in homicide investigation, drug work, and SWAT make certain that Bremmer's stories remain true to life and believable. Since Detective Karst is rare, even among a select few in law enforcement, Bremmer incorporated him into her novels as her sleuth. The real detective is handsome, charming, and has a genuine respect for all people he encounters on and off the job. Detectives are usually not complimented on their decency by the suspects they are arresting, but Karst is an exception to that fact. Not only does the real and fictional Detective Karst take crime solving to the extreme, he looks good doing it!  As a source of insider humor Bremmer has used the names and likenesses of people she has met during her travels across the U.S. with the horses. She is often asked if a certain character is meant to be a mutual acquaintance to which Bremmer only replies Maybe! All of Bremmer's novels contain an Elusive Clue word puzzle hidden somewhere in the book. The puzzle is varied in each book but when the letters are unscrambled it always names the murderer. Bremmer is complimented often with her unique writing style. She writes with a quick stride keeping the story alive and the characters hopping. Light mystery readers can breeze through the books in a weekend while the desires of serious mystery purists will be quenched with a plot that challenges the mind. Either way Bremmer's fans are always satisfied with this new approach to the solvable whodunits. Bremmer is the mother of three. She has six grandchildren. Together with her husband, Martin, they own and operate a dog kennel (a childhood dream). She has shown, trained and raised dogs for over thirty years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has had over 50 books published. He has sold over four million books, and is in demand as a team-building, life-changing, and leadership speaker and consultant for his Who Dares Wins: The Green Beret Way concept, which he translated into Write It Forward: a holistic program teaching writers how to be authors. He is also the Co-Creator of Cool Gus Publishing, which does both eBooks and Print On Demand, so he has experience in both traditional and non-traditional publishing. His books have hit the NY Times, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal and numerous other bestseller lists. His book The Jefferson Allegiance, was released independently and reached #2 overall in sales on Nook. Bob Mayer grew up in the Bronx. After high school, he entered West Point where he learned about the history of our military and our country. During his four years at the Academy and later in the Infantry, Mayer questioned the idea of \"mission over men.\" When he volunteered and passed selection for the Special Forces as a Green Beret, he felt more at ease where the men were more important than the mission. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. In his historical fiction novels, Mayer blends actual events with fictional characters. He doesn't change history, but instead changes how history came into being. Mayer's military background, coupled with his deep desire to understand the past and how it affects our future, gives his writing a rich flavor not to be missed.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.2941, "rating_total": 73.0}

The family is struggling to keep their farm from the clutches of a ne'er-do-well uncle, when their snobby, rich cousins arrive to avoid the bombing in London. Just when all seems hopeless, Nanny McPhee arrives with her magic stick to save the day. Read by the author (and Nanny McPhee herself), Academy Award-winner Emma Thompson alternates chapters between the story and the behind-the-scenes film diary. Thompson's intimate narrative feels as though she's letting you in on the joke. The diary offers a fascinating look at the making of a movie, filled with insider knowledge and hilarious asides.

The story, a romance, ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life. She later wrote three unpublished novels, developing her skills as a writer while living on a remote lighthouse during what she thinks of as her baby-making, basket weaving, beach-walking days.     In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition.     Over the years her love of storytelling and her curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also an accountant, a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and a popular international speaker with considerable media experience.     Vanessa and her husband have lived on an island in the Pacific Northwest since they returned from a two year sailing cruise to Mexico some years ago. Vanessa loves hearing from readers.", "related": ["B00BFX8DZU"], "rank": 1916872, "title": "The Chauvinist (Canadian West Coast Romances Book 3)", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The plane in which they are passengers crashes, leaving only the 2 students alive. These two students coming from different social classes, having only each other and the resources around them on the deserted island, must stick together in this game of survival. After reading this book, I really sat and thought what it would really be like to be stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere with no civilization and no helpful resources such as a phone or any type of communication device. The descriptive words used in this book made it much easier to visualize the setting, which was really cool. I could totally feel the fear they felt not knowing if they would ever leave the island. I also liked how in the book, both students are from two different social classes, but had to put all of that behind when survival was at hand. The only thing I didn t like was the fact that Todd did not express his feelings to Crystal, I feel like they went through too much on that island for him not to express the way he felt about her, I felt as if maybe she kind of knew but he still should have expressed himself. My favorite character in the book was Todd. He reminds me of myself, no matter what you are dealing with, always try to keep your composure and that is exactly what he did. Todd remained calm through some of the toughest times, especially right after the accident when he thought he was alone, before he discovered Crystal. He cared for her and made her feel comfortable the entire time they were on the island. In conclusion, Survival is a very visual, exciting, adventurous book to read that will have your mind traveling along with it. It is a great read and I encourage anyone who likes a good book to read it. --Martavaian MannSurvival is about two high school students Crystal Blake and Todd Barrington, who are from two completely different social groups. Crystal has the title for the prettiest girl at school and besides of her looks she comes from a wealthy family. On the other hand, Todd is a shy person who is very good with his hands. Crystal and Todd both selected to go to Cambridge University , to compete for a full four-year scholarship. Before their journey could truly began a turn for the worst happen. Running into a storm, on their way to Cambridge University , the plane had to do an emergency landing, leaving Crystal and Todd the only two alive. I would have to say my favorite character in the book was Todd. Because Todd was always, the perfect gentleman no matter what situation they ran into. Throughout the story, it seem like he always caught himself saving Crystal, from the time of the crash to the snake bit on her leg. Todd never stops caring about her. While they were there on the island, Todd did anything to make the campsite as livable for Crystal as much as he could. The only thing I did not like was that Todd never told Crystal how he felt. What I liked about this book is that it was easy to imagine all the events that took place within the plot. In addition, it taught me to go speak what is on my mind, because I might ever have the chance to say what I may want to say. What I did not like was how he put Crystal as a person who could not do much. It seems to me that he was trying to say that a woman could not do anything without a man s help. Over all if you like love and suspense books, you will like this book. I give it 4 Â½ stars. --Kayla RogersThe book survival is about two high school students by the names of Crystal Blake and Todd Barrington.

Crystal for one is fr --Ja'Sheia Gee< --Ja'Sheia GeeThis story is about two teenagers who developed a strong relationship, during a crisis. Todd Barrington was a seventeen year old high school junior. He was the type of person who didn't make a lot of friends because of the way he dressed or because he didn't have a lot of money. On the other hand, Crystal Blake was the most popular girl in school. She was very pretty, and she was a member of the cheerleading squad. Todd and Crystal attended the same school and never said a word to each other. They didn't have anything in common, except they both were smart. The two juniors were called to the office because they had been selected to visit the most prestigious Cambridge University for a chance to receive a four-year scholarship. This was very exciting for the teens, but the only catch was that they had to pay eight hundred dollars to attend the trip. This was no problem for Crystal because her parents were wealthy. Todd, on the other hand, wasn't as fortunate as Crystal. Todd became very stressed because he didn't know how he would come up with the money. Crystal secretly had a crush on Todd, but she didn't want anybody to know because of her reputation at school. Crystal had a big heart because she knew Todd didn't have the money for the trip, so she took money from her trust fund to pay his fee. Todd was very excited when he heard his fee had been paid anonymously. The teens boarded the plane expecting to have the time of their lives. They were going to meet teens from other countries and would be able to experience a new culture. This trip that was planned to be exciting turned into a disaster. The plan course had led them into a terrible storm, which caused the plane to crash. After the plane crashed, Todd thought he was the only survivor, but Crystal had also survived. These two immediately thought they were going to starve to death. Todd immediately took a brave role. He tended to Crystal's wounds from the crash. While the two were on this deserted island for a year, Todd made sure the two of them had food, water, and shelter. He made this tragedy feel more comfortable. The two teenagers had never exchanged words until this happened. They had become the best of friends and actually fell in love with each other. Their friendship had become such a tight bond because they started to feel as if they couldn't live without each other. Todd was such a brave young man. He didn't just make sure he and Crystal ate for a whole year but he risked his life so they could return home to their families. My favorite part of the book was when Todd risked his life and was captured by the smugglers. Todd had a plan the whole time he was being captured by the smugglers. Todd blew the vessel up and the fire was the reason for Crystal being rescued. My other favorite part of the book was when Crystal returned to the island because she thought Todd had died in the explosion, and she didn't want her friend's grave to be under water. When Crystal arrived on the island, she discovered that Todd wasn't dead and he left her a message in the sand that said, \"Crystal I Survived I Love You.\" I am not a person who likes to read but I would read this book repeatedly. This book actually brought tears to my eyes. I would recommend this book to anybody because it is very touching, and it makes you realize that some things shouldn't be taken for granted. --Latia AlexanderThe book survival is about two high school students by the names of Crystal Blake and Todd Barrington. Some interesting little facts about the two are basically that they both are from two different worlds. Crystal for one is from a more wealthy family and is the more outgoing, pretty and popular girl while Todd on the other hand is somewhat of a shy guy who is very good with his hands. What brings these two together is a chance to compete for a full four year ride to Cambridge University. Before either student had the chance to compete in such a wonderful experience, their exciting journey turned into an awful nightmare. While headed to the university, their plane encountered a horrible storm which caused the plan to make an emergency landing killing everyone, but Crystal and Todd.  While being able to read this novel I really enjoyed the thrill and dramatic scenes that I came across. I especially enjoyed learning more about the character Todd seeing how he was out of his comfort zone, mainly being around such a beautiful girl and being able to help her out as well as for his self. He seemed like the perfect guy and gentlemen towards Crystal which is shocking to me. For these two young students being able to at least survive without any type of communication or help from others is amazing.  I personally would recommend this novel to anyone willing to read up on something different with a little edge and suspense to it. If I enjoyed it, I know anyone else would. --Ja'Sheia Gee", "related": ["B007OON60Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rose Aubrey picks up her tale in the 1920s, after the deaths of her mother and brother. Though still troubled in spirit, Rose and her sister Mary are at last secure financially as established concert pianists. Sought after by society, they prefer clinging to those they have loved since childhood. They are shaken by the loss of their cherished cousin Rosamund, who leaves England after her inexplicable marriage to a rich vulgarian. Rose comes close to breaking down but is restored by unexpected romance and a happy marriage. West's impressive style once again makes up for the overall unfinished quality of the narrative, and readers intrigued by the earlier volumes will not want to miss this one, nor West's synopsis of the entire Aubrey saga, reprinted in the afterword.

As an engineer, he first worked in trajectory analysis (for orbital and planetary entry space vehicles) and then transitioned to programming computers to solve engineering problems and analyze and display engineering data. The transition was serendipitous, because humans are notoriously poor at the kind of logic required for programming, and programmers consequently spend much of their time \"debugging\" ... figuring out why a complex program behaved the way it actually did instead of the way that had been expected; this turned out to be excellent training for figuring out why we, complex humans, behave the way we do instead of the way that's expected. Throughout his engineering years Adam's inclination toward philosophy and his natural interest in the life sciences kept him constantly reading and studying to stay abreast of the ongoing discoveries in everything from anthropology to zoology. As a result, when neuroscientists studying the brain began to publish popular summaries of their work, Adam recognized that their findings provided the key \"missing\" data that would finally allow understanding Man's behavior. In his book, \"Man by Nature: The Hidden Programming Controlling Human Behavior,\" Adam describes this new and seminal brain research, shows how it enables a sweeping new \"Tribal Programming Theory of Human Behavior,\" and considers the impact the new knowledge will have on Man's quest to eventually live in peace.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What a ride down the rapids of the Columbia River this novel is!  Set in the early 1800 s the story of The McKannahs unfolds when Sean Brennan McKannah is orphaned in Dublin, Ireland, at the age of thirteen.  Captain Mullholland takes the Irish lad to heart and Sean soon finds himself onboard the trading ship the Sea Duchess, heading for high seas of adventure to ports around the world.    Yerba Buena   now renamed San Francisco - is where Sean McKannah will begin a new life, trapping in the mountains with his Spanish friend Francisco.  It will be a life long friendship they share; Sean McKannah marries Francisco s  homely  sister Isabella.   Trading posts in California supply goods to trappers while lawlessness is settled with instant justice from the McKannah boys.  Jesse McKannah is the youngest son of six McKannah offspring; he will grow to become the legendary White Buffalo.  His protective love of Aleena would never leave him.   White Buffalo is one day challenged for his courage in a village on the Columbia River by a drunken Umatilla brave who trades for the white mans  whiskey.  Moon Dog swings the red umbrella he carries in falling snow, Jesse McKannah ducks the waving blow to attack his rage with, \"Are you the camp news boy, or the snow fairy?\"  The icy Columbia River douses the effects of the white mans  firewater when the Chief of the Umatilla throws Moon Dog into the flow.  White Buffalo shows concern, but he need not worry, it is a monthly ritual.  There are so many priceless moments in The McKannahs.  Rick Magers is the storyteller who keeps you enthralled as he sits by the campfire unfolding this story.    Readers will be rushing to buy the soon to be released sequel -- The McKannahs: together Again, once they have read this novel. --Australian book promotion website--Rolling Seas .The McKannahs is the epic story of a tough Irish family that settles in nineteenth century California.  It is also the story of the plight of the Spanish Californios whose culture was crushed by the land-hungry Anglos, and a chronicle of the tragic devastation of California's Native Americans by the settlers' greed and prejudice. Sean McKannah was born in Ireland.  When his family is killed in a fire he runs away to sea to find a better life.  He is befriended by the captain of his ship and supported by this friend as he matures.  McKannah leaves the sea in California to go gold hunting. He falls in love, marries, has a family and makes his place in California.  This is the thrilling story of his adventures and adventures of his sons. One of Sean's sons becomes a Texas Ranger. Two become lawyers.  Another is an honest professional gambler.  His very special fifth son, Jesse, becomes the legendary \"White Buffalo,\" friend to the California Native Americans. Neither the Irish, the Californios, nor the Native Americans were fully accepted by other Americans during the nineteenth century.  Magers has woven a great story around the triumphs and tragedies of the settlement of western America. The McKannahs is a mixture of historical fact and well-crafted fiction that holds the reader's interest to the last page and leaves you wishing for more. I look forward to reading the sequel: The McKannahs: together again. --Independant book reviewer and author--Anne Holt.In 1780 Dublin, Sean Brennan McKannah was born in a tiny apartment near the docks. When Sean was thirteen, a fire killed his family leaving him as an impoverished orphan. With nothing to keep him in Ireland, Sean finds work on a ship headed by Captain Patrick Mullholland, who likes the lad s courage. Eventually Sean leaves his mentor to begin work as a trapper. He and his partner, Francisco \"Frank\" de Rivera Santiago make a go of it in the San Francisco area. Sean marries Frank s sister Issabella \"Bella\". They lovingly raise five sons and a daughter; all born between 1802 and 1807. However, Sean and Bella soon realize that their six children will go their own way regardless of how much their parents love them and want the best for them. Their journeys have begun. Patrick and Broderick head east wanting to become lawyers; Ian loves to gamble; Simon thinks of joining the Texas Rangers; Jesse seeks solace and salvation perhaps with an Indian tribe; and finally Aleena, who struggles to find happiness. THE McKANNAHS is a superb late eighteenth to mid nineteenth century family saga that readers will fully enjoy. The key players are an ensemble, but each has a distinct personality that makes them seem very real and in turn enables the audience to fully appreciate life in Ireland and especially in North America. Though the book may have been better off as seven novels that would allow expansion of Sean s salad days, Rick Magers provides a deep drama that vividly brings to life a bygone period like few tales ever do.

I haven't read them all, but I have yet to read a novel that approaches the subject as I do in High Ground. While writing the story, I made a conscience effort to view the period through the eyes of someone living at that time, characters who don't have the advantage of hindsight. I point that out because it's only in hindsight that we recognize the success of Lincoln's presidency and his handling of the crisis that threatened the nation. At the same time, we have simplified the conflict to a single issue, slavery. I don't deny that slavery was a critical factor, but I believe the issues dividing the nation were more complicated, and yet, all those issues are first and foremost about power-political and economic power, which was divided between competing regional interests-North and South.A driving force behind that power struggle was the competing interpretations of the Constitution: Was the union of the states perpetual, or was it a compact that could be dissolved? In other words, what are states' rights? A hundred and fifty years later, that question is still unanswered-with one exception. The war decided that state's are not free to leave the Union at will. Otherwise, the struggle to maintain the balance of power between the federal and state governments continues.*In High Ground, I attempt to provide a broader framework within which to view the War Between the States. From there, I tell the story of a man who dedicated his life to serving, protecting and defending his country, but sees the freedom and democracy guaranteed in the Constitution, everything he is fighting for, being sacrificed in Lincoln's efforts to save the Union.If I have learned anything in the process of writing my novel, it is that in one way or another history repeats itself. During times of war, we still have to ask ourselves what freedoms will we sacrifice, or can we sacrifice, and still be America?*Neither the Emancipation Proclamation nor the war ended slavery in America. The war did make it possible to adopt the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Bill of Rights, which ended slavery and provided citizenship to the former slaves.", "related": ["B00E3BVJ7A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The volume's careful attention to the complexity of identity construction in the Ottoman Empire contributes important nuance to the Armenian Genocide narrative, highlighting dynamics that transcend Turkish-Armenian relations within the empire.\" --World History Connected\"The book as a whole is indeed something much larger than the sum of its parts...This volume presents new and important research that will make it required reading for any scholar in the field or on any course syllabus on the topic.\" --The Historian\"As a scholarly addition to the understanding  of the Armenian genocide, the late Ottoman Empire, and the beginning of the Turkish Republic--A Question of Genocidesucceeds.\" --H-Net\"Nearly a century on from the attempted Ottoman destruction of the Armenians, Turkish politics of denial, on the one hand, and an Armenian mythic representation of a singular Turkish guilt, on the other, have repeatedly sabotaged chances for dialogue. Yet in this book a group of leading historians from both sides of the divide, and beyond, demonstrate that the reality of genocide can be examined in its multi-causal dimensions not only without partisanship but in recognition of a shared history.  A Question of Genocide can be read as a breakthrough historical study providing a contextualized, nuanced yet sensitive set of interpretations of an Armenian-but also wider Ottoman- tragedy. Equally, however, it may come to be remembered as a timely intervention on the path to reconciliation between post-Ottoman peoples.\" -Mark Levene, University of Southampton\"Although the Armenian genocide is probably the clearest case of that crime apart from the Holocaust, for political reasons it has been one of the more controversial.A Question of Genocideoffers valuable new studies of this very important topic, written by some of the leading experts in the field, including both Armenian and Turkish scholars. It carries on the work of the courageous Turkish Armenian writer Hrant Dink, who was assassinated in Istanbul in 2007.\"-Ben Kiernan, author ofBlood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her dreams never misled\nher.\"Indeed, I am,\" he answered, relieving her fears. He paused briefly, and then continued, \"But there is no Mrs. Collins.\"Comprehension dawned. The blush of embarrassment and dread crept up her\nneck. To her surprise, Mr. Collins stiffened in agitation.\"I-I am truly sorry,\" she stated, suddenly understanding his reaction.\nAt least, now it made sense why Mrs. Collins never entered her dreams.\n\"I had not realized she had passed. I apologize for the grief I have\nsurely inflicted on you.\"\"No, no,\" he said, with a shake of his head. He appeared to have\ndifficulty speaking for a moment until at last, with a deep breath, he\nreclaimed his composure. Still, he kept his eyes cast down, toward the\nfire. \"You fail to understand. I have never married.\"Melora stared at him. Confused, she looked again at the letter in her hand. \"But the letters...?\"This time, his head snapped up, and he looked in her direction. She\ninhaled sharply at the sight of his light blue eyes staring at her. Into\n her. Through her. Sharp. Piercing. As if he searched her soul for the\nanswers to his questions.", "related": ["B009JF5MO6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In fact, the town could almost be considered a character in itself. The plots in both these stories are many layered. It doesn't matter whether or not you guess the solution to the mysteries, though you may change your mind several times. The enjoyment of them lies in who, how, and why, rather than in what. TRIPLE THREAT offers two entertaining cozy mysteries in one. Why not take advantage of this good deal? And if you haven't read the earlier novels, I highly recommend them as well.--Jane Bowers, Romance Reviews TodayMs. Dearl offers a double dose of engaging mystery in Triple Threat.  In Buyer's Remorse, Taylor Madison charges to the rescue when her friend gets a steal of a deal as she buys a house at auction. Stealthy footsteps and a mournful ghost soon convince them that the deal is too good to be true.  Triple Threat revolves around a man's dying wish to reconcile his grown triplets: Lily, Rose, and Iris.  A simple provision in his Will sparks a complicated dance of personalities and intrigues as old secrets threaten the sisters' bequests.  Triple Threat offers many a chuckle on its blithe trip through the cobwebs of human behavior. I had some difficulty putting the book down, but no matter.  I'll get the laundry done another day.  For readers in search of light entertainment, both intriguing and amusing, Triple Threat is a winner.--Jeanette Cottrell, Reviewer, eBook Reviews Weekly", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His learning was gleaned mainly from his Father's library at home in Camberwell, South London, where he learnt something, with his Father's help, of Latin and Greek and also read Shelly, Byron and Keats. Though he attended lectures at the University of London in 1828, Browning left after only one session. Apart from a visit to St Petersburg in 1834 and two visits to Italy in 1838 and 1844, Browning lived with his parents in London until his marriage of 1846. It was during this period that most of the plays and the earlier poems were written and, excepting Strafford, published at his family's expense. After the secretly held marriage to Elizabeth Barrett in 1846, Browning and wife travelled to Italy where they were, apart from brief holidays in France and England, to spend most of their married life together. In 1849 the couple had a son, Robert 'Pen' Browning, and it was Elizabeth who, during this time, was most productive. After her death in 1861, Browning returned to England with his son, where he achieved popular acclaim for his Dramatis Personae and The Ring and the Book. He spent the remainder of his life, excepting holidays in France, Scotland, Italy and Switzerland, in London where he wrote a number of dramatic poems, the two series of Dramatic Idylls (1879,1880) and poems on primarily classical subjects: Balaustion's Adventure (1871) and Aristophone's Apology (1875). He died in Venice whilst holidaying in 1889 and was buried at Westminster Abbey.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Domino Project, a new publishing venture created by Seth Godin and Powered by Amazon, launched this initiative after the release of Godin’s newest best-selling book,Poke the Box, started asking people to do just that: create a ruckus. Here is a sampling of some of the many inspiring examples you will find inside this free Kindle edition.The Power of $10 IdeasAmy M. McMillan [is] the Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commissioner in Flint, Michigan. Faced with [having to cut her budget], Amy turned to her think tank – her staff – for help. Her plan to balance the budget began with an invitation to staff to suggest cost-cutting initiatives that would each save the Genesee County Parks $10. She hoped the staffs’ ideas would be able to save the parks between $25,000 and $40,000. Before long, dozens of ideas were submitted, evaluated and implemented. Practical suggestions were in place quickly: Cell phones used by seasonal staff were put on “vacation” mode to save monthly fees. Computers, screens and typewriters were turned off at night. Amy agreed to let the staff wear blue jeans instead of the uniform pants that are provided to them. Sand, which is cheap and plentiful, was used in place of salt for snow and ice control where possible. Staff also suggested lengthening the routine mowing cycle by one day to save fuel and labor, and they advocated for a new “grow not mow” philosophy by enhancing natural features of the parks and reducing areas that need to be regularly mowed. A suggested “office supply round-up” generated bins and boxes of unused office supplies taking up space in desks, drawers and shelves. Those supplies were, in turn, made available to staff who needed them, saving on the purchase of new supplies and reducing duplicates. Trophies were switched from mugs to less expensive medals. Even a step as simple as changing the default to black on the color copier saved money by eliminating accidental expensive color printing. By year’s end, the savings totaled a whopping $167,000, enabling jobs to be retained and park services to continue. [T]hat savings of $167,000 kept parks staff employed, [and] it helped keep others in the county employed as well. Many of the savings realized will continue to make a difference in the Parks Commissions bottom line for years to come, because staff have changed forever they way they do things. While she gives full credit for the success of the savings campaign to her employees and members of the Commission, it’s Amy’s signature enthusiasm that gets people fired up and eager to work with her, and her “never say never” attitude that that leads to finding creative solutions for even the toughest problems.Supermom: The Story of Dr. L. P. Charie[Ninety year old Dr. L. P. Charie] spent last year literally getting an act of congress passed. And she succeeded, in record time—than a year. Reading through the means test levels for veterans medical benefits, she discovered how outdated and unfair they were. To qualify for care at the veterans hospital, the veteran was asked: Are you a full time student? Are you a full time farmer? and so on. What 80 or 90 year old WW2 vet is a full time farmer or student? It was grossly unfair. These are the people who served and who need care the most, our senior veterans, frail and alone, many of them. Mom wrote her governor; he ignored her. She wrote her congressman, on the veterans committee; he ignored her. She enlisted the aid of a brigadier general, a woman who runs the Women’s Memorial in Washington, and that got action. Mom talked the General's aid for 45 minutes. Mom submitted her work, a detailed review of paragraph and line of each form that needed to change. Within a year, it was done. Mom went to the Vets hospital and read over them. Not only were they changed correctly, but they were done in blue ink so that the change was visible. In a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy, the military and the congress, she effected meaningful change within a very reasonable time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 52.0}

Overpopulation,\nwhich has resulted in a lack of food and farmland, has given the government the\npower to cull citizens. When Cassie is found out, her young son is taken from\nher and she is told she must either offer herself up to be euthanized on a\nnationally televised show or sacrifice her child. But Cassie escapes and eventually finds herself an\noutsider amongst a group of rebels. When a mission goes awry, Cassie and a\nhandful of the rebels, including their leader, are captured--and the only\nsolution is another mission, the price of which may be too high.

How did it come about,\nAndrew?A1:\nWhen I got finished with my first short story collection I stood back and\nnoticed three overarching devices running through the tales. The three words\nall began with the letter M and I went for it.Q2:\nWhat about the word \"Memphistopheles\"? That's not how I remember Mephistopheles\nbeing spelled.A2:\nThe spell checker must have missed it. And it's in the title. How embarrassing.Q3:\nCome on.A3:\nMemphistopheles is the title of one of the stories in the collection. The story\nis based in Memphis and I only had to add one letter to Mephistopheles to make\nit a composite of the setting and a certain devilish character who appears in\nit. I can't say much more or it will give away the story.Q4:\nSo you've coined a term?A4:\n(Smiles)Q5:\nDid you have input on the cover?A5:\nLots of it, as I always do. It's hard to understand how authors give up control\nof their cover designs. Many big publishing houses treat the cover as separate\nfrom the book. Some designer creates the cover who has never read a page of the\nbook. To me the cover is intricately entwined with the text of the book. They\neach flow into the other and form each other into one art package. Many times\nwhen I am writing a story or novel an ideal picture will pop into my head and I\nensure it is included on the cover. Other times, like \"The Mailbox War\" in this\ncollection, a photograph or object gives me the idea for the story. To me,\nlaunching a book with someone else designing the cover is like having a\nstranger dress me in the morning. They have no idea of my tastes, size, mood,\nor what I am doing that day. As an artist I would feel awkward having a\nstranger dress my book. Nine times out of ten they would get the feel and\natmosphere of it all wrong. I try to create the total experience.Q6:\nWhere did the photos of the mailboxes on the cover come from?A6:\nMy wife is a talented photographer. She did the coffee cup shot on the front ofCoffee\nwith Poe: A Novel of Edgar Allan Poe's Life, too. One day we were driving\ndown a country road near the Tennessee - Mississippi border and noticed mailbox\nafter mailbox with lavish contraptions mounted on them to ward off baseball\nbats. That was the seed for \"The Mailbox War.\" We went back later and she took\nphotos of some of the best. I really loved the creativity of the owners in\ntrying to protect their mailboxes from being smashed.Q7:\nOn the cover you also have mansions. One of them looks like an old illustration\nof the White House.A7:\n(Smiles again)Q8:\nCan you tell us a little bit about the other stories in the anthology besides\n\"The Mailbox War\"?A8:In \"Azra'eil & Fudgie\" a little girl visits a team of marines\nin Afghanistan and they quickly learn she is more than she seems. \"The Mailbox\nWar\" is a deadly tale of a weekend hobby taken to extremes while \"The Brownie\nof the Alabaster Mansion\" sees a Scottish monster of antiquity brought back to\nlife. \"Memphistopheles\" contains a tale of the devil, Memphis, barbeque and a\nwannabe poet. \"The Serpent and the Sepulcher\" is a prose poem that will be\ncherished by all who experience it. \"The Gëbult Mansion\" recounts a literary\nhoax played by me on my unsuspecting social networking friends that involves a\nfemale vampire. Last, \"Stain\" is an unforgettable horror story that is uniquely\npresented.  Q9:\nIt sounds like you posted\"The Gëbult Mansion\" on Facebook and acted like it was really\nhappening.A9:\nI've noticed that a lot of people of social networking sites believe most\nanything that their friends post and I am just the type of author to take\nadvantage of it! For weeks I developed the background of the story. They, on\nthe chosen date, I supposedly flew to Michigan to survey an old mansion I had\ngotten on the cheap during the real estate meltdown. As I \"toured\" the mansion\nI posted photos I had taken with my cellphone a few days before. I got all the\nway through the house and up into the attic where I met my fate. My poor\nfriends got Prose Punked. It's all in the book.Q10:\nYour blog is AndrewBarger.blogspot.com.\nDid you post any of these dark tales to the site?A10:\nNone of these, but I have others written. You never know. Right now I am\ncounting down the Top 40 ghost stories from 1800-1849 on my blog. I'm posting\nfree links to them. The top ghost stories will be included inThe Best Ghost\nStories 1800-1849: A Classic Ghost Anthology.Q11:\nLast question. You have come up with a number of really interesting characters\nin these stories. Which one is your favorite?A11:\nFudgie is one of my favorites for sure. He makes me laugh and yet a part of me\nreally feels sorry for him. The brownie of the alabaster mansion is absurd and though\nhe tries hard to be likeable to those around him, I really despise the guy (in\na good way). I also enjoy the passive-aggressiveness of Theo Winterbottom and the\nineptitude of Milky in \"Stain.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Neurotically obsessed with death, which he simultaneously feared and welcomed, he channeled this obsession into a \"pattern of identification with female saints and martyrs.\" Wracked by guilt over his homosexual impulses, he repeatedly called himself a \"eunuch\" in his poems, and expressed his deepest religious emotions in sexual metaphors. Mentally unbalanced in his later years, he wrote sonnets and pagan hymns to physical beauty as a means to hold onto his sanity, according to Princeton emeritus professor Martin, the only biographer to gain unrestricted access to Hopkins's notebooks and jottings. This superlative, often astonishing portrait of Hopkins provides the fullest account to date of his agonized conversion from the Anglican faith to Roman Catholicism, and of the inner forces that drove him to create phenomenally observant poetry.

Yet the gift of holy spirit is the greatest gift God has given to mankind. Moses received it, and when he needed help administering the millions of Israelites, god took of the spirit that was upon Moses and gave it to the elders of Israel so they could rule with him. God gave His gift of holy spirit to the judges of Israel, such as Deborah and Samuel. He gave it to kings, such as David and Hezekiah, and to the prophets, such as Elijah, Isaiah, and Daniel. John the Baptist had holy spirit before he started his ministry. Now we can walk in the power of holy spirit. This book will answer such questions as:What is the difference between Holy Spirit and holy spirit?Why is \"holy spirit\" sometimes referred to as \"he\" and other times referred to as an \"it\"?What are the manifestations (sometimes called \"gifts\") of holy spirit?What is speaking in tongues, and why is it valuable for Christians?What is \"slain in the Spirit\"?This book shows that each Christian is sealed with God's gift of holy spirit the very moment that he is saved. Furthermore, it shows that each Christian can manifest, outwardly show, that spirit in the nine ways spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, including speaking in tongues. When we understand the gift of holy spirit and why God gave us such a wonderful gift, then we can take advantage of it in our lives. We can walk in the power of that same holy spirit and become more like Christ in attitude and action.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their remote fishing village has no roads, and the weekly supply plane brings them their only form of entertainment: three movies, ice cream, and popcorn. The latest movie stimulates Thumb's overactive imagination comes up with the notion that even small towns can have \"bad guys,\" and the two friends set out to spy on their neighbors. To their surprise, they unearth secrets and mysterious people. A new teacher, Ms. Weatherly, who wears a wig and tons of makeup, becomes an instant suspect in the puzzling events of the village. Fisherman Kirk McKenna arouses suspicion when he is seen sneaking around at night behind a waterfall where a hidden shed is found. When Ms. Weatherly helps the students solve the mystery of an 18th-century cannonball found on the beach, her students learn the real reasons behind her peculiar appearance. Thumb and Susan get the tables turned on them when the townspeople realize that they are the ones sneaking around and plan a surprise ambush. Franson's black-and-white graphic-style illustrations enhance the suspense. With its blend of creepiness, mystery, and humor, this story will be eagerly welcomed by fans of Thumb and Susan, but it stands alone.—Michele Shaw, Quail Run Elementary School, San Ramon, CAEND", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He occupies the fringes of the lives he delineates, which include families with roots in the 19th century and a mid-1980s Polish refugee eking it out in a world of drought and devastating fires. Excerpts from a local woman's laconic twenty pocket diaries, each smaller than a pack of cigarettes and taped conversations with chattier men lend balance to Tredinnick's alternating tones: metaphoric, meditative and occasionally textbookish. Evocative as Tredinnick's imagery often is, American readers would have been well served by some photographs of the dazzling waterfalls, the awesome crags and crevices, the unfamiliar plants and animals, even the devastating fires. Tredinnick's book requires patience; readers may find themselves in a temporal thicket as several pasts mingle with an elusive present (I'm going to tell some stories here... and what connects them is my living for a time among them on a piece of ground where they all meet). Absorbed slowly, as a pastoral landscape of loss and experiment in seeing and listening, the book richly rewards that patience.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Apart from a lot of political communist influence from the Soviet Union that shaped our lives, even as children, there was also a beautiful culture that we could experience as children and grown ups. Fairy tales had always been, and therefore still are for me, a very important aspect of my childhood. I didn't only grow up with the classic Grimm tales, but was allowed to enjoy a much larger range of the most beautiful enchanting fairy tales coming from the East, such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the various countries in the Soviet Union, and even from as far as Burma. My mother had, and still has, the biggest fairy tale book collection with beautiful graphics, and she, as well as my father, would read us the stories over and over again. When I was old enough to read myself, I devoured the books once more, and over the time I accumulated my own collection of fairy tale books.Having moved to Australia some years ago, and becoming a mother myself, I thought that I would like to pass on this part of my childhood and culture to my own child, and I began to wonder whether those fairy tales were also available in English. While there are indeed a lot of Russian fairy tales translated and retold in English, such as Old Man Winter--Morozko, The Firebird or fairy tales about Baba Jaga, there are still so many from various parts of the former Soviet Union, which are  now independent countries, that I did not come across in my research.I decided to create a compilation of my most beloved fairy tales from my childhood. As I worked on them, I noticed that there were actually so many, which I wanted to put into the book, and I couldn't decide which ones to choose first.This is the first volume of a series of ebooks, through which I would like to share those beautiful tales with you and your family. I'm sure that you'll enjoy them as much as I did.", "related": [], "rank": 2779819, "title": "Enchanting Fairy Tales from the East - The Second Hand Dream Vol 1 eBook", "author": "Marion Morningstar", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loved getting lost in a fantasy world even then. When her parents bought her a typewriter for Christmas at aged eleven, her fate was sealed. She spent hours dreaming up characters and creating stories. Not a lot has changed. Now when she is not writing you can find her enjoying a new release e-book. Lavinia has lived all over the UK but currently resides in London, England. She has travelled extensively to places including Africa, Asia, Australia, America and most of Europe. Although some of her books are set in Texas she has never visited the state but plans to spend time there in the near future. She is an avid reader and her favourite authors include J L Langley, Carol Lynne, Chris Owen and Andrew Grey. Lavinia particularly loves supernatural fiction and her favourite authors in this genre include Kelly Armstrong, Keri Arthur and Charlaine Harris. Although Lavinia is a huge fan of the romance genre, she will admit to reading anything and everything. She loves horror, a good thriller and if a book has the capacity to make her cry, well, all the better. One thing she does insist on in a book however, regardless of genre is a happy ending, so you will always find one in the books she writes.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was a drastic change, not to mention a drastic pay cut! I’ve been writing 25+ years and have been published in a variety of media. I love to write, it seems to be a passion I can’t ever seem to satisfy. I’m publishing  The Dragonslayers Saga. The first book, Project: Dragonslayers is an MWSA award winning novel about an unlikely Special Forces team who are thrown headlong into the world of counterterrorism. The second book, Dragonslayers: Mind Games continues the saga where the team enters the twisted world of al-Qaeda. They must find the source of a mystery explosive, or risk losing more innocent civilians to attacks. This book was selected for the MWSA summer 2011 reading list. Third book in the series: Dragonslayers: Battle Rhythm, has just been released. This time it’s Yemen, and the team finds out they’re not invincible. Also I've expanded my work in other genres. Out now is the best-selling contemporary romance, Cowboys and Olympians. You’ll meet and fall in love with Leo Richards, a champion reining horse trainer as he tries to convince himself that he can love again after his wife and unborn child were killed in a fiery car crash. He falls for Katie Shulman, a rich, stubborn woman who just doesn’t like cowboys. A supernatural thriller titled The Hall is complete and in editing stage. Projected release is 2012 sometime. You’ll meet Marcus Bishop, wealthy Memphis book publisher; his new and terrifically eccentric best friend, Prince Mongo; along with a ghost and demons that haunt the old castle Marcus buys. Also just released, the first book in a sci-fi trilogy: Space Crazy introduces you to Dar Meltom, a half breed alien who’s had a rough life. He longs for a life in the stars, and as difficult as it is, his mother manages to give that to him. Space Junk, the second book in the “Dar’s adventures in space” series is also completed. The final book in the series, Space Available, is in the works. As always, I appreciate feedback and book reviews. I'm a small fish in a huge ocean just trying to stay afloat. I love my writing and pour heart and soul into each work I do. Recently, I was given a rare distinction of placing 4th in Ron Knight's top 100 Facebook authors of 2011. He starts with 8,000 and narrows it down to 100. An honor indeed. http://www.authorronknight.com/2011/12/ron-knight%E2%80%99s-top-100-authors-on-facebook-50-1/", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 1688776, "title": "Space Junk (Dar's Adventures in Space Book 2) eBook", "author": "K.

Drawing skillful comparisons between the fictional family of Forsytes from John Galsworthy's epic work 'The Forsyte Saga,' and his own family history and youth in England, Longley invites us into a world far different from our own. Fictional narrative comes alive as we see true-life samples of the disparity between master and servant, strict cultural mores and rules, incidentals  like an organ-grinder, ginger-beer, and waning traditions like the garden parties and social clubs. Characters from Longley's own history stand out as colorful as any fictive Forsyte: taking on amusing an interesting lives of their own. Unveling the mystery and rigidity of social class in intimate and minute detail, where 'Forsythia' becomes a term referring to the attitudes, unwritten laws, and sometimes outright chutzpah of the haut monde, this precis on not only 'The Forsyte Saga' but Victorian and Edwardian periods heading into the transitional periods of wartime and upheaval, provides a meticulous, comprehensive history replete with copious detail and entertaining stories.

As public faith in the regime dissolved before its eyes, and the thousands in Tahrir Square grew increasingly unwilling to settle for anything short of Mubarak's complete relinquishing of power, the \"Last Pharaoh\" resigned himself to the mortgaging of his legacy and yet, unlike other regional leaders deposed or killed in the Arab Spring, refused to leave his country. For better or for worse, this chapter in Egypt's storied history is, to date, still being written.

This phenomenon of aging backward isn't unique to men, as Deborah Schoeneman, a writer for HBO's seriesGirls, points out. She looks at the \"woman-child\" through the lens of society, the economy, and her own circle of friends to create a fascinating portrait of grown women who love Hello Kitty, browse the Young Adult section in bookstores, and maintain more close relationships with other women than with men. Schoeneman--who's married and recently had a baby--is an outsider struggling to understand where the \"woman-child\" comes from. Does it stem from the fact that this generation is marrying later? Is it a result of the struggling economy, which forces many a newly minted adult to move back home with her parents? Or is it the desire to follow the lead of celebrities who dress (or are cast in roles) far younger than their age? Schoeneman's quest for understanding is filled with humor and compassion as she weaves her own story of coming of age with interviews of the \"women-children\" around her. The end result is a fascinating and timely picture of both the positive and negative aspects of the trend, which serves as a perfect entry point into the discussion.--Malissa Kent", "related": [], "rank": 1499111, "title": "Woman-Child (Kindle Single)", "author": "Deborah Schoeneman", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The \"letters\" are written primarily as a journal. They begin when Joseph is nine years old, and a plantation owner's son is \"teeching\" him how to \"rite.\" Although his life in his free great-grandmother's house is better than that of most slaves, he is always aware of his status. Escaping North Carolina, Joseph makes his way first to Boston and then to New Bedford, MA, where he boards a whaling ship. Later he travels to the gold fields of California. He is willing to do anything to earn freedom money for his family-even \"pass\" for white. However, Joseph's lack of financial acuity, his gambling, and, of course, his color make him easy prey, and he fails to save the needed funds. Despite this, he remains optimistic in his final letter as he sets sail for a better life in Australia. The \"letters\" are short and the pace is quick. The dialect and spelling give authenticity without making the text difficult to read and understand. Notes by the author explain that most events are fictionalized because little information is known about the real Joseph. Historical data supports the fiction. A reproduction of Joseph's protection paper issued in July 1846, photographs, and drawings from the time period are included. This title stands on its own, but children who appreciated the forthright perspective of the first book will want to read this one as well.—Carolyn Janssen, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OHCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If she could have a full sixty minutes to focus on the manuscript pages spread out in front of her, she might actually catch up on her work. Unfortunately, the thought of catching a nap was much more tempting than the book she was currently reading.Though she was officially on maternity leave from her job as an associate editor at Tandem Publishing, she had agreed to accept work on a contract basis to help out the senior editor and keep some money coming in. It had seemed like a good idea at the time, but Georgia hadn't been nearly as productive as she'd hoped to be, especially since she'd uprooted her kids and moved to Pinehurst only six weeks earlier.She sipped from the cup of herbal tea she'd reheated for a third time and skimmed through the previous chapter to refresh her memory. But just as her mind began to focus on the story, it occurred to her that it wastooquiet.The realization kicked her protective instincts into overdrive. She pushed her chair away from the table and raced across the hall to the living room, where she'd left four-year-old Quinn and Shane with a pile of building blocks. The carpet was littered with the chunky pieces but her boys were both gone—no doubt through the wide-open patio door.The door had been closed when she settled the boys down to play—closedandlocked. But the lock was tricky, and sometimes just tugging on the handle would allow the latch to slip and the lock to slide free. She'd talked to her mother about getting it fixed, but apparently that detail had slipped Charlotte's mind.And now her children were gone.She hurried back to the dining room to grab the baby monitor before racing out the back door.\"Quinn! Shane!\" She ran across the deck, cursing when she stepped on a red block. They couldn't have gone far. She'd only left them in the room a few minutes earlier. If anything had happened—No, she couldn't even complete the thought.\"Quinn! Shane!\"A flash of movement caught the corner of her eye, and she spun around, her heart sinking when she didn't see the boys' familiar faces but the shadowed jaw of a grown man standing on the grass.\"Are you looking for two little guys about yay—\" he held a hand about three and a half feet off the ground \"—high?\"\"Did you see where they went?\" she asked hopefully, desperately.\"They wandered into my backyard.\" He gestured toward the adjoining property.Georgia closed her eyes so he wouldn't see that they'd filled with tears. \"Oh, thank you, God.\"\"Actually, my name's Matt—Matt Garrett.\"She opened her eyes again and saw that he was smiling at her.\"And your kids are fine,\" he promised her.\"Only until I get my hands on them,\" she muttered.His smile widened.Now that the panic had subsided and her heart was beating more normally again, she took a moment to look at her new neighbor—and felt a little tug low in her belly.Matt Garrett had thick dark hair that was sexily tousled, as if he'd been running his fingers through it, a slightly crooked nose and a strong unshaven jaw. His shoulders were broad, his long, lean body well-muscled. And as his deep blue gaze connected with her own, she felt a subtle buzz in her veins that made her feel hot and tingly in a way that she hadn't experienced in a very long time.\"One of the puppies escaped into your yard and caught their attention,\" he explained.\"Puppies?\"\"Come and check them out,\" he invited.She hooked the monitor on her belt and followed him, surreptitiously checking out his spectacular backside as she did so.He'd moved in a few days earlier. She'd noticed the moving truck when she'd gone out to the porch to check the mail Wednesday afternoon—and then she'd noticed the tall, broad-shouldered man supervising the unloading of it.He was in faded denim with an even more faded Orioles T-shirt stretched across his broad chest. Definitely a man's man, she decided, and felt a flutter of something low in her belly. He lifted an arm in casual greeting and flashed a quick smile that actually made Georgia's heart skip a beat before it began hammering against her ribs.She raised her hand in response, waving her mail at him, then felt the flood of heat in her cheeks as she realized what she'd done. She wasn't sure if it was sexual deprivation or sleep deprivation that was responsible for her distraction, but thankfully, he was too far away to note either her instinctive physical response or her embarrassment. But wow—the man obviously had some potent sex appeal if he could affect her from such a distance.An appeal that, she knew now, was further magnified up close.\"This is Luke—and Jack,\" Matt told her, gesturing to the two other men on his porch in turn. \"My brothers.\"The former was even taller than her six-foot-tall neighbor, with the same brown hair but blue-green eyes; the latter was of similar height but with broader shoulders and slightly darker hair. All three were sinfully handsome.\"I'm Georgia,\" she finally said, her heart rate mostly back to normal now that the twins were in her line of sight again. \"And these pint-sized Houdinis are Quinn and Shane.\"\"What's a Houdini?\" Quinn tore his attention away from the blanket-lined laundry basket for the first time since she'd stepped onto her neighbor's porch.\"A little boy who is in very serious trouble for leaving the house without his mommy,\" she admonished.Her son's gaze dropped to his feet, a telltale sign of guilt. \"We just wanted to see the puppies.\"\"Puppies,\" Shane echoed, and looked up at her with the heartbreakingly sweet smile that never failed to remind her of his father.She took a few steps closer, as inexorably drawn to the basket as her children had been. But still, she had to make sure they understood that leaving the house for any reason wasn't acceptable.\"If you wanted to see the puppies, you should have told Mommy that you wanted to see the puppies,\" she said.\"But you told us not to bug you 'cuz you had work to do,\" Quinn reminded her.And it was exactly what she'd said when she set them up with their blocks.\"I also told you to never go anywhere—even outside into the backyard—without telling me first.\"But how could she blame them for being drawn away when even her heart had sighed at the first glimpse of those white, brown and black bodies wriggling around in the basket?She looked at her neighbor again. \"You havefourpuppies?\"\"No.\" Matt shook his head emphatically. \"/ don't haveanypuppies—they're all Luke's.\"\"Only until I can find good homes for them,\" his brother said.\"How did you end up with them?\" she wondered.\"I'm a vet,\" he told her. \"And when someone finds an abandoned animal on the side of the road, it usually ends up at my clinic. In this case, the abandoned animal was a very pregnant beagle that, two days later, gave birth to eight puppies.\"\"Eight?\" She cringed at the thought. As if carrying and birthing twins hadn't been difficult enough.\"My receptionist is taking care of the other four.\"\"They look kind of young to be away from their mother,\" she noted.\"They are,\" he agreed.It was all he said, but it was enough for her to understand that the mother hadn't survived the delivery—and to be grateful that his response in front of the twins wasn't any more explicit than that.\"Nice puppy,\" Shane said, gently patting the top of a tiny head.\"Can we keep one?\" Quinn, always the more talkative and articulate twin, asked her.She shook her head. As much as she hated to refuse her kids anything, she'd learned that there were times she had to say no. This was definitely one of those times. \"I'm sorry, boys. A puppy is too much responsibility for us to take on right now.\"But she didn't object when Matt lifted one of them out of the box and handed it to her. And she couldn't resist bringing it closer to nuzzle the soft, warm body. And when the little pink tongue swiped her chin, her heart absolutely melted.\"He likes you, Mom,\" Quinn told her.\"She,\" Matt corrected. \"That one's a girl.\"Her son wrinkled his nose. \"We don't want a girl puppy.\"\"We don't wantanypuppy,\" Georgia said again, trying to sound firm.\"Wedowant a puppy,\" Shane insisted.\"'Cept Dr. Luke says they can't go anywhere for two more weeks,\" Quinn informed her. \"'Cuz they're too little to eat and hafta be fed by a bottle.\"Shane pouted for another minute, but the mention of eating prompted him to announce, \"I'm hungry.\"\"So why don't we go home and I'll make some little pizzas for lunch?\" she suggested.\"With pepperonis?\"\"With lots of pepperoni,\" she promised.But Quinn shook his head. \"We don't wanna go home. We wanna stay with the daddies.\"Georgia felt her cheeks burning as her gaze shifted from one man to the next.Matt's smile slipped, just a little; Luke kept his attention firmly focused on the animals; and Jack actually took a step backward.\"They're at that age,\" she felt compelled to explain, \"where they think every adult male is a daddy. Especially since they lost their own father.\"\"He's not lost, he's dead,\" Quinn said matter-of-factly.The announcement made Shane's eyes fill with tears and his lower lip quiver. \"I miss Daddy.\"Georgia slipped her arm around his shoulders...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}

He is someone who cares about the people around him, who wants to improve the society we all live in, who hopes on a daily basis to leave the planet a little better than it was the previous day and who is cognizant that the impact he has on the world is minimal. Tilting at windmills is a major part of his character as is a deep love for all those who need to be loved. In his own mind he is a complex, multi-layered, unique character in the kaleidoscoping drama of life. Most of my writing deals with social issues that I feel need addressed.   My feelings are generally worn boldly on my sleeves and that is how I address social issues.   Parents that travel or are deployed, domestic abuse, feelings of alienation, bullies, blindness, stepmothers, the demise of pets are all things that I have addressed or plan on addressing in my books.    My target market is children.   This is most likely due to my personal unwillingness to accept all aspects of maturity.    What kids feel and understand is often grossly underestimated.   I have hopes of providing kids with some help in dealing with social issues that many of them face.    Most of all I hope to write things that kids will want to read.   As our society becomes more and more technical there is one old skill that is increasing in demand, the ability to read and to comprehend what you read.   The ability to read a book certainly provides you with the ability to read a technical manual or to read the text on a LCD screen whether it is on your computer or your cellular phone.   Reading for enjoyment not only broadens the mind, it can decrease stress and make life more enjoyable.   Success is measured in many ways.   I felt successful in my working life whether it was slinging baloney, teaching or fixing computers.   When I had a 7 year old approach me and tell me she loved my book I truly felt I was an author.  My goal as an author isn’t selling a lot of books.  My goal is to touch children’s lives and help them live life a little better.    Education: B.S.

He laments that we have lost the true meaning of education in the service of personal enlightenment and broader social good. As long as we hold these anti-education viewpoints, the use of technology in classrooms will follow the old paradigms of education rather than a more expansive view needed to develop twenty-first-century innovation and critical thinking, argues Gee, education innovator and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy (2007). He begins by examining the dumber impulses we’ve exhibited in recent years, from political polarization to the destruction of financial systems and the environment, then looks at what we can do, going forward, to correct missteps and make ourselves smarter and better able to contribute to finding solutions to the crucial issues of our times. Gee advocates for using the tools of technology and what he calls synchronized intelligence to rethink education, careers, and broader issues of social justice. --Vanessa Bush", "related": ["B00ANSPUPO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tension rose but it wasn't unpleasant--instead the air, strangely, seemed\ntosizzle. Her heart fluttered as she was locked in his blue eyes, held\nimmobile by a sudden yearning for him. James was tall and broad, with brown hair\ncut short, looking silky to the touch, and a hint of stubble along his strong\njaw. He stood casually but it did nothing to diminish his stature, his\nstrength.They'd parted on bad terms, but no one would guess just looking at\nhim--he seemed like no time had passed. No one would guess the hurt that hollowed\nher out and left her broken.Marie looked away from the heat in his eyes and the moment between\nthem ended. Instead she moved for the front door. Some fresh air would do her\ngood--it might cool her suddenly flushed skin. She let the camera hang from her\nshoulder again and reached for the door.It didn't budge.She frowned and checked the lock. It was fine. Again she twisted at\nthe knob but to no avail--it was stuck, completely\nshut.\"Well.\" James sighed behind her. \"Guess you're stuck with\nme.\"Her temper flared. \"Did you do this?\" She turned back to him and\npointed at the door. \"Seriously?\"His eyes widened but she didn't believe him for a second. \"Such an\naccusation.\" But her unyielding anger seemed to dawn on him at last and he\nsobered. \"It's not me.\" James walked past her, reached for the door, and tried\nthe knob only to have the same result she did.Forget this--I'm finding another door.Marie shook her head and trekked away from him, down the opposite\nhall. The floor creaked angrily, announcing her every movement, and she didn't\ncare. She stalked past the stairs, the lantern swinging in her hand, and down\nthe corridor. She passed two closed doors and two archways leading to dark rooms\nshe didn't spare a glance to. At the back of the house she found another door\nand she stomped right up to it and grasped the\nhandle.This one didn't open either.Damn it!She pounded with her free hand against the wood and it just kicked\nmore dust up that filled her lungs and tickled her nose. She coughed and stepped\nback, glaring at the door as if that might open it. Her head throbbed and pain\nstretched over the back of her neck. The fear creeping up in her was\novershadowed by exhaustion and she slumped against the wall by the door with a\nsigh.Steps crossed the floor and while she continued staring at the barred\nexit, she spoke to James. \"You're telling me that's not you? Keeping it shut?\nAfter all your ghost talk?\" When silence followed, she turned her tired eyes to\nhim.He cast a glance back at her. \"No, it's not\nme.\"\"Then who's doing it?\"His lips parted.\"Don't say ghosts!\"\"Okay. Spirits?\"I have to get out of here.Once again she pushed past him, still needing to clear her head.\nThis time she turned into the kitchen and set the lantern down, and stopped to\nlook outside. The windows showed a dark, overgrown lawn patterned with dry\nfallen leaves, and pricks of stars in the sky. She leaned on the counter,\npeering up at the starlight.Damn him. He had to be keeping those doors shutsomehow.Marie slipped the camera off her shoulder, set it on the counter, and\nher gaze trailed over the sink. Her throat was parched and her skin was flushed\nstill, whether from her quick temper or something else, she didn't know. Though\nshe doubted she'd have success, she reached over and fiddled with the dusty taps\nanyway.Nothing. Nothing at all. Whether it was attached to a well with a\nbroken pump or the town line and it hadn't been turned on with the house being\nvacant, she didn't know. And it didn't matter. No water, damn\nit.James' footfalls sounded on the floor. She sighed and turned around,\npressed her back against the counter, and watched his approach. His hands were\nknotted behind his back and he came nearer, nearer, until her head tilted back\nso she could continue to meet his gaze. Scarce inches separated them and for\nsome reason her mind went wild wanting--Stop. It. And get a hold of yourself. But that was easier said than done. She locked her hands onto the\ncounter's edge and waited.\"Thirsty?\" he asked.\"Taps don't work and I didn't bring anything. Wasn'tplanningon staying, but that was before someone locked me\nin.\"\"I didn't--\"But she didn't want to hear it. She started to turn away from him\nwhen his arm darted out, barring her path along with the bottle he had in\nhand.James said nothing but held still, offering the bottle. At last she\nrelented and took it, turned it back and forth in her hands. The label was too\nfaded to read.\"You didn't pack wine,\" she said.\"Maybe I did. Or maybe...\" He seemed to be leaning closer to her\nstill and her heart leapt, the warmth of him enveloping her, his voice dropping\nlow against her ear. \"I...stole it from the billiard\nroom.\"Marie grinned. He was exceptionally good at melting away her\nirritation though she was loath to admit it. \"I don't really want to know what\nfood you might've found in there too.\"\"Nothing in therebutI have sandwiches. They were in my\nbag.\"Back in the billiard room. She clutched the wine bottle to her chest.\n\"How about eating in a different room?\"\"Drawing room?\"She made a face. \"Library?\"His expression sobered and he averted his gaze. \"Oh. Yeah, I think I\npassed it on my way.\" He took her lantern and started from the\nkitchen.Marie watched his retreat for a moment, hugging the old, sealed\nbottle of wine. Her head continued to ache but maybe some food would make her\nfeel better. Still, locked in here...The twisting in her stomach told her this night wasn't going to end\nwell.", "related": ["B00KYCRMUU"], "rank": 2020838, "title": "Somebody to Love: A Ghost Story", "author": "Asha King", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Enough mystery and fantasy to engage readers of all ages; in part, inspired by a Cherokee legend. I loved the animal characters. Although the story starts in the 1950's, it quickly moves to present day and references contemporary things (like curly fries) that kids will relate to. There is a lot of information about nature, animals and even hydrology subtly woven into the story without making it feel academic. The Beyond the Pond FB page has photos of the characters the story was based on. A great book for Home-Schools, where it could be incorporated into several subject lessons. A great Christmas gift; it's on my list. --M. Watanabe \"Booklady/AmazonI really enjoyed this book. The characters are unique and keep you drawn in. The story is well laid out and moves quickly. You don't want to put it down. I will continue to watch for more of her writings. Only occasionally does a story come out that makes me take notice enough to keep and eye on the author. MaryAnn --MaryAnn/GoodreadsOlivia and Charlie set out on a mission to save Thalia, which isn't a simple task for two little fish! There's adventure, danger and suspense. This is a great book for children and young adults that incorporates imagination with the creation story, and shows how sin has affected and still affects nature as well as individuals. This is a wonderful story that combines the gospel story with imagination. It certainly draws you in, making you wonder what will happen next, and if good will overcome evil. I look forward to the second book! --Abbie Loan/Goodreads", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

At age thirteen, living in Los Angeles, she began life drawing four to eight hours a week under the tutelage of two commercial artists. After high school she attended Long Beach State, almost flunked out, but returned several years later  where, on one and the same day, her art instructor highly suggested she stick to writing and her writing teacher said she’d better focus on art. ‘But,’ Nancy wondered ‘what would happen if I didn’t quit?’ She moved to Portland, Oregon where she graduated from Lewis and Clark College and where she lives today but most importantly where her scribbles in Crayola Crayons are pulchritudinous pieces of sublime energy and her stories, created to be read out loud, are crafted in words that rattle teeth, caress tongues and feel good in the mouth. The tales themselves create new thoughts and possibilities  while the story lines reveal added depth at every reading. For the listener, Nancy stimulates the, “why did they do that?” thoughts, a love of words, an introduction to new and Nan-created words and a world where children are cherished members of a family of unique grown-ups and downs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The girls have also made a pact to ask their crushes to the dance, and Zoey has to work up the courage to do it. Right after she settles on a design for her own dress, Zoey gets a once-in-a-lifetime invitation to be a guest judge on an episode of her favorite fashion reality show. Although excited about the opportunity, she is disappointed when she realizes filming is on the same day as the dance, and it is unlikely she will make it back in time. Once again, the opportunities Zoey gets are a bit fanciful, but her upbeat personality and determination to be herself and pursue her dreams—with the support of friends and family—is refreshing.

My workshops and retreats are based on this book.  According to those who have participated in my workshops and retreats, this is  transformational work and it changes people’s lives.   I teach from real life experience, using the same principles that transformed my past pain and struggle into a life of inspiration, purpose, and success. I began studying and integrating the great spiritual teachings as well and became a Wilderness Guide, leading Vision Quests.  I have put together my accumulated wisdom and I am inspired to share and guide you in releasing the old and limiting beliefs and embracing who you REALLY are. My message screams to awaken you to knowing that you create the life you have and you have the power to choose from infinite possibility. I love to create sacred space, hang out in nature as well as at the Coffee Bean. I love to dance around a fire as well as dipping on a dance floor!  I married a fabulous man a few years ago on a beach in Santa Barbara and our first dance was to Louis Armstong's \"Wonderful World\".  I believe we live in a wonderful world and life is to be lived and savored in each moment that is now, no matter how big or how small. Maria's Purpose: \"The purpose of my life is to shimmer and to radiate love to those around me through my dance of life\" Maria lives her purpose by: *Living BIG and releasing small thoughts and ideas.  This inspires and empowers people to awaken to their own creative power and Divine presence and an inner knowing of their own greatness. *Living without regret - jumping into any situation with love and abandon!   Her example helps to guide people to transcend fear, limiting beliefs, distorted perceptions of their body and self worth. *Living with kindness.  Not just with those around her, but with herself as well.  Living with kindness is living with love.", "related": ["B00AAUAH7G"], "rank": 1764360, "title": "Love Your Body Now!

He began his pastoral ministry at the age of 19 by leading a Bible study of 30 people. Since then, God has transformed that small group into a church of some 15,000 people. Today, Harvest is one of the largest churches in America, and consistently ranks among the most influential churches in the country. In 1990, Laurie began holding large-scale public evangelistic events called Harvest Crusades. Since that time, more than 4,405,000 people have attended Harvest Crusades events around the United States, ranging from the annual event at Angel Stadium in Anaheim to Madison Square Garden in New York City. Greg spoke to 50,000 people at a 2011 Harvest Crusade in Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium. Harvest Crusades have also been held internationally in Australia and New Zealand. More importantly, more than 370,900 people have registered professions of faith through these outreaches. Laurie is the featured speaker of the nationally-syndicated radio program, A New Beginning, which is broadcast on more than 500 radio outlets around the world. A New Beginning is also one of the most popular Christian podcast downloads on Apple's iTunes Store. Laurie has a weekly television program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and he has appeared on many other television news programs. Along with his work at Harvest Ministries, Laurie serves on the board of directors of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He holds honorary doctorates from Biola University and Azusa Pacific University. In addition to speaking and assisting other ministries, Laurie has authored over 70 books including Signs of the Times, Start To Follow, Hope for Hurting Hearts, Married.Happily., Essentials, What Every Christian Needs to Know, Upside Down Living, The Greatest Stories Ever Told, and many more. Laurie has written study notes for the bestselling The New Believer's Bible and The Seeker's Bible. He also wrote the notes for the recently released Start! Bible in the New King James Version. Greg is presently working on a new Bible project for Thomas Nelson called Refresh, which is a devotional Bible. Greg has been married to Cathe Laurie for 38 years and he has two sons, Christopher and Jonathan. Christopher went to be with the Lord in 2008. Greg and Cathe also have five grandchildren.", "related": ["B00BXW6L48"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have been buying storage units for years. I pick up all sorts of things, but I love redoing furniture the most. I re-purpose items and then sell them at a huge profit. Ever since shows like Storage Wars, Flea Market Flips and Auction Hunters have come into homes everywhere, people are starting to see just how much money can be made with little to no investment. The word \"Picking\" is finally becoming in fashion and mainstream. I have furnished my entire home, and many of my friends's homes, from craigslist ads, swap meets, storage units, flea market finds, and trash bins. Because people were constantly asking me how I was able to work from home, stay so relaxed, spend all kinds of quality time with my family and have money in my wallet overflowing, I decided to share my secrets in a book I call \"Trash Picking For Profit\". I don't have a design degree and I'm no artist. But I can see something ugly or useless and envision it in a different light. That \"gift\" is what I teach others to recognize in the books I write. And did I mention I'm a writer? I've been writing and publishing books for the last 11 years (in paperback in retail stores, and for the last 7 years on this fabulous Amazon Kindle marketplace.) I've written for myself as well as others who pay me to ghostwrite. I don't tell you this to brag. I'm a professional. I'm a professional Picker, and a Professional Writer. Those two careers have meshed together to create the books in this series. I tell you this because I want you to know that you will be getting a quality formatted, superbly written, and grammatically correct book that you'll appreciate. And The Recycling for Profit series comes complete with step by step instructions and pictures. Plus I show you how to market your items to buyers and find the ones who will pay top dollar for your unique, never before seen items. I literally hold your hand throughout the entire process. And, my information is current. Trash Picking for Profit is a real treasure, because you can learn how to score items without ever paying for them. Wouldn't you like to have a garage full of items just sitting there about to make you money off of Craigslist, Ebay or your very own yard sale? If you're looking for a way to make extra money, have fun, & change your financial status- this is the book for you.", "related": ["B00IB24OMO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has been followed by Blood Diamonds Conspiracy; Driven By Lust; Baring Her Soul and From Serbia with Love. I refuse to be constrained by genres as you will see. See details on my website above. Readers have commented that my writing is controversial, compelling, descriptive and evocative, and they become involved with the characters. What more could a writer ask for? I am unable to restrain myself from becoming emotionally involved in humanitarian issues, as well as with my clients, readers and it comes through in my stories. I currently live in my hometown in Auckland, New Zealand and love to travel to other countries and have been to Europe many times, as my very talented partner Harald,who designs my covers,is from Germany. This has given me the opportunity to fall in love with historical landscapes and their cultures, and also indulge in three of my passions, good food, wine and great conversation. I have gleaned many ideas and settings for my stories by traveling to well known cities in Europe, and also through the small villages, each with their own special story, which have enabled me to create believable and sympathetic characters. Currently I teach English to Muslim immigrants from Iraq.

Having visited Guthrie many times, I had been unaware of this fact. I suppose it was overshadowed by Guthrie's other colorful historical facts -- the main one being the Land Runs. I hope to set a series of historical romances in Guthrie directly after the Land Runs. TO SEDUCE AND DEFEND is the first one and is the story of a woman who travels to Guthrie to claim land that her deceased husband purchased, unbeknownst to her. However, when she arrives, she discovers that nothing is as it appears to be and she is caught in a web of deceit. A handsome attorney swears to defend her property claims even as he gently, persuasively seduces her.

He worked for twenty years for the most popular daily of Naples, Il Mattino, writing articles on science, medicine, informatics, literature and astrology. He has always refused to cast the so-called ‘horoscopes of the solar signs’ for that newspaper, as well as for any other newspaper or magazine. He worked for five years at the CNR (National Research Council) and, for two years in the Istituto Motori of Naples, CNR. He has been dealing with astrology since 1970. He has written over 70 books, most of them best-sellers in Italy as well as abroad and he has published over 1,000 astrological lessons on YouTube and about 300 short Astrology Essays on Google Books. In 1990 he founded the quarterly Ricerca ‘90, which he has been editing and publishing since then. He has been doing statistical researches from the very beginning of his interest in astrology. During the early ‘90s, he obtained brilliant results with researches on astral heredity on a sample of over 75,000 subjects. The astrological rules #1 and #2, published in his Transits and Solar Returns have been statistically demonstrated by Didier Castille – the greatest astrological statistic researcher in the world – on the entire French population, and this is probably the most convincing evidence in Astrology of the possibility to statistically demonstrate some astrological items. These rules were also demonstrated in over 40 years of studies by some researchers of Zurich University and they are the only statements of an astrologer, of every time, demonstrated by Official Science. He has been holding seminars, courses and lectures in different universities and cultural centres in Italy and abroad. He particularly deals with Predictive Astrology, Aimed Solar Returns and Aimed Lunar Returns. According to many colleagues, he may be considered the greatest living expert of this area of study. Not only has he written many texts on this specific segment of the art of Urania – he can also rely on the experience of more than 25,000 aimed birthdays (covering the years 1970 to 2012). He is deeply interested in informatics. Astrologically speaking, he followed the school of André Barbault. He founded the school of the Active Astrology.", "related": [], "rank": 1709393, "title": "The 20 Days Before and After the Birthday", "author": "Ciro Discepolo", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I first got married when I was 20 years old and had my first child when I was 17. I had my second child when I was 23 years old. I began writing stories when the children were very young. I was inspired by my kids and also by my English teacher back in high school, where I had to write a short story and he had told me that I have talent in writing and I should write a child's book. So with that I began writing. Many stories have hit the trash and finally I had written a few which then sat on a shelf with my thought of someday publishing my stories, and life just got in the way and after 24 years of marriage and the children growing older, there was still no book. At the end of my 24 years of marriage back in 2009, my husband had passed away from Colon Cancer a tragedy in our lives. I was then a single mom for a couple of years before I met my new husband in 2011; we then had gotten married in 2012. One evening I was just fooling around with the computer and looking up on the internet \"How to publish a book\" and my husband said to me \"you really should publish your book\". So I looked more into this and here I am today. The story I chose for my book is actually a fond memory of when my children were small. They inspired me for this one. This is basically as I remembered this happening I may have changed it a bit but not by much. I have found that many children have the same fear as in my story and my hope is that this story will help them overcome this fear as well. I am now a proud grandmother of four grandchildren of my own and then an additional two from my new marriage, so being a grandmother of six now I hope to pass my stories onto all of my grandchildren and future ones as well. I hope that you enjoy my story and share with your children and grandchildren as well. I look forward to publishing more in the future.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After leaving school at 16 Glyn worked as an investigative auditor for local councils and developed a taste for undertaking probing enquiries. He took these skills into the Police Service in 1985 serving in four Midlands Police Services over his career, spending many of those years in Criminal Investigation, eventually leading homicide and kidnap investigations as well as other serious and major crime.  Glyn has always maintained an interest in writing since his early scribblings at school, where he wrote plays, books and comics, however, a busy career and the general business of life pushed his literary ambitions to one side - at least for a while. Now retired from the police Glyn writes full time, relishing the chance to tell and share the stories he bases on his years of experience of dealing with people from all walks of life, and from a wide range of his diverse experiences. In his police career Glyn became a trained and experienced Senior Investigating Officer for homicide and kidnap and a hostage negotiator, as well as working in a range of other capacities including roads policing, firearms and public order.  Glyn found the energy to study for two University degrees in his spare time, and to learn to play the drums. He loves music and has idolised The Beatles since he was old enough to put a needle to vinyl. He follows his hometown football club, West Bromwich Albion, though he left the town on his travels many years ago. Glyn likes to keep fit and enjoys some sports as a participant, particularly football and racquet sports, though middle-age and opportunity are limiting factors these days. Glyn has two grown up daughters and currently lives in the Heart of England where he happily taps away at his computer keyboard entertaining himself and hopefully the people who are kind enough to read his books.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spent most of my childhood in a seaside resort town on the south coast of my native England. Eastbourne was a wonderful place to grow up, but sheltered just enough to make me want to go out and spread my wings and see what the rest of the world had to offer! That adventure started after I married a wonderful, young serviceman. After settling into life in the forces, we moved to Germany where we lived for a couple of years. On returning to England and civilian life, we settled in the north where I found work in the more heavily industrialized world of Yorkshire. Very different from the life I had known in a seaside resort! I loved living in and learning about the lifestyles in different parts of England, but my education really expanded when we moved half the world away to Saudi Arabia. The contrast between the coastal mountain areas and the inland, desert cities along with the rich culture and traditions going back literally thousands of years, is something which has affected my life and my writing ever since. Eventually we bid ‘Adieu’ to those exotic, arid lands and returned to the UK. Back home again, I started my own business—a secretarial agency which provided companies with the then-fledgling service of a virtual assistant. We’ve now moved again and this time to Wales, where I’ve settled into my writing career, and very happily draw on my many experiences both at home and abroad. Because those experiences have been so diverse, my books tend to be very different from each other and stand on their own- in plot, characters, culture and background.", "related": [], "rank": 4599890, "title": "Evergreen Woman (Evergreen Series Book 2)", "author": "Sybil Powell", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Talk about worlds colliding; being the only official Yankee in a house full of rebels made life interesting to say the least. Maybe that’s why she has always liked action movies and suspense.  Being a morning person allows her to get all her writing and other work done which leaves her time in the evenings for her favorite shows. Any given evening you can find her watching shows like NCIS, NCIS Los Angeles, Criminal Minds, Burn Notice, CSI, Elementary, Person of Interest and numerous others. Her interests don’t stop at regular suspense but extend to the great beyond. One of her favorite series was Stargate SG-1. She’s still waiting for a trip through the shimmering worm-hole ring. Warehouse 13 has also caught her interest and has sparked ideas for several stories. With all of these shows filled with quite a bit of violence you may wonder at her calling herself a romance writer. Never fear, while she enjoys the intricacies of figuring out the how, who, and why of crimes her real love is for the relationships that bind the players together. The bonds between partners on the force and off the force. The dance between people at work, at play, and in their everyday settings.

There is something so quietly thought-provoking about the cover that really sets the mood and tone of the piece. It's like you just look at it and get a breath of fresh air and settle down for a meaningful and thoughtful adventure. I loved it! I really enjoyed how many of the poems seem to be about taking the bitterness that life brings at times and turning them into inspiring moments. At least, that is what I kept noticing, and as they say, \"Poetry is beautiful because you read a new poem each time you read it.\" It was nice to have full page poems for a change. I'm used to collections of poetry with mini three-lined poems crammed five to a page. It's nice to find some poems as long as four or five pages. They give you more of a sense of what the poet is speaking about and a bigger picture. In addition, because it takes you longer to read, you spend more time focusing on what the poet is trying to say instead of just burning through poem after poem. I absolutely loved \"Holding Back.\" It just resonated with me and I responded to that connection. It brought to mind exactly how I feel and what I am experiencing in one of my longest relationships. I really love how not only that poem, but most of them, really get to the heart, the emotion of a situation and define it in words that you didn't even know you were thinking about. Call me old fashioned, but I like my poems to rhyme.

Hood to watch fire fill the heavens in celebration of America’s independence, my mother was in labor attempting to catch a glimpse of the spectacle through a hospital window.  Born at dawn, she named me after my forefathers and blessed me, in distinction, with the middle name of David after the biblical king.  Far from royalty, my childhood and adolescence sparked my life of a journeyman due to divorce.  I could not allow myself to become attached to materialistic things, such as toys, because at any moment it could be left behind during one of our many moves throughout the United States. Settling in the northeast, I found myself nestling more and more into my imagination to cope with the multiple environments and the harsh conditions.  I quickly made friends and involved them in my fun by acting out scenes from our favorite cartoon series or dramatizing a memorable sporting event with each swing at bat.  I found my passion for storytelling.  Closing on my 14th birthday, my mother passed away taking with her my desires to continue creating these scenarios in my head, instilling the need to deal with the adult-like realities of what I felt was becoming a man. During my teenage years, I resented all art until I found myself alone, confused, and without a home.  I sought out refuge in my notebook and pen with the influence of music.  I found myself venting with each line I wrote as my schoolwork began to reflect the same craft.  As misfortunes came routinely, so did my acknowledgment begin to fade of the contentment I received while free writing. Graduating from high school, I attempted to pursue higher learning but was unable to afford it and was convinced that the military would grant me the opportunity to continue.  A four year commitment became eleven years “time in service.”  Again I suppressed my writing, a journeymen once more.  The best moments to scribe and I decided just to be, to capture every moment in my life.  I have to admit, there were times I took note to acclimate myself better to my surroundings and understand more of a particular set of values strengthened by camaraderie.   Separated now from the ranks, I decided to return to my studies to sharpen my knowledge and my resourcefulness.  For I am readdressing a dream I once had to remain a professional at what I do, once upon a time in a land not too far away.", "related": [], "rank": 4191151, "title": "Ekawa I eBook", "author": "Martin Munoz", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I grew out of the mud play, well, most of the time, a good soak in the mud is always fun. I still daydream often and sometimes my daydreams interrupt my daydreams. So I write to remember them. If I didn't write, I think my mind would explode from an overload of fantasy and weirdness. To the annoyance of my friends and family, my characters sometimes become a part of my world. During my childhood, I would frequently get in trouble in school for daydreaming. Eventually, my vivid imagination paid off and I had the privilege of writing and co-directing my sixth-grade class play--a dreadful disaster, though not from my writing, of course. I'm pretty sure it was the acting. I enjoy writing about characters living in small quaint towns and tend to lean toward the unusual and edgy. My paranormal playing field delves into a different milieu, abandoning vampires and werewolves, but not discounting them. Someday I might like to write a novel about vamps and those furry creatures. But for now I like the bizarre mixed with romance. A strong hero or heroine confronted with extraordinary forces of nature, powers and capabilities gets my blood running hot as does an steamy contemporary romantic suspense.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.8667, "rating_total": 73.0}

His writings aren't typical, with the writing style harking back to the early twentieth Century, and the stories being complex and meandering. Without action heroes, antiheroes or even clear conflicts, the stories are more character based, as the central characters try to figure out where they are and where they're going. The reader gets sucked along, as they try to piece together where they fit in the world. His work consists of two series, \"The Catalyst\" (6 books in total), and \"The Great Death (2 books thus far).

Carol was born in Connecticut as the youngest sibling in a family of four sisters and six brothers (including her twin brother). She was raised by loving parents in a household where food and family intertwined. When she became a mother, she continued the shared-meal ritual as a way to foster development of her own daughter and son. When Carol planned the research for her graduate thesis, she landed on her own family as the perfect source for a multigenerational study. This effort revealed a deeper understanding of how the shared-meal ritual impacts family members from early childhood through late adulthood. The Shared-Meal Revolution is the result of both research and inspiration. After receiving her MA in human development in 2007 from Pacific Oaks College (California), Carol became motivated to continue her work on shared meals to promote a universal understanding of how a shared-meal ritual can enhance the lives of individuals, families, communities . . . and American society. Currently residing in Los Angeles, California, Carol shares ideas and stories about creating rich meal and lifestyle experiences in her blog Shared Meals Matter on her website www.shared-meals.com, as well as through articles in online and print media. Carol enjoys dual citizenship in Italy and is working on her next book, which explores shared-meal practices in other countries.

Youcanhave both!If your marriage is suffering because you're too busy with the kids, you're not alone.  Many modern couples fall into the same trap. By sacrificing their relationships with their partners to focus on their children, they believe they're being perfect parents. But in fact, they're doing their children more harm than good and they're ruining their marriages in the process. The outcome is demanding, insecure children with unrealistic expectations of the world—and resentful, alienated spouses who feel taken for granted. The good news is that it doesn't need to be this way. Youcanhave it all: a thriving marriage, an enriching family life, and independent, well-adjusted children.Renowned marriage therapist and author Andrew G. Marshall shows you how to revive and nurture your marriage while raising an emotionally healthy family. For over 30 years, he has been helping couples save their relationships by refocusing their priorities and putting their partners first.

Marshall's strategies may seem unconventional but they are rooted in decades of marriage counseling experience.Packed with tips, advice, and compelling examples, this witty and insightful guide equips you with the tools you need to turn your marriage around. You'll learn how to: Ask for the support you need Overcome differences in parenting styles and find acceptable compromises Share household responsibilities effectivelyDefine what your children truly need from youWork together as a team Rekindle your passion for each other and keep it aliveAvoid the pitfalls of raising 'red carpet kids' and give your children a strong foundation for adulthoodIf parenthood has taken center stage and pushed your marriage to the background, this book will help you restore the balance.

Marshall show you how to reclaim your relationship while raising emotionally healthy children.", "related": ["B00AMUITLK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her parents, running the vast Art Deco Odeon Cinema complex and the publicity machine that ensued, allowed for many sexual fantasies to become realities by the time Janis was expelled from her Grammar School, Tonbridge, when she was sixteen. She then 'graduated' to the left wing theatre Unity and onto France through louche circles she met there. Having become the 'plaything' of a Parisian brothel keeper, Janis fled back (after a party trick went disastrously wrong) to a drab but emerging England of the still early sixties, intent on pursuing a career in the sex trade. The timing could not have been more perfect. In the mid sixties, having set up an establishment with the notorious Madam Jane Jones, Janis was plunged into a series of scandalous court cases that were never proven despite direct police evidence. One of the many firsts in Janis's life. Her sexually themed parties in the sixties and seventies resulted in her being dubbed \"The Countess\" by several of the famous names of the time. Her second first was becoming the First Lesbian to be inseminated in Britain and then being awarded custody of her female lover's child after the sudden death of that lover. Controversy was never far away. Despite bringing up the two children, Janis became heavily involved in campaigning for human rights and environmental issues, in the UK and overseas. She became an avid fighter against abuses such as sex trafficking and took up the cause of women's right to vote in Kuwait. Janis also became involved in Jewish-Palestinian politics through a Freedom Fighter lover, and she is still active in Israeli-Palestinian and other Middle Eastern issues till this day. Her son Nick, now nearing forty was married in March 2011 and with her adopted daughter who lives in Australia, the whole family took part in the ceremony. A very modern family, with a very open attitude. Janis lives in a wonderful old house in Northants with a former lover whom she describes as her dearest friend.", "related": [], "rank": 4011223, "title": "Love Lies Bleeding: Memoirs of a Sexual Revolutionary", "author": "Janis Hetherington", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author is really\ngreat at mixing the light-hearted side with the tragedy that lines both\ncharacters' lives.     One of my favourite quotes is this one:     \"Thieves are after things like gold and silver. People don't go around stealing hearts.     I disagree, my lady. For you have certainly stolen mine.\"In the end, it left me with the lingering impression that sometimes feelings are as indestructible as mechanical hearts.(Tower of Babel review from Shelfari)", "related": ["B00KH7ZUD8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I’m a 42 year old, married Mum of two boys who lives in the pretty little town of Oxford located in New Zealand’s South Island. Writing is something I have always used as a way of expressing myself and my first foray into the romantic and humorous world of chick lit is recorded in my thirteen year old self’s compulsory school journal. In it, much to the delight of my English teacher, I described in minutiae the heartbreak of being dumped after my first school disco. It was a scene I re-wrote into The Brazilian Job my first novel.  After my first son was born I attended a creative writing course and the first piece I ever penned was published by a New Zealand parenting magazine. I went on to write humorous, opinion styled pieces of my take on parenting but when the necessity for being politically correct got too much I set myself the challenge of writing a novel. The result was The Brazilian Job. The story opens in Dublin where my now hubby and I based ourselves back in the Millennium when the Celtic Tiger was roaring. My second novel Second-hand Jane is also set in Dublin because it provides such a character filled backdrop. We have a love of travel and starting our family in 2004 hasn’t changed that.  In 2008 we crossed Argentina, Chile and Uruguay by bus with backpacks and our two boys plonked in strollers - it was fantastic. Last year we visited LA, the Greek Islands, France and Hong Kong with our boys and that has only managed to scratch the tip of the wish list. It has also given me loads of ideas for future stories.", "related": ["B00JAOKSBI"], "rank": 116450, "title": "Second-Hand Jane", "author": "Michelle Vernal", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Nelson was born in a little farmhouse on the prairie in eastern North Dakota in 1944. Some doctors made house calls back in those days. He remembers kerosene lamps, bathing in a large galvanized tub, and their phone number was a long ring followed by four short ones, and everybody in the neighborhood could rubberneck. (Imagine that today!) James has been telling stories most of his life. Some of his first memories happened during recess in a one-room country schoolhouse near Walcott, ND. His little friends, eyes wide, would gather round and listen to his every hastily-imagined word.  It was a beginning.  Fascinated by the world beginning to open, he remembers listening to the teacher read to all twelve kids in the eight grades. He was living in that same house on the land originally homesteaded by his great grandfather, when a savage tornado hit in 1955 and destroyed everything. They rebuilt and his family remained until the early nineteen-seventies when diversified farming began changing to industrial agribusiness (not necessarily a good thing.) He spent four years in the US Navy during the Vietnam War (USS Carbonero and USS Archerfish, both submarines.) After the navy he worked many jobs and finally has settled on a few acres exactly two and one half miles straight west of  the original farmstead, ironically likely the very spot where the 1955 tornado first struck, which sometimes gives him a spooky feeling. A little more Biography: He lives among goldfinches, chickadees, nuthatches, blue jays, crows, cottontails, squirrels, deer, mink, badgers, coyotes, wallflowers, spiderworts, sunflowers, goldenrod, big and little bluestem, switchgrass, needle & thread grass, June berries, chokecherries, oaks, willows, boxelders and cottonwoods, in the outback of eastern North Dakota.", "related": ["B00ICAV5TA"], "rank": 1334070, "title": "New World Order Rising Book 3: The Next Generation Fights On", "author": "James W.

Her personal goal with her writing is to show the reader the character's stories through their dialogue and actions instead of just telling the reader what is happening. In 2012 she became a published Young Adult author, releasing In Between Seasons (The Fall, #1) and the Amazon bestselling thriller, Walking in the Shadows. In 2013 she branched out by using her artistic illustrating talents to publish her first Children's novel, The Adventures of Skippy Von Flippy: Tales of Friendship (Skippy Tales, #1). Cassandra released her first New Adult novel, Love Exactly, which became an Amazon Bestseller overnight in June of 2013. She's currently working on her new New Adult Contemporary Romance, Beautifully Flawed. The first novel in the series, Flawed Perfection is scheduled to be published on March 7, 2014.

I  liked the 1918 story for its quiet depth.  It is so meditative, so spiritual in all its historic and tragic results. The vignettes you have carved around Havelock represent a wide view of life in and around this small village.  From the country meetings, the dances, the fishing, the problems with taxes and dogs, to god knows what you have created an insightful picture of what really involves people interacting with each other. In general you are great with description, with dialogue, with irony,  with insight into people and places.  I am proud just to know a writer like you.\"", "related": ["B00G4TYPUW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unfortunately, they did happen - according to the insistent early morning ringing of Matt's hotel phone - and in spite of top of the charts chemistry between them, Jules can't stand the thought that Matt might be cheating on someone else to be with her. This complex love story melds romance with details of the back stage antics of \"Jewelweed\" as the band rockets to fame amid a dizzying concert schedule, chronic drinking, in-fighting, illness, one night stands, and heartbreak. Readers are taken back to a simpler time, 1970s L.A., without email or cell phones, when cassette tapes and cigarettes were cool. Some readers may be disappointed when the main characters smoke pot or avoid facing their alcoholism, yet some of their decisions, especially early in the book, would be very difficult to explain otherwise. Although this is about a romance and there are some hot times between the sheets, the sexual tension and relationship negotiation that are standard are not the main focus of the narrative.\" -ABNA Publishers Weekly ReviewerPublishers Weekly is an independent organization. Review based on an unpublished manuscript version of  Book 3\"The strongest aspect of this piece is the immediate sense of place it invokes. The reader is swept into the concert feeling, and the memory of seeing a former lover. The hesitation of pursuing the past and the uncertainty of how things will work out with someone you were once close to but drifted away from, is done well.\" -ABNA Expert Reviewer", "related": ["B00HXOF6S2"], "rank": 1061081, "title": "Rising Sun, Half Moon, Rock Stars (Six Silver Strings D)", "author": "Lisa Gillis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
