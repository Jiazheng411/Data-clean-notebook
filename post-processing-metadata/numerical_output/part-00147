To find the answers, Ariete must revisit Zebulonia's ancient origins and encounter its past inhabitants, including the mystical peasant Dolcissimo. Ariete frequently describes natural and scientific phenomena as he seeks a higher consciousness that is neither strictly religious nor rationalistic. One sage, Friar Onorio, offers him a definition of this immortal condition: \"The One that incorporates the fleeting essences of the dead bodies is the vortex that tends towards immobility, that is, towards immortality, where there are no spinning atoms, no memory.\" Bonaviri's rarefied spiritual poetics are best appreciated by those who enjoy undertaking inexplicable journeys.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2238290, "title": "Dolcissimo", "author": "Giuseppe Bonaviri", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

James senses this but soldiers on, trying to hold together his fragile extended family and his business--even as tourists show up, anxious to steal shavings from the shop floor. In the end, James understands that \"he [Jesus] had to be somebody's brother.\" James, rather like Martha in Joyce Landorf's bittersweetI Came to Love You Late(1977), is an empty vessel when the furies descend upon his brother, and then he is filled up again.John MortCopyright © American Library Association.

Marti and Vik are also under pressure to identify the skeleton of a 28-year-old mixed-race male, apparently shot in the chest and sealed in the closet of an old building for more than 50 years. To make matters worse, Marti and Vik must each cope with the illnesses of their respective spouses. Meanwhile, several elderly residents of Lincoln Prairie guard family secrets that could provide important clues to solving the two murders.

He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was noted for remarkably intense study. In 1646 he commenced a sixteen-year pastorate at St. Stephen's, Walbrook. He showed strong Presbyterian views during the civil war, with, however, an attachment to the king, and in 1651 he was imprisoned briefly with some other ministers for his share in Christopher Love's plot to recall Charles II of England. He was released on 30 June 1652, and was formally reinstated as vicar of St. Stephen's Walbrook. He obtained great fame and popularity as a preacher until the Restoration, when he was ejected for Nonconformity. Notwithstanding the rigor of the acts against dissenters, Watson continued to exercise his ministry privately as he found opportunity. Upon the Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 he obtained a license to preach at the great hall in Crosby House. After preaching there for several years, his health gave way, and he retired to Barnston, Essex, where he died suddenly while praying in secret. He was buried on 28 July 1686.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some exiled sugar barons have made second fortunes, like Tio Ramon, head of the Suarez family and Lupe's father's lifelong friend. When Ramon's nephew and co-owner of the family sugar mills receives a buyout offer and then disappears, he asks her Papi for help and the dutiful daughter gears up immediately. Lupe is not always so skillful at juggling her two lives, that of a cosseted daughter, still living at home and pinning medals of the Virgin to her brassiere strap, with that of the emancipated single woman, a savvy PI with lovers and a wardrobe to die for. The author exploits this dichotomy to sometimes hilarious and sometimes tragic effect. As Detective Anderson of the Miami police points out, bodies seem to accumulate around her. Loyalty, tradition, principle and justice guide her, although she's not above taking a few shortcuts to get what she needs. She will go to extraordinary lengths for family, friends and clients, often at no small cost to herself, as is the case when she winds up in the hospital. This present challenge is a chance to gain her father's approval of her career choice, even though he may not like what she uncovers. Garcia-Aguilera saves her best surprise until last, leaving fans wanting more.

She provides an in-depth introduction and biographical information that puts Horton in context, and she occasionally corrects errors of previous critics. Sherman also gives an insightful if brief analysis of his poetry. She particularly focuses on his connection with the University of North Carolina, where the self-educated Horton was campus poet for years. Because he was enslaved for 68 years, one of Horton's most powerful and poignant subjects is the desire for liberty, which was often cruelly snatched from him. Sherman's edition will aid in securing Horton's place as a significant 19th-century American poet. Recommended for larger poetry collections.?Louis J.

Many great titles are mentioned and talked about, along with some dry nerd humor, making this an honest, enjoyable read. Gamers, for the win!Great bookIt's a good read the author gives honest answers about the game industry. Good and bad alike. Not alot of mention of specific games but a great overview.

I was also reminded ofThe Boxcar Children, and I think this series is a nice step up for readers who have aged out of those but still want a good, clean story without violence or foul language. Non-Christian readers may not relate to the religious themes presented here, but certainly the mystery is appealing to everyone. --Katie Ahearn,Secrets & Sharing Soda2011-05-04This is a great Christian mystery for pre-teen girls. Even though the girls do get into trouble on occasion, they do have to learn there are consequences to those decisions. It is very cleanly written, no shock value, but a wholesome mystery to keep young minds entertained. Even though I had not read any of the other books in this series I didn't feel like I had missed anything. It did make me want to go back and catch up on the other characters that I met in this book. --Jacque StengelGood Family Reads2011-07-23", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To prepare forAstronomy, I took time to reread \"Dagon\" and \"The Dunwich Horror.\" Truthfully, Wadholm's style is more tomytaste than Lovecraft's is. He moves faster. He uses language at least as well. Modern readers will probably like him better. --C.J. Czelling,Strange HorizonsWadholm’s first novel is a welcomed addition to the Cthulhu Mythos tales written by many other writers. The novel uses it and the other projects to tell a very interesting story that should be enjoyed by the casual horror reader as well as the Cthulhu Mythos collector.

In exploring Bush's reasons for invading Iraq, narrative psychologist McAdams (The Person) taps behavioral science to probe the 43rd president's psyche, resulting in a fascinating, fun, and highly unusual profile. McAdams sees the answer in a \"perfect psychological storm\" of personality traits that came together at a particular moment in history. The first-born son of a privileged family, Bush is a \"blazing extravert\" who, after the death of his sister, comforted his grieving mother with humorous antics. Though he entered adulthood as a hard drinking and carousing frat boy, marriage and a religious transformation helped him conquer alcoholism and catapulted him into the White House, the redemptive turnaround narrative that Americans admire. Bush also, however, according to McAdams, exhibited a \"low openness to experience\" that made him unreceptive to other points of view. McAdams upends the conventional wisdom regarding Bush's relationship with his father, finding that the son most often expressed admiration and love, turning the invasion of Iraq into more of a demonstration of filial devotion than an attempt to upstage his dad. Pay no heed to the ponderous title; this accessible and engaging psychobiography easily moves into a must-read tier of works on George W.

His writing moves instinctively between exquisitely described strategy in the ring and the personalities, characters, and inner workings of select 1960s and early '70s boxers (Charles “Sonny” Liston, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Jerry Quarry, George Foreman, and Jimmy Ellis). Rabe pries open the inner motivations of these title contenders and lays bare what influenced their decisions and behaviors in ways the subjects themselves might not have been able to express. For Rabe, fist-fighters (and oddly, Monty Rock III, a singer of that era) are emblematic of the common people and our endurance of loss, pain, suffering, reputation damage, and hard work. Ultimately, the past and aging both come to haunt boxers more acutely than the rest of us. No boxing knowledge is needed to partake in this psychologically charged, deftly written Kindle Single. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00K5SO2YM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unlike his earlier work, based on his professional training as a doctor and pathologist and his scientific knowledge of mushrooms, Musings is the recounting of personal experiences and observations collected over many decades about the obsession that many of us share with him: the gathering of wild mushrooms. Musings is not the typical book with a story line from beginning to end. Nevertheless, most of its twenty eight rather short chapters focusing on individuals, places, happenings, and opinions that impacted Denis sensitivity share a leitmotif: the sustained and unfinished quest for the ever larger mother lode. With his usual wry wit, keen insight, and the recount of some outrageous moments, Denis amuses the reader from cover to cover. Since the narrative is not linear, the reader can choose to read Chapter 25 before chapter 5 or 11 or... since each is basically an independent essay. I can attest to the allure of the prose and the situations with one example. A passage in chapter 9 held me at end of my seat and feeling goose pimples as I vicariously drove up the Cascade Mountains on an ice-covered highway waiting for the moment in which the vehicle would skid off and crash at the bottom of the slope, even though I know that Denis and his buddy are alive and well. I think it is not because the suspense of many of the events, but that they resonate with our own experiences during our own quest. Chapter 20 reflects on the somewhat antagonistic feelings of camaraderie and competition in the search for elusive finds, in this case, morels. It is the aspiration to be the first, the luckiest, and the acceptance that it is reasonable even when upstaging a friend. It is all right, Denis declares candidly, we are human males. It is personal, yet documentary of an avocation and also educative. Musings should be appreciated by mycologists and naturalists of all ages because it includes something for everyone. To the seasoned ones, it will stir reminiscences of past hunts; to the active ones, the renewed interest in an unparalleled pursuit; and to the budding amateurs, the lure to the thrill of a major discovery. Musings is certainly a perfect companion to sit in front of a glowing fire, glass on hand, during the winter interlude as we anticipate our own future reenactments of similar circumstances. It will be equally satisfying when relaxing during balmy weather. Musings is reading of guaranteed delight. --Fungi Magazine (Albert Casciero)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so\nvolumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus\ninternal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few\ncaveats. I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if\nnot a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the shelf!\nWhile still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of\nsub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar.The first two\nbooks in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of\nBeta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.Shardswas my very first\nnovel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but continues the tale the\nnext day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of\nbeginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these\ntwo. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in between.)The\nWarrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin,\nMiles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet\nby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space\nopera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best\ndiscover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes another good place\nto jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read\nbeforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make more sense if read afterThe Warrior's\nApprentice.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its\ntitle story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most readers recommend picking up this story\nlater. It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn  Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already\nhaveThe Vor Game, you likely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe Spirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or\naquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to\nspawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe Sharing\nKnife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage, andHorizon--which\nI broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided\ninto non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The third book actually takes place a few\nhundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.) Some readers\nthink the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case, the publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book is a boon for\nthe serious King collector trying to suss out the truly rare and\nvaluable in King's prolific oeuvre. There is even a bibliography of all\nKing's works with original publication dates, which I don't think I've\never seen gathered into one index before. Wood also notes all films, TV\nshows, websites, video games, music, and e-books derived from King's\nstories or original material. I don't think you'd find a more complete\nindex of all things Stephen King.In addition to the story summaries, each major character and setting\nhas a place in the encyclopedia. (I fail to understand why characters\naren't alphabetized by last name, but that's a minor quibble.) Wood\ntraces characters through all works in which they appear and provides\ndetailed descriptions of King's most important settings. He even notes\nwho played a particular character in the TV or film version, if there\nwas one. There is so much fascinating trivia to pore over in these\nentries. The listings reveal all of the interesting connections between\nthe stories, a reference I've been wanting for a while. It was obviously\n an immense project, and I'm glad Wood undertook it.Stephen King: A Literary Companionwill be of interest to any serious King fan or collector.Blog Critics.org - Books", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book will appeal to the advanced student and knowledgeable amateur and may prove useful catalyst for discussion among research teams or those engaged in cross-disciplinary studies.\" (Reference Reviews,February 2009)\"Sarkar and Plutynski have compiled a series of essays about the philosophical implications of traditional and emergent biological studies. Among the areas discussed are genetics, immunology and evolutionary psychology.\" (Columbia College Today Alumni Magazine,February 2009)\"A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology will be a very useful guide not only for philosophers but also for historians, sociologists and biologists. Its greatest asset is that it expands beyond the scope of recently published textbooks in philosophy of biology by including a detailed treatment of philosophical aspects of medicine, ecology, mind and behavior and that it places the themes in their historic context. The diversity of areas covered will appeal to students of general interest as well as specialists. Especially helpful is that most chapters end with an extended 'Reference' and often an additional 'Further reading' section that will allow readers to research the individual topics in greater depth.\"(Metapsychology Reviews Online)\"The book is similar to, though different enough to distinguish itself from, its closest kin, The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Biology, edited by Michael Ruse (2008), and The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology, edited by David Hull and Michael Ruse. They do not offer essays on language, biodiversity, or models, which are included in the present volume.

The controversy between those who maintain that the interpretation of conflicts is the crucial healing factor in psychoanalysis and proponents of the relational critique of Freudian clinical theory is overtly faced towards the end of the volume and an highly original and integrative model is offered. This book is not only a rich tribute to the history of ideas but also a great enhancement for analysts to talk to each other across the boundaries of the models in psychoanalysis. This volume is as precious as the Rosetta Stone which has allowed different languages to communicate.””Dr Ellman has a remarkable ability to dwell within the psychic reality of each of the great theorists he discusses, and to make it feel as if each one were explaining his or her theory to you personally. This allows the reader to know them in a deeper way and to experience them in their historical context. Perhaps the most important aspect of the volume are the chapters on contemporary theory and Ellman’s own view of where we are going. This book is an amazing tour de force that anyone who learns, teaches or uses psychoanalytic theory will need to own.””Dr Ellman has written an elegant book that will be experienced as a number of different books. This volume is both a textbook of psychoanalytic theories and an integrative evolving theory in its own right. As a textbook it outlines the essential Freudian hypotheses as well as the contributions of all significant post-Freudian analysts. As an evolving integration Ellman focuses on what he experiences as valuable in each position. The result is Ellman’s own creative synthesis. This book should be read by all colleagues who value the relationship between theoretical and clinical conceptualizations. It advances our clinical understanding as well as our theoretical foundation.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At that show he first viewed some stamps that are also called Hawaiian Missionaries.  These stamps are quite rare.  Also on display were some similar looking stamps called the Grinnells which are thought by some to be forgeries.  Flying back to Hawaii he read more about the Grinnell missionary stamps.  The author is an expert in identifying the work of great European stamp forgers, specifically Sperati and Fournier.  Kassel's impression of the Grinnel missionary stamps was that they are of exceptional quality and in need for further study. The author spent five years researching the Hawaiian Missionaries both the people and the stamps.  To understand and solve a mystery that has intrigued philatelists for decades requires an understanding of the people who created the Hawaiian Missionary postage stamps.  Amazing details were uncovered in the quest for information.  These are endearing stories that everyone will enjoy.

I liked the novel on this initial reading, but the book soon found its way to one of the bottom shelves of my library where it languished for lack of interest. It was only when I agreed to do an eNotated version of Cather's novel for eNotated Classics that I became acquainted with the book once more, and to my surprise, I fell in love with this deeply moving story of settlers in 1880s Nebraska. Because I lived for over thirty years on the Nebraska border, I could easily imagine the power of the land and the realities of frontier existence these early pioneers endured: the constant worry about basic survival; the circumstances of desolation and isolation, particularly for the foreign-born; the relentless heat of summer and the bitter cold of winter; and the plight of rural and small-town women. Cather gave witness to this particular time and place in such a way that she, too, became a pioneer--this time with her realistic, honest, and forthright portrayal of a period of the American experience that elevated her to a prominent place in our literary tradition.I know of no other novel, except F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, that better conveys a sense of loss of what America once was. In Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the narrator Nick Carraway comes to learn that Jay Gatsby's dream--the American dream--is already behind him. \"And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\" Similarly, the feelings that Cather's narrator Jim Burden expresses in regard to Antonia as they part for the last time carry the weight of a time forever gone: the innocence of childhood lost, the landscape forever altered and changed, the promise and hope of America now diminished by the past. \"We reached the edge of the field, where our ways parted. I took her hands and held them against my breast, feeling once more how strong and warm and good they were, those brown hands, and remembering how many kind things they had done for me. I held them now a long while, over my heart. About us it was growing darker and darker, and I had to look hard to see her face, which I meant always to carry with me; the closest, realest face, under all the shadows of women's faces, at the very bottom of my memory. . . . As I went back alone over the familiar road, I could almost believe that a boy and girl ran along beside me, as our shadows used to do, laughing and whispering to each other in the grass.\" It is no coincidence that the last word in both Fitzgerald's and Cather's novels is the \"past,\" the past which is now compromised by the present with little hope for the future.Perhaps one needs time and experience to recognize the importance of certain works of literature such as Willa Cather's masterpiece--time and experience in which one is able to recognize the past with a minimum of nostalgia and sentimentality, to comprehend personal loss and physical as well as emotional displacement, and to understand fully what has happened to the prairie of Nebraska, the people who settled there, and the original promise of the greatness of America. My Antonia fulfills all this and more for the contemporary reader.", "related": [], "rank": 16933, "title": "The eNotated My Antonia (Annotated)", "author": "Willa Cather", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is also the secret she's trying desperately to hide. Her parents have enrolled her in boarding school after her older brother is sent to prison for shoplifting. Though they deal in illegal imports, they don't approve of stealing and they want their daughter to make a better life for herself. Bridget is keenly aware of this pressure to succeed at her new school and the fact that they could be in a heap of trouble if their secret comes out. It's difficult to make friends when you can't open up, but Bridget finds a kindred soul in a boy called Menzies. Soon Bridget's familial woes are replaced by a new and more serious predicament—helping Menzie free two Afghani refugee children from a detention center. This novel by Australian author Morris Gleitzman is a companion toBoy Overboard, where refugees Jamal and Bibi are first introduced. It is not necessary to have readBoy Overboardfirst, but many listeners will want to hear the story that inspires Bridget and Menzies' bravery. Gleitzman explores themes of courage, friendship, and social injustice with plenty of humor and intrigue to keep listeners involved. Mary-Anne Fahey's narration perfectly captures Bridget's innocence and quirky sense of humor. It's also fascinating to hear another country's perspective on current world issues.

It’s also the story of people who are down but not out and a rumination on family, courage and responsibility—a book that reverberates long after the last page. Grouchy old Ellie Miller, the “graffiti grandma,” is on a quixotic mission to scrub the graffiti off the mailboxes in her neighborhood. With solvent and rags, she does it at least once a week. One day, she encounters Sarah, a homeless teenage goth girl who offers to help. But they’re wary of each other. In the first chapter, they discover, under a pile of leaves, the body of Peter, a homeless boy who was Sarah’s friend and protector. From there, the plot is off and running, even as it skips around. But that’s OK, since Barney is an agile writer with an uncanny ability to tie the plot strings together. For example, the narrative doesn’t get back to the action of the first chapter until Chapter 11, after all the characters are introduced, each with his or her own back story. There’s Jeffery, another forsaken kid whose grandfather comes to rescue him from a traumatic childhood, though he may not be a real rescuer after all. There’s divorced policeman Matt Trommald and his autistic son, Collin. And there’s Ellie, who’s no saint, though she’s finally sober. She thinks her troubled son, Danny, is long gone—and good riddance—but he might be closer than she thinks. Each chapter has its own appropriate point of view, with Ellie and Sarah in first person, and Matt and Jeffrey in third. As such, it’s easy to get to know Ellie and Sarah and their wary dance around each other; Matt and Jeffrey, less so. Key to the plot is the camp in the nearby dense woods, where young runaways make up a ragtag family. But runaways are turning up dead. Who’s the killer? Fortunately, Barney’s narrative nimbleness helps wrangle the storylines as they race to a satisfying conclusion. A gripping book with compelling characters who don’t want your pity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

Desde 1987 es profesor de literatura hebrea en la Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, en Beersheba, universidad de la cual se convirtio en catedratico de literatura hebrea moderna en 1993. Por otro lado, ha sido profesor y escritor invitado por varias universidades en Estados Unidos, Inglaterra y Alemania, y desde 1991 es miembro de la Academia de la Lengua Hebrea. Ha publicado un gran numero de novelas, entre las que destacan: Mi querido Mijael (1968), Tocar el agua, tocar el viento (1973), Un descanso verdadero (1982), La caja negra (1987), La tercera condicion (1991), No digas noche (1994), El mismo mar (1998) y Una historia de amor y oscuridad (2002), su novela mas autobiografica. Su talento literario lo ha hecho merecedor de numerosos premios internacionales, como el Goethe (2005), el reputado Premio Israeli de Literatura (1998) o el Principe de Asturias de las Letras (2007). Ademas de la novela, Amos Oz ha cultivado la escritura periodistica y ensayistica. Desde 1967 ha publicado numerosos articulos sobre el conflicto arabe-israeli, promulgando su compromiso basado en el reconocimiento mutuo y la coexistencia entre Israel y Palestina en Gaza y Cisjordania. Entre los ensayos mas conocidos, cabe destacar Under This Blazing Light (1978), In the Land of Israel (1983), The Slopes of Lebanon (1987), Israel, Palestine, and Peace (1994), All Our Hopes (1998) y But These are Two Different Wars (2002).

I became interested in writing at an early age and started writing my first novel at the age of fourteen. However, the project was abandoned when I developed other interests such as girls, cars, and sports. I joined the Army during the height of the Vietnam War and after graduating from helicopter flight school, I served a tour in Viet Nam where I logged over a thousand combat flight hours and survived three helicopter crashes. After returning from Viet Nam, I started writing about my Vietnam experiences and over the course of several years, I finally completed my memoirs which I hope to publish someday.  I married my wife, Bonnie, shortly before leaving the service and after completing my military obligation, we returned to Colorado where I originally planned to pursue a career in law enforcement. However, after dabbling in law enforcement, I found my niche in retail sporting goods and spent twenty years with a Denver based national sporting goods company. After a very successful career with that company, I went to work for a second national sporting goods retailer. My job responsibilities with both companies required a significant amount of policy and procedure writing, but I really didn’t have time to do any creative writing until about five years ago when travel became a much bigger part of my job. When I was away from home, rather than spend my evenings in the hotel bar or watching TV, I again took up the pen and started writing western novels which resulted in my first two published works.  My life-long interests and hobbies include western history, antique firearms, old cowboy junk, and Native American collectables. The expertise gained as a result of my hobbies, have contributed significantly to the realism and detail correctness of my novels.   I recently retired and now spend most of my time writing and enjoying life with my wife, Bonnie, on our small Colorado ranch, where we keep a couple of mules, horses, and raise Black Angus cattle. “Life don’t get any better than that.”", "related": ["B00C8W23P8"], "rank": 925611, "title": "Beneath The Rustler's Moon (The Gentry Brothers Book 1)", "author": "Norm Bass", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The writing is good - descriptive text that allows the reader's mind to provide pictures of how they perceive Middle Eastern bazaars and deserts would appear to them. Doumin's dialog reflects his English is a second language while Vivi and Scott use more American English. Emotional interactions between Westerners (including English) and middle Easterners have been fodder for novels for many years; this concept is well-established. Here the author has brought this concept into the modern world and the reader becomes interested in how much may have changed - or not - amongst the Bedouin.ABNA Expert Reviewer 2 The author certainly created a strong, central character in Vivi, and Doumin seems to be an equally strong character. I appreciate characters that have strong voices, and opinions. By giving central characters truly concrete opinions and viewpoints, it makes it easy to decide whether or not to route for them. This is certainly a fish out of water story, with a new twist.Some of the wording I found offensive. That doesn't necessarily mean I won't read the book, I would continue reading to see if the characters opinions change, if they learn anything about their biases, and can grow. I'm not sure I got that from this excerpt, on the other hand, I don't find anything said or written unforgivable either. I like the glimpse into the Bedouin culture, and hope that the writer continues to explore that, as by doing so in a book that kids can relate to (fish out of water, first love, etc) kids will learn without even knowing it.", "related": ["B008I4JJES"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Explore James City County's ancient landscape. One will find, even in these modern times, traces of the past,\" writes Sara E. Lewis at the end of her new book, a pictorial history of rural James City. For those relatively new to this area, Lewis' book is a good place to start your exploration.\"I've had it in mind for awhile, having lived here for 30 years, but it was a difficult decision to do a book about James City County, because there are so many professional historians here,\" Lewis explained during a recent phone interview.Her first pictorial history was about Gloucester County, where she grew up; her second book focused on Mathews County, where her parents grew up and which still has mostly longtime residents. James City and Gloucester counties have many residents relatively new to the area.With hundreds of photographs of the \"people and places that illuminate rural James City, preceding its growth as a predominantly exurban area,\" Lewis' book is a chronological summary of this historic area of Virginia, from the founding of the Jamestown settlement in 1607 to the middle of the 20th century. Oral legends, written memoirs, newspapers, and scholarly research were used to write the text. The photographs, contributed by many individuals whose families have lived in the area for generations, \"capture images of the county beginning about 125 years ago, which commemorate the rural way of life.\"The book is available everywhere, including Barnes and Noble, Amazon and Colonial Williamsburg. The author's website is www.saraelewis.comA brief glimpse at each chapter should whet your appetite to purchase the book, part of the Images of America series by Arcadia Publishing, \"the leading local history publisher in the United States,\" according to its website.Chapter one begins in 1607 with Jamestown, \"first settlement\" of the Virginia Company of adventurers, and covers approximately three decades. In 1634 the royal colony was divided into eight shires, or counties, including James City. The origin of the name Stonehouse is explained.Chapter two focuses on the colonial part of the county, including Kingsmill Plantation, built in the mid-1730s, Governor Berkeley's land, and Powhatan Plantation. Chapter three deals with the \"First American Century,\" from the end of the Revolutionary War to the end of the 19th century. Photographs of Hickory Neck Church and Chickahominy Baptist Church, White Hall and Carter's Grove are included, as are several maps from as far back as the Civil War. Chapter four focuses on the turn of the century, when Norwegian immigrants from the Midwest built the community of Norge in James City County. Chapter five is devoted to Toano, which had become \"the county's primary commercial center\" by the early 20th century.Photos of the Wilkinson and Geddy Store, \"perhaps the busiest one in town,\" and Toano School students are featured. The photographs in chapter six \"help color in the story of the rural James City County way of life.\"Chapter seven covers the period of the two World Wars and Chapter Eight captures more than one \"moment at mid-century.\" Photographs of the county's prominent families, donated by members still living here, are featured throughout the book. Lewis acknowledges all of her sources on page 6; she mentioned Doris Wildenberger, Fred Boelt, and Donna Garrett during our conversation. \"My first love has always been history. It's always been an avocation, if not a vocation,\" Lewis said. She double-majored in history and art at The College of William and Mary and art history at Virginia Commonwealth University, before accepting a position as Curator of Collections with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, in Jackson, Miss.After three years there she moved back to this area and got her MBA at William and Mary. Lewis worked for Colonial Williamsburg for 15 years, doing product development in their Reproductions Program.

I care about what will happen to the characters and look forward to reading further.\"\"Dark\n Under the Cover of Night interested me for the entire excerpt. The\ncharacters are all pretty interesting and there's a lot going on. The\nexcerpt got right to the chase, which hopefully shows the swift pacing\nof the rest of the book. I found myself caring what happened next to\nRaedwyn and she is a very original female protagonist without many of\nthe stereotypical features of female leads.\"Excerpt fromDark Under the Cover of NightThe dragon's head broke\nthrough the rolling banks of mist and glided towards the riverbank. A sleek long ship followed in its wake.\nSilent, despite its great bulk, the Saxon ship emerged from curling tendrils of\nmist that moved like caressing fingers over its curved bow. Raedwyn stood next to her\nmother, on a hill above the river, and watched the long ship approach. Despite\nthat she had been looking forward to this day, nervousness tugged at the pit of\nRaedwyn's stomach and she glanced sideways at her mother. Sensing her\ndaughter's unease, Queen Seaxwyn reached across and squeezed Raedwyn's hand.\nNeither of them spoke as they continued to watch the long ship dock.On the shores of the River\nDeben, Raedwyn's father, Raedwald, King of the East Angles, stood with his son,\nEorpwald, waiting to welcome Cynric the Bold. Nine winters younger than his king,\nCynric was one of Raedwald's most trusted ealdormen - one of noble blood.\nCynric the Bold would soon become a member of the illustrious Wuffinga Dynasty,\nfor tomorrow at noon he and Princess Raedwyn would wed.King Raedwald had just\npassed his fifty-fourth winter but still stood tall and muscular, although silver\nnow threaded his thick, golden hair and his strong face was lined with care and\ngrief. Raedwald had never recovered from the loss of his son, Raegenhere, eight\nyears earlier. Eorpwald, quiet and diffident in comparison to his charismatic\nolder brother, was a poor substitute for Raegenhere.The gentle splash of oars\nbroke the stillness as the newcomers maneuvered their craft towards the water's\nedge. Raedwyn's gaze fastened on the group of men on-board, searching for\nCynric. Despite the twenty-five years age difference, she had heard the\nealdorman was still a striking warrior to behold.The long ship came to rest\nin the deep mud at the riverbank and a group of men disembarked. As they heaved the ship closer to the bank\nthrough knee-deep mud, Raedwyn caught sight of Cynric at last. He was a big,\nbroad-shouldered man and was dressed more richly than his companions. Gold\nrings sparkled across his chest and his arms were heavy with silver bracelets\nand arm rings - all tributes to his heroism in battle. A thick fur cloak hung\nfrom his shoulders. Raedwyn was too far\naway to pick out the details of his face but she could see he had a short blond\nbeard and thick sandy hair flecked through with gray. Raedwyn felt a thrill of\nexcitement. She had hoped he would be handsome.", "related": ["B00AX1D3GE"], "rank": 10120, "title": "Dark Under the Cover of Night (The Kingdom of the East Angles Book 1)", "author": "Jayne Castel", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Around 2007, was when she realized that she was no longer writing just out of pure enjoyment.  As time progressed, she began to experience life challenging events that allowed her to keep record of everything that was happening in her life.  The more and more she wrote, God showed her that this was not just beneficial for her but RéJoyce’s assignment was to minister to His people in this way.  The contents that God has allowed RéJoyce to share within are to benefit whomever the hands or eyes of it will reach. She believes that the writings are a form of ministry for the broken hearted, for the poor, for the weary, and for anyone that is waiting to hear from God. RéJoyce knows that if you are ready to receive a changed mind, and are ready to receive the promises of God, “While I Wait” is one of many that will equip you with what you need to begin.  The Bible says, “And let us not grow weary in our well doing, for in due season, we will reap if we faint not”.

Reading someone’s story is akin to peeking into their soul. Stories are like rides on a cloud high in the sky not knowing where you’re going or what the end will be.  Writing, you get to make the choices; steer, control the direction.  Create characters.  Make them do things, and then watch them take on a life of their own, as so often is the case.  Writing allows me to share with many while staying hidden in the pages.   One of the things I write about is empowerment in women, so it can be passed on, as Emma does with Chloe in Finding Burnt Ranch.  The reasons why women and girls stay in abusive relationships are complex and varied. Writing about Chloe being brutalized by her boyfriend, and Emma wanting to empower her was about that, and about finding strength yourself.  I find imperfection fascinating; a person’s strengths always being tested by their weaknesses.   My favorite characters are strong women faced with relationship struggles or internal struggles.  Thematically, I want a reader to be inspired besides being entertained.   I grew up in Detroit and graduated Michigan State. When I started to travel, I found out how powerful the connection to Nature can be; walking in the mountains, wading in rivers, or sleeping on the ground under the stars. It took years to find a place like Burnt Ranch.  It’s one of the best places I’ve ever found to rest my heart, to be aware of how small I am on this abundant planet, and to leave a small footprint while carrying it all in my soul.   If you have read Finding Burnt Ranch, I would love to hear your feedback.  I’m rather socially inept, so writing is easier than talking.  Additionally, I’m not very good at social media, but I’m trying.  Visit me on Facebook so I can get better at it.", "related": [], "rank": 4611914, "title": "Finding Burnt Ranch eBook", "author": "Judy Kalinowski", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you have enjoyed this book, A.J. asks that you share with others and PLEASE leave a kind review on Amazon. As an independent author, word of mouth is his only advertising.   http://amzn.to/14C5dj9  About the Author Anthony J. VanDorn (or A.J. to his friends) began writing while laid-up due to an injury he received working as a police officer with the Houston Police Department in Houston, Texas. The idea to create a character such as Seth Rayder was always a notion he played with, but it wasn’t until he found himself unable to walk did he finally put a computer on his lap and get to work. Now retired from the Houston Police Department after 29 years, he has finally devoted the time to finish his first novel and bring Seth Rayder to life for his first adventure. As a police officer, A. J. worked in a variety of assignments. When writing, he wanted to bring out that same kind of diversity in his character (but in a more heroic and adventurous setting). He enjoys reading fast-pace action-thriller novels, nothing too technical, and hopes his readers find the same in his stories. Recently, A. J. and his wife have embarked on a commercial adventure to open and operate a cabin and bed-and-breakfast business in the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas (not far from his friend Seth Rayder ). A. J. is passionate about his writing and enjoys talking to his readers. He has many more ideas in the works, and Endless Age is just the first of upcoming Seth Rayder adventures. Cheers!

The only child of two morally strong, hard working, salt of the earth couple who's love for each other, and for me was boundless. I began to write at the age of 8 years old when I wrote my version of the bible story, The Good Samaritan. When I received rave reviews from my teacher and classmates, I was inspired to continue with the hobby that quickly became my passion. This passionate affair has been ongoing for 30 years now and there are no signs of it waning. Though, I will admit for a time when I was pregnant with my own first born son, Christian, the affair cooled. Cooled, but never faded, I soon found out when the desire to write came calling once again when I needed to find a way to cope with heartbreaking news. I always knew that there was something wrong with Christian from the moment he was born, I and the doctors, just could not put their finger on it. While physically, Christian thrived, mentally/emotionally not so well. His behaviours were a little disturbing. Finally after 9 years of pulling my hair out, and slipping into some pretty dark places myself, he was diagnosed with Autism. My method of coping was to write a story about his/our journey called Forever Christian. Passion renewed. Now, a girl can only write about real life for so long without jumping back into the world of make believe. Venturing into the world of the supernatural, Ghosts, witches, werewolves and my personal favourite, Vampires. I enjoy all sorts of vampires and I admit I am fascinated with the modern romantic kind, aka the Cullen and the Salvatores of this world! However, I wanted to bring the vampires into the real world where they face real issues that us mortals struggle with. Thus began the weaving of tale of my first book, I am proud to say, published here on Amazon Kindle! Destiny of the Vampire has been born! It is my sincerest hope that I will be fortunate enough for this story to find its way into your hands and that you will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed writing it for you. I also hope that this could be the start of a wonderful audience/author relationship and that we can share many tales together.

From street crime to elite crime and everything in between, the chapters provide solid data on the myriad social control challenges disasters present. Authors take on important topics in the field, such as the conditions under which post-disaster looting occurs, increases in violence against women that often accompany disasters and disasters that occur as the result of corporate crime. Many findings in the new edition ofCrime and Criminal Justice in Disastercall into question taken-for-granted assumptions about disasters and their effects, while others suggest important questions for further research.'' --Kathleen Tierney, Professor of Sociology and Director of the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder''For decades researchers have often described the post-disaster environment as a 'therapeutic community,' a place where people come together and do whatever it takes to restore normalcy to their lives. While this pattern of prosocial behavior prevails in many cases, the revised edition ofCrime and Criminal Justice in Disasterreminds us that there is also a dark side of disaster. For communities with unusually high crime rates, widespread poverty, and rampant political corruption, for example, disasters can sometimes make matters even worse. In some cases, disasters such as oil spills and levee failures are crimes themselves, stemming from the negligence of extremely powerful actors. While past research has focused primarily on how organizations respond to disasters after they occur, this volume reveals how the actions or inactions of governments and corporations can actually precipitate disasters in the first place. This timely and important book is extremely well written and engaging; it contains contributions from many of the most widely known and highly respected scholars in the field, and it will be a valuable resource for courses in disasters and emergency management, criminology and criminal justice, sociology, political science and public administration.'' --Gary R.

Wheeler. More than that, these are the words that have coloured Carmen’s existence. As a young child, she would sit avidly in front of the television, hoping against hope that today’s cartoon instalment would be a Halloween special. These are the words that drove her to start writing, to want there to be more in the world than the monochrome of reality. As a result, she immersed herself in the vampire genre, studied it where she could and learnt from it where her knowledge was lacking. Her first serious foray into literature – the point at which she first realised she wanted to write – was the day she opened Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire. She was so inspired that she began writing her first novel that very night; though thankfully, her perfectionism drove her to delete it very soon after its inception. Anne Rice was not only her biggest inspiration, but also her gateway drug. She very soon devoured every form of vampire literature she could find, from Poppy Z. Brite to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels based closely on the television series. Carmen studied Journalism, English, Editing and Visual Communications, amongst other things and consequently went into academia. She is now a part-time editor and copy-writer, as well as an English lecturer in Midrand, South Africa. Carmen’s interests are varied and she places emphasis on using vampiric settings to tell stories about other, more engaging topics of discussion, such as BDSM, Stockholm Syndrome, and homo-eroticism. Her one biggest regret in life is that she could not study vampire literature in an academic environment.", "related": ["B008RZY37Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I regularly tell people that I learned to write with that book -- and it took me ten years to do so. Since publishing ANGELS over a year ago, I've  been thrilled with the response I've gotten about that novel and its sequel, SINS OF THE FATHER. One of the greatest joys for me has been how well-received the characters have been, as they are all near and dear to my heart.When I set out to write SOUTHERN CROSS, I had a loose idea of what I wanted: I knew it would take place in Kentucky; I knew Diggs' past would figure significantly into unfolding events; and I knew that key elements of the conspiracy involving Erin's father would come to light. Beyond that, however, the entire novel was a mystery to me. I'm thrilled with what ultimately landed on the page, as I think it provides compelling background for readers looking for additional insight into the Diggs and Solomon dynamic, gives some tantalizing new information about the conspiracy, and -- most surprisingly for me -- shows a whole new side of Erin, as she struggles to come to terms with the violence she's encountered in the previous novels.I love watching these characters as they evolve, and their relationships deepen and change over time. I hope readers will enjoy this latest installment of the Erin Solomon mysteries half as much as I've enjoyed writing it!All the best,Jen Blood", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 35, "rating_average": 4.5429, "rating_total": 159.0}

The turbulent sixties led her away from her first loves of church, reading, and writing. The only part of her faith that remained was the belief that we were made to help others. That belief led her to graduate as an RN in 1974. Karen married in 1975, and raised two children. After going through a Life in the Spirit Seminar, she found peace and eternal love in the faith that would sustain her. In 1990, she became very ill and was eventually diagnosed with end stage Lyme Disease and was unable to work as a nurse anymore.

The equipment used to cut and haul the trees is huge and many of the devices have interesting names such as knuckleboom loader and feller buncher. The full-color photographs of these machines are plentiful and clear. The author assumes some prior knowledge of logging, as the text, although minimal, is not always easy to understand, and not all unfamiliar words are defined in context: \"After this logger fells the tree, he wraps a choker chain around the butt of the felled tree and hitches the chain to the skidder winch cable.\" However, readers can turn to a glossary for more detailed explanations of timber terms.

His work has been syndicated in newspapers ranging from the San Francisco Chronicle to the Cleveland Plain Dealer to the Boston Herald.    O'Donnell has written several books, including The Rock Book (Pinnacle, 1975), Born to Rock (Peacock, 1981), Wonderful Tonight  (Hall of Fame, 1993) and The Day John Met Paul (Penguin, 1996; Routledge, 2006).     The Day John Met Paul has been published in several languages, ranging from Japanese to Czech to French, and is available in an audio edition read by Rod Davis, a personal friend of John Lennon.     O’Donnell has appeared frequently on CNN Radio and has done many television interviews. His biggest TV moment came when he didn't appear on the screen at all, but rather had his name show up in a Jeopardy question. The contestant answered correctly for $400.     He holds a Master's Degree from St. Peter's College and studied journalism under New Journalism pioneer Richard Goldstein at New York University. He has also completed graduate courses in Creative Writing and The Teaching of Writing at Harvard University.    Whether sitting front-row-center at an Eric Clapton concert in New York City, or standing front-row-center at the gates of Strawberry Field in Liverpool, O'Donnell has traveled the globe as a journalist for many years, searching out stories.      He is a member of the Authors Guild, the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

If you're a veteran of The Riyria Revelations you might want to read this just for a bit of perspective for future books.The Riyria Chronicles are prequels to my debut series, the Riyria Revelations (published by Orbit from Nov 2011- Jan 2012). If you prefer your tales in chronological order, please do so, as I've taken great care to avoid spoilers. That being said, Chronicles were actually designed to be read after the Riyria Revelations, and veteran readers will be treated to Easter eggs, made possible by having the inside scoop on the entire story arc. These won't be significant plot points, just little extra surprises for those in the know. The bottom line is that readers, both old and new, should find a rewarding experience, and no prior knowledge of Revelations is expected or required.One thing I'd like to mention is the difference of structure between the two series. For those that don't know, I wrote all six books of The Riyria Revelations before publishing any of them. This was absolutely necessary for that particular tale. While I gave each book its own conflict and resolution, there were a number of threads interwoven across the entire series. Mysteries were hinted at, geese needed chasing, and everything was built to support the grand finale. Being a first work, I could afford such luxury. It didn't matter that it took more than a decade to create. After all, no one would be waiting on the next installment. I'm approaching The Riyria Chronicles quite differently. I have no idea how many there will be (beyond the first two books, which are already done), so I'm designing this as an open-ended series, rather than a single tale divided into episodes. The stories are intended to be more like stand-alone novels with less integration from one book to another. The reason is simple. I'm very sensitive about having Royce and Hadrian overstay their welcome. We all know of series, both book and television, that went on longer than they should have. It's sad to see something that was once loved and cherished becoming a shadow of its former self. So by designing Chronicles in this way I can play it by ear when determining whether to release the next adventure.I'm fortunate enough to make my living from writing, and a story, no matter how much I enjoy writing it, doesn't put food on the table if no one is interested. Being a writer in this day and age provides the possibility for more interaction then when Hemingway or Steinbeck wrote. Emails, forum posts, tweets, blog comments, and even a survey I ran made it clear that I hadn't yet reached the point where my characters were being asked to politely find somewhere else to go. So it is the readers who are partially responsible for this series existence and will also play a major role in any additional books. To that end, when you finish this book, please email me atmichael.sullivan.dc@gmail.comand let me know whether you want more or would prefer me to go on to something else. After all you provide me with the income to support my family, the least I can do is give you want you want to read.12/12/12 Edit: Thank you to the folks at Fantasy Faction for including The Crown Tower in their Top 10 Anticipated Books for 2013. I'm honored to be included with such industry greats as Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks, Peter V.

The range of Iranian misconduct since that time has been broad, resulting in the deaths of some one thousand US nationals.  The United States has repeatedly protested these activities and issued numerous threats  but has done little or nothing to deter the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  Instead of responding in self-defense to IRGC surrogate and direct attacks, the United States has focused almost exclusively on Iran’s nuclear program, threatening to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, by force if necessary, and imposing economic sanctions that are damaging Iran’s economy. But threats of force to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons have limited credibility given the long record of US weakness in responding to IRGC aggression, as well as the US failure to follow up on such threats against North Korea. Although using force to destroy or set back Iran’s nuclear program has been kept \"on the table\" by US presidents, the difficulties of justifying and implementing such attacks on Iran’s nuclear program are formidable, with possibly serious collateral consequences, widespread criticism, and ultimate failure.  Equally troublesome, however, is failing to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and attempting instead to contain Iran through the threat of annihilation, missile defense, and economic and political pressure.  A nuclear-armed Iran would increase instability in the Middle East, further embolden the IRGC, and lead to nuclear arms proliferation with catastrophic results.Taking on Iranpresents an alternative and viable approach by which the United States could deal with Iran’s nuclear program without resorting to either preventive attacks or accepting a nuclear-armed Iran. The author urges the United States to exercise its right to defend US forces, nationals, and interests from IRGC aggression—a long overdue, practical, and principled strategic imperative. Military actions against IRGC targets related to its surrogates or terrorist attacks on the United States, he explains, would (unlike preventive attacks on Iran’s nuclear program) be legally defensible, legitimate, practical, and likely to succeed. He explains how defending against IRGC aggression could, in addition to deterring illegal conduct, convince Iran to negotiate in earnest. And he describes in detail how, if Iran does respond to US defensive actions by seeking genuine diplomatic engagement, the United States should engage with Iran on the basis of proven practices applied in US/Soviet negotiations.This book clarifies why, as in dealing with other international security challenges, effective diplomacy based on strength is the most likely formula for securing peace without resort to major conflict.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I think that when she wrote she was really creating a play;\nin three acts if it was a novel or a playlet when she wrote her stories. If she\ncould have been remembered for her stage career but forgotten as an author,\nthat would have been just fine with her. Martha Jane Jones was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1917 to a father of\nWelsh-Scottish heritage and a mother whose ancestors were among the first\nEuropeans in New Amsterdam and Virginia.\nWithin eighteen months of her birth, her mother Noreen had died in the\nflu epidemic and her young heartbroken father allowed his parents to raise\nlittle Martha Jane. \"The Peppermints\", like all of my mother's short stories were essentially\ntrue stories, with only the names or places changed. While many of her other\nstories are longer, \"The Peppermints\" is truly a \"short story\". Six of her novels were published, but none of her many short stories ever\nfound a buyer. Reading the rejection letters from magazines, (yes, she saved\neach one) over and over the theme is, \"it's a beautiful story, but not\nrealistic\" or \"well written, but not modern enough.\" I am pretty sure that \"The Peppermints\" was written in 1970 or '71. My\nMother died in 1990, and it seemed that her short stories would never see the\nlight of day. Well, now in this modern era thanks to amazon, we have kindle,\nand so I am publishing all her unpublished stories, starting with \"The\nPeppermints\". I hope that they find an appreciative audience! Evan RofheartOctober 2013New York City", "related": [], "rank": 642424, "title": "The Peppermints", "author": "Martha Rofheart", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

F Troop had a different story from most other companies in that its young men bonded together via a very harsh plebe system that, thankfully, no longer exists.  I witnessed these events unfold from G Company next door in Padgett-Thomas barracks.  I saw these stories unfold and am amazed at how precise his memories are and find this book quite fun to read.  Many thanks to my Citadel and law school classmate for doing such a great job!\"--Billy Jenkinson, Citadel Class of 1968, former chairman and emeritus member of The Citadel Board of Visitors\"Tom Worley has captured a place in time--the Citadel in the 1960s. Alumni will share the memories and all readers will marvel at Tom's ability to portray the trials and tribulations of being a cadet back then.\"--Lt. Gen. John W. Rosa, USAF (retired), class of 1973, president, The Citadel\"For those who've attended the Citadel, they'll recognize--either with smiles or winces of remembrance--these stories.  For those who know Citadel grads this book is a glimpse into the world that shaped the Citadel grad they know.  Tom Worley, with a storyteller's eye for detail, takes us to a place many of us will never see firsthand and, for those who lived it, a memory they'll immediately see as their own.\"--Cathy Pickens, author of Charleston Mysteries and Southern Fried\"F Troop and Other Citadel Stories is a must read for anyone who wears the ring. TomWorley has added his name to the list of accomplished Citadel authors. He takes the reader backto that first step through the sally port and along the arduous path of those who joined The LongGray Line, to include the heartbreak of losing classmates in combat. The book is well-written, insightful, humorous and always candid. Congratulations to Tom, to F Troop and to all the Citadel men and women who made the journey.\"--Michael Duffy, Master of Revels, Citadel class of 1965\"When I read Tom Worley's powerful collection of Citadel stories, it was like reading my own novel The Lords of Discipline as told from a different point of view. The Citadel marks its graduates in both glorious and troubling ways. The plebe system shapes us with its dark, indelible matrix forever and the Citadel experience becomes the most commanding force in our lives.

To think its conditions, its stakes, its possible or vanished meaning anew. That is what 'deconstruction' means. It arises from a real consideration, in the strongest sense, of the chosen object. Today, it is obviously necessary to make Zionism that object, among others-not only the word itself but also all the significations it carries. That is why one must salute the initiative behind this book. -- Jean-Luc Nancy, Professor Emeritus, Strasbourg, France This unique book includes perceptive analyses of Zionism by some of today's leading philosophers. A 'must read' for anyone seeking the theoretical tools to address the conflict in the Middle East and committed to global social justice. -- Simon Critchley, Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy, The New School for Social Research For those of us who believe that the political and moral health of the global world depends on a just and fair solution to the problems that beset Palestine/Israel, this book is an illuminating contribution. These essays written by diverse and gifted hands explore the politics of nationhood and territorial coexistence from a plurality of philosophical, theological, and secular perspectives. The most interesting essays lead us towards the condition of the Middle East via a reflection on other political situations defined by proximity, ambivalence, and antagonism. This is an ambitious and engrossing volume. -- Homi K. Bhabha, Anne F.

Of the five writers and stories reviewed mine was the only one that had positive reviews, it was titled Blue Moon Rising. I did just the reverse, where I adapted my screenplay into manuscript form because it was a story that had strong characters and elements. There is a wealth of stories to tell and I am looking forward to sharing them with all my readers. After spending a few years writing screenplays I've discovered my first love is writing novels. I will be downloading my seventh one soon.  I do appreciate comments on how you enjoyed my stories.

Over the course of a year (more or less) he worked on Memories of the Dead, his first novel, eventually bringing it to attention of several friends, who read the book and encouraged him to attempt publication. With his wife, Tammy, as supreme cheerleader of this effort, he self-published that work in early 2012.  MINIMAL is his second full-length novel. Phil resides in his home state of Iowa and surrounds himself with inspiration in form of family and friends, and still works in a profession that grants him the money to pay the bills.", "related": ["B00CBJXM1M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story you are about to read, though fictional in some significant respects, is based to a substantial degree on these memories.Why should child sexual abuse survivors write about their abuse for publication? A number of reasons present themselves, including the validation and support survivors can receive for their efforts at healing from their own abuse experiences through acquainting themselves with those of others; the understanding that people who have never experienced such abuse can gain of the severity of the damage it can inflict, during childhood and beyond; and the vital role essays, memoirs, stories, and other writing by survivors can have in motivating people to work steadfastly towards the realization of whatever improvements might be made in human societies--however gradually, in the years, decades, and centuries ahead--to lessen the occurrence of child sexual abuse and to better assist its victims.But more important, for me, than any other reason, or, perhaps, than all other reasons combined, is the role that survivors' stories can serve in helping to break down the toxic shame and taboo that continue to surround child sexual abuse as a topic of public discussion--shame and taboo that survivors often begin to internalize from childhood and that, in any case, can make it all the more difficult for survivors, as adults, to face the effects the abuse has had on their lives and to do all that they need to do for their healing.May this story serve these worthy ends.John BrooksJanuary 2014", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
