He could never sit down for long. The television company had asked if they could conduct the interview in the farmhouse kitchen at Featherstone Hall, saying the kitchen would make him seem more human and approachable.Thinking publicity would help raise awareness of his campaign, he had agreed, and now he found himself sitting in the glare of camera lights, while a girl with dirty toenails and an earnest air snapped a clapperboard in his face—which was doing nothing for his blood pressure. 'That's it,' he said, standing up.'But, Lieutenant Colonel Grant…Cade.' She clearly thought that using his first name might soften him. She was destined to fail. 'You haven't finished interviewing the prospective candidates for the post of…' she paused for dramatic effect '… Housekeeper to a Hero—''If you mean the stooges—'The earnest one's eyes gleamed. ''No one else turned up… And so in order to prevent the interview from being a complete disaster, I provided—''Stooges from your team? Yes, I know.' He pushed his chair back. And now you can all pack up and go home; this interview is over.'He stood at his full height, knowing that with the top of his head brushing the beams he was an intimidating sight. He should have known it was a mistake to let anyone into his life, and that it was just an excuse to pry. The only reason he'd done it this time was because he'd hoped television coverage would promote his scheme to turn Featherstone Hall into a rehabilitation centre for returning soldiers; a service he was determined to expand throughout the country. But the reporter was only interested in graphic stories of heroics, with plenty of blood and gore, she told him. He'd flinched at that, and when she'd added that sort ofstuffworked miracles for the ratings he'd felt like telling her it was lucky for her she wasn't a man, or he'd have invited her outside. Grinding his jaw as he waited for the camera crew to pack up their gear, he knew he shouldn't blame the reporter. He should be glad she was ignorant of what he had been through and was spared the reality behind the images on her television screen.As soon as the last of them had gone he set about clearing up, and had no sooner piled their dirty coffee-cups into an already overloaded sink than the whole stack keeled over. He swore viciously, having cut himself on a piece of shattered china. And now the cut wouldn't stop bleeding…He banged about, searching for plasters. How could a home turn to chaos in the time he'd been away? The first housekeeper he'd hired to take care of things had appeared tough and uncompromising. Just the sort of person he could relate to, in fact. He should have known a black belt in karate and more stubble on her chin than he had was no guarantee of domestic goddess status—and to add insult to injury she'd walked out the day after he got back saying he was impossible to live with.And now there hadn't been a single reply to his ad for a replacement. The reporter said his reputation must have frightened everyone away. That and his appearance, he guessed, judging by the way the camera crew had stared at his scars. He suspected they would have liked more close-ups to shock the viewers. Fingering his stubble, he glanced in the mirror. He couldn't blame them.And he hardly had the temperament of a saint, Cade registered grimly, cursing a second time when he scalded his wounded hand trying to rescue a second piece of shattered pottery from the sink. He was in a foul mood now.Hearing a knock on the door ratcheted it up a notch or two. He might have known someone from the film crew would forget something.'Yes?' He flung the door wide. And was forced to adjust his eye line radically down to where a small bedraggled wretch stood on his doorstep wearing some type of fancy dress.'Can I come in?' she said.He took everything in at a glance. Something inside him stirred, which required stamping on, plus a stern reminder that appearances could be deceptive. The girl was young with honey-coloured hair hanging in drenched straggles around a heart-shaped face. She wore a tiara, tilted at a precarious angle on her head, and her silk shoes were ruined. What appeared to be a bridal gown and veil were ripped and streaked with mud… and now he could see she'd been crying—whether from relief or grief, he couldn't know. But one thing he did know—this was not fancy dress. 'What do you want?' he asked suspiciously.'The job you advertised… The notice on the gate?'Standing back, he thumbed his stubble. He needed someone, and quickly. But first he had to make sure he'd got this right. He raised his brow as he looked the girl over a second time. 'You are applying for the job as my housekeeper?''I know this doesn't look good,' she said, mashing her lips together as she struggled to convince him. 'And of course I would have preferred to make a proper application wearing a suit—''But?''But events overtook me.'Talk about understatement. But she held his gaze steadily enough, and this was hardly a high-risk situation. 'Okay, you can come in.''Do you mind if I get warm?' she said, walking straight past him to hold her hands in front of the blazing log fire.'Go right ahead.' It was a reasonable request, and she was shaking—with cold or shock, he couldn't tell. He closed the door and turned back to find her unpinning her veil. Her pale arms glowed pink in the firelight, adding to her air of vulnerability. Where there had been anger and impatience and frustration in his head, now there was only curiosity and more than a flicker of inconvenient desire.Between the flight from her wedding and her arrival here, in the kitchen at Featherstone Hall, everything was a horrible blur—up to now when it had snapped into sharp focus. Her senses were on full alert. And it was all thanks to the man resting against the door with his arms folded and his head tipped back, weighing her up. The power of his gaze, the spread of his shoulders, even his stillness, were arresting. When she had stumbled off the bus and found the notice on the gates advertising the post of housekeeper she had pictured some elderly retainer conducting the interview—not a hunk in jeans and a snug-fitting top with dog tags swinging round his neck. This man was as different from poor Horace—the almost-husband she had left at the altar—as it was possible to be. Stifling a guilty sob as she thought about the look on Horace's face when she had bolted, Liv started to tug at the wedding dress she didn't deserve to wear.'What do you think you're doing?''Taking it off…' The man's voice was low and husky, and had done things to her insides that should be forbidden by law; things that stirred the guilt inside her to the point where she had to confess. 'I've done something terrible.''Robbed a bank? Killed someone?''Worse.''Worse?''Really, I have… And now I can't go back.''That bad?' He thumbed his stubble once again.'Can I stay here?'As her lips trembled and her eyes filled with tears he knew he had to forget the attraction element and concentrate on getting to the bottom of this. 'I think we'd better start with introductions, don't you?''LivTate,' she mumbled. After some hesitation she gathered herself enough to extend a soft, perfectly manicured hand and add, 'My first name is Olivia, but my friends call me Liv.'He went into the handshake with his unwounded right hand. Considering her obvious distress, the strength in Liv's grip surprised him. He released her before any more concerning sensations could get a hold of him.'I've told you my name,' she reminded him, 'but as yet I don't know yours…''My apologies for the omission.' He made her a slight bow. 'Lieutenant Colonel Cade Grant… But you can call me Cade.''Cade…'When their hands connected he felt a jolt, an unwelcome jolt that reminded him why he stayed away from people—and women like this one, especially. He shunned feelings. All feelings. All the time. 'Something wrong?' he demanded when she continued to stare at him.'My turn to apologise. I was just surprised to hear your name. I didn't connect it when I saw the family crest on the top of your notice because that said Grant Featherstone Carew.''Just imagine signing for a parcel.'The look of irony in his eyes made her laugh. It also jolted a primitive urge inside her that made her gasp when she recognised it as instant, potent, dazzling lust. And now she couldn't have been angrier with herself for the lapse in concentration. She recovered herself to say primly, 'Yes, I can see why you might shorten it.'Lieutenant Colonel Cade Grant, local war hero? How slow was she? Bolting from her own wedding must have scrambled her brain. You could hardly pick up a newspaper or switch on the television without there being some report about Cade Grant's bravery under fire. The reasons for his extended leave might have been vague, but no one questioned a hero's right to some R and R. 'Of course I've heard of you—who hasn't? And I know I shouldn't stare—'At what?' he demanded. 'The scars?' His mood took a dive as he fingered his face.'Scars?' Her brow puckered and then her eyes cleared as she focused on them. 'Sorry again, I hadn't noticed them. I was just thinking how much better looking you are in the flesh than on the television—' She gulped, went bright red and pressed her lips together as if she didn't trust herself to speak another word.Surprising himself, he badly wanted to smile.Starting to fumble with the tiny buttons on the back of her dress, she angled her back towards him. 'Could you help me with this, please?'He hesitated, and then thought, Why not?She felt Cade move behind her on silent feet like a big cat. His warmth surrounded her, sending tingles of sensation down her spine. She could smell his scent, clean and musky with a hint of toothpaste in the mix. She held her breath as he reached out and touched her.'This terrible thing you did… Are yo...", "related": ["B00JGABO14"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When we first meet Tickle, she is a highly imaginative only child growing up in the mountains of eastern Tennessee in the 1930s. By the  end of the book we have followed her through the formative days of college,  her migration into the Episcopal Church, and into some of her most riveting  moments as a young wife and public school teacher in the 1950s.Tickle has the wisdom of a mature storyteller as well as the humility of a  spiritual seeker. She makes meaning out of the smallest details, showing  us how a backyard forsythia bush became a sacred hiding place,  foreshadowing her lifelong compulsion to find private sanctuaries. We meet  her gentle mother, who made a daily ritual out of reading a magazine,  manicuring her nails and studying the Bible. This, she concludes,  influenced Tickle's adult attraction to the daily psalms. Even the way she  sneaked cigarettes in her college dorm offers insight into the nature of  her Christian yearnings.Some of her scenes are utterly gripping, like her near-death experience  after having an adverse reaction to an anti-miscarriage drug. \"Without a  care for anything that had ever been or ever was or ever might be, I lifted  toward the light as lithely as if I had been a sparrow upon the courses of  the early morning wind.\" Throughout the memoir we are held in this kind of  lilting narration. Like a feminine version of Pat Conroy, Tickle is a  strong, descriptive author who thoroughly appreciates how Southern  landscapes, family, marriage, and death can shape a character as well as a  spirit.--Gail Hudson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother, to help Beauty fare better at school, attempts to make cookies for the class with disastrous results. Still, she keeps trying, and cookie baking becomes their special time together. As Beauty's birthday approaches, her father plans an extravagant celebration with all of her classmates, even those who torment her daily. The event is a disaster. Later, when Mr. Cookson lets loose the rabbit that Beauty received as a gift from the one girl who befriends her and it gets killed, she and her mother leave him. With the help of new friends, the two finally feel safe and discover just how strong—and beautiful—they are.

Great as a reference for Church/FHE lessons.\n\nAwesome for all ages, January 15, 2008\nBy Eric\n\nI had the great opportunity of hearing Brother McKenzie speak at EFY two years ago. He spoke on the subject of the Second Coming and used many quotes and examples from his book, which I had read shortly before. This is an amazing book that has helped me understand the Second Coming and be more able to explain it to others, members or otherwise. I highly recommend this to anyone of any age.

This handy manual is engagingly, effectively and informally written to serve as a guide to becoming an effective group member.James Trotzer, PhD, BEHS Resource Faculty, Granite State CollegeThis book recaptures the lost art of acknowledging that the self is the primary tool of the counselor. By relating the exploration of self to one’s growth as a group leader, this book provides an excellent resource for counselor training.  Kevin A. Fall, PhD, Associate Professor of Counseling, Texas State UniversityBoth prospective participants and current students can gain an insider’s look at group counseling from this book…It uses rich, descriptive and continuing group scenarios to cogently illustrate essential group development and processes. In addition, the book’s grounding in multicultural contexts and theory set it apart as a book for its time.Robert K. Conyne, PhD, Professor Emeritus, University of CincinnatiShakoor appears to be a seasoned worker with much experience. He demonstrates an ability to simplify complex concepts. This is evident in the graceful language he uses to describe facets of the group experience...the drama of the fictitious group is compelling, and the author's descriptions of psychological concepts are pertinent to social group workers. The book's strength lies in the author's use of language, especially when discussing aspects of self-awareness.Keren Ludwig,Social Work with Groups", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While her grades might have suffered, her imagination seldom did.She managed to keep most of her stories together for years, then lost them after a move when she left a trunk full of papers behind. (She meant to go back and get them, but circumstances prevented her from doing so.) So, she started over again.And lost those, too.After a trip to England in 2002, she began work on A Marginal Life (Well-Lived), inspired by the music of Jarvis Cocker and Pulp. The novel was completed in 2003, and is undergoing rewrites with hopes of publication in the near future.Also in 2003, she met and fell in love with an Italian accountant named Alessandro. She married him in 2004. This necessitated her arrival in Italy and she has lived there ever since. After several months of working for language schools and writing blog entries for her family in the US to read, new story ideas began to develop.Finally, in 2007, she began work on a new project, inspired by her love/hate relationship with her new home. The novel Ask Me if I'm Happy was completed in 2009. The novel was released November 15th, 2010, and Kimberly is presently at work on her next project, 27 Stages.On April 28th, 2011, Kimberly published a novella, \"Alternate Rialto\", which is a prequel to Ask Me if I'm Happy.", "related": [], "rank": 3686442, "title": "Alternate Rialto (Italian Connections) eBook", "author": "Kimberly Menozzi", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Accessible, informative, and authoritative, it packs into its small size an amazing amount of information, not only about the literature of the Old Testament and its cultural and historical context, but also about the methods of biblical scholarship that revolutionized the understanding of the Old Testament during the last two centuries. It is an ideal introduction for a wide range of readers: the non-religious who are curious about this cultural monument, Jews and Christians who want an orientation to their complex scriptures, and students seeking an overview of the Old Testament in critical perspective.\"--Carol Newsom, Candler Professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, Emory University\"Marked by an astonishing comprehensiveness, this book presents established facts and contested issues alike with irenic clarity. Balancing panoramic views with deeper exegetical probes, Coogan deftly interweaves insights gleaned from Canaanite, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian texts, archaeology, reception history from Ben Sira to Luther to Kierkegaard, and contemporary feminist criticism. The result is a compelling invitation to readers who seek to understand the ancient sociopolitical conflicts, rituals, and theologies that animate the Old Testament.\"--Carolyn Sharp, Associate Professor of Hebrew Scriptures, Yale Divinity School", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Part biblio-mystery, part tragedy and all brilliant, Padura's follow-up to his Havana Quartet (Havana Gold, etc.) finds Mario Conde 14 years after retiring from the police force pursuing books instead of criminals, acting as a book scout to earn enough for food and drink. His famed intuition leads him to a decrepit mansion, its old and odd inhabitants, and to the most impressive private library ever assembled in Cuba, untouched for 43 years. Stuck in between a book's pages, he discovers a 1960 magazine photo of a sultry singer, Violeta del Río, who disappeared in the 1950s. Conde's curiosity turns to obsession as he tries to unravel Violeta's sad fate. The trail takes Conde into the past when Batista ruled, revolution was near and gangsters like Meyer Lansky oversaw casinos, clubs and brothels. It will also take him into the most dangerous and terrible of Havana's barrios. The glory of Cuba's biblio-history drives this exceptional novel.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Most of her books are much longer and the main\ncharacters are elves but in this children's book, Emerine's Nightmare,\nshe focuses on the fairy folk. Twelve-year-old Emerine and his father\ncame home from fishing to find his mother murdered and their home\nburned. His father warned him that the shadows were hunting him and that\n he must find the fairy folk. As they rushed to escape, his father was\nconstantly aware of the danger. When they attacked, Emerine's father\npushed him inside the trunk of a tree. Emerine could do nothing but\nwatch as the shadows murdered his father. Emerine must continue on his\nown as he searches for the Fairy Queen and tries to elude the shadows.In\n Emerine's Nightmare, the author has allowed her imagination to rule.\nThis children's book is a mere forty-seven pages but don't let that fool\n you: the story is not small. The plot is good versus evil but is not so\n dark that it will overwhelm children. The illustrations are beautifully\n done. I knew from previous books that Anna Del C. Dye was a talented\nauthor but I had no idea she was also a talented illustrator. My one\nsuggestion concerns the illustrations. I would like to see more of them\nand perhaps a wee bit of color added. The characters are interesting.\nChildren will particularly identify with Emerine because of his age and\nhis uncertainty over whom to trust. This book will appeal to children 9\nthrough 15.", "related": [], "rank": 4575921, "title": "Emerine's Nightmare eBook", "author": "Anna del C.

He was also an attending surgeon at Bellevue Hospital. As a full professor at the NYU Medical School, he taught surgery and anatomy.  After college, Dick Kessler spent a post-graduate year studying anatomy at the University of Toronto with Dr. J.C. Boileau Grant, a leading 20th Century anatomists whose \"Grant’s Atlas of Anatomy\" is still a required text. Upon entering the medical school of McGill University in Montreal, he was asked to teach anatomy to his classmates because of his 400 hours of instruction from Dr. Grant. Though retired from the practice of medicine, he still teaches anatomy to first-year medical students at NYU.  During his career, Dr. Kessler published 60 articles and abstracts in peer review journals, but he wanted this book to be read by people with no medical training. \"Because of the confusion caused by the on-going debate about health care reform,\" he told his co-author, “I feel an obligation to tell what I have seen, heard, and learned first-hand over half-a-century as a medical student, an intern, a resident, a practicing physician, a general surgeon, a U.S. Army doctor, a teacher, a researcher and an expert witness in medical malpractice law suits.”  Co-author PATRICK TRESE has been writing professionally since college, mostly network news and documentaries for NBC News where he learned to translate complicated legal, political and scientific language into plain, readable English. During his 30 years at NBC, his writing and producing awards included a Peabody and several Emmys. His book about covering DEEP FREEZE II & III in Antarctica, \"Penguins Have Square Eyes\", was published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1962. Caril, the story of Caril Ann Fugate, who became involved with mass-murderer Charles Starkweather and was convicted of first degree murder at age 15, was published by Lippincott in 1972. It was based on his NBC News documentary \"Growing Up in Prison.\" He will soon publish a novel, \"AMDG: An Ignatian Thriller\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It isn't very often that a book with less then 20 pages, that isn't a children's book, really grabs my attention and ends up being one of the most original stories I ever read.My only complaint would be that I would love an actual mini series or possibly a new book with a lot more pages! This has a lot of potential to be a super mystery, detective, science fiction, and everything in between, novel. It amazes me that this author was able to create such a unique story, (this is something you don't see so often anymore), and introduce so many characters, give short descriptions of backgrounds, the plot, thoroughly explain what is happening, answer your questions, and deliver such a magnificent ending, in less then 20 pages. I am a big horror, action, science fiction, creepy, mystery, crime, fan, and I read and watch a ton in this genre. This is truly something that had me on edge and dreading the little arrows on the bottom of the screen when I saw I hit the double digits. I recommend this book to all scifi fans, any fans of The Twilight Zone, and please, if we get enough people to read and post their thoughts, maybe we can persuade the author to give us more!\"Brandy Oliver, Busy Mommy List Blog", "related": [], "rank": 1579314, "title": "The Unfinished - Current Edition", "author": "Patrice Williams Marks", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.3125, "rating_total": 69.0}

A single line of blood dripped\nfrom the side of her mouth and down her chin as she carelessly dropped her\nvictim's body on the floor. Rebecca hissed at Anasytázia annoyed at herself for\nnot completing her task, then ran to her, kissing her hand in respect to being\nthe alpha then licked the blood drip that was just about to fall from her face.", "related": [], "rank": 1251232, "title": "Vampire Changeling", "author": "Shiralyn J.

She learned in her youth the power of imagination, while being raised on the plains, five miles from the nearest town. Spending days playing with her cousins and brother in games of imagination and invention, M C got her first taste of creating lands of make believe. When adulthood took its grip on her life, she traveled all over the country and learned lots about her fellow human counterparts. With the desire to create those make believe lands again, M C decided to try her hand at script writing, but something wasn't quite right. So after several years, she decided to write her first book. The young adult fantasy genre called her name.MC had this to say about herself:\"I guess you could say I have the personality of a fourteen year old video gaming, fantasy fiction reading, math loving nerd girl. I got my glasses when I was nine, had an Atari growing up, and loved reading. I grew up in West Texas, in the country, five miles from a town with only four thousand people in it. I have one brother but a lot of cousins, and we grew up together. I'm the oldest, and therefore the bossiest, so I used to make up games and adventures for us. That's really were I got my start with creating imaginary worlds. The adventure always called to me, so I moved around a lot as an adult, seeing lots of different parts of the US. I think I was looking for the inspiration for those imaginary worlds, or the imaginary worlds themselves. I finally ended up in Southern California, with a fantastic job in a library. That's when I started throwing book ideas around, it all started making sense, I needed to write.I think I always wanted to write, I just couldn't find out where I was supposed to be, what genre. I think that the young adult fantasy genre is where I'll probably write most of my books. That is where the Atari loving 14 year old nerd girl belongs.\"", "related": ["B00GVKMCOK"], "rank": 1406697, "title": "Aquanis (Trefoil Trilogy Book 2) eBook", "author": "M C Moore", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He became Asia's first Nobel laureate when he won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature. A Pirali Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta, Tagore first wrote poems at the age of eight. At the age of sixteen, he published his first substantial poetry under the pseudonym Bhanushingho (\"Sun Lion\") and wrote his first short stories and dramas in 1877. His home schooling, life in Shilaidaha, and travels made Tagore a nonconformist and pragmatist. Tagore strongly protested against the British Raj and gave his support to the Indian Independence Movement and Mahatma Gandhi. Tagore's life was tragic-he lost virtually his entire family and was devastated to witness Bengal's decline-but his life's work endured, in the form of his poetry and the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University. Tagore wrote novels, short stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays on political and personal topics. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced), and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are among his best-known works. His verse, short stories, and novels, which often exhibited rhythmic lyricism, colloquial language, meditative naturalism, and philosophical contemplation, received worldwide acclaim. Tagore was also a cultural reformer and polymath who modernised Bengali art by rejecting strictures binding it to classical Indian forms. Two songs from his rabindrasangeet canon are now the national anthems of Bangladesh and India: the Amar Shonar Bangla and the Jana Gana Mana.\" (Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

July 1945) and Barbara Faye (Herrin) Burkhalter (b. July 1948). Her only sibling is Charlotte Faye Henley (b. May 1964). As a child, she lived in Dallas, Miami, and New Orleans, finally settling in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, at the age of eight. She lived in Hattiesburg through high school and chose to travel in lieu of attending college.  After traveling for over two years living in places such as Pensacola Beach, Florida, Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Los Angeles, California, she moved back to her home state of Mississippi. She then began to attend college, majoring in Accounting. She and her first husband William Horne (b. March 1965 d.Oct. 2010), met through mutual friends and were married in July 1993. While living in Hattiesburg, she wrote many award winning poems and began to write short stories. She worked a variety of jobs over the next several years including insurance sales, retail sales, and started her own skin care business. After the death of her first son, Andrew Horne (d. 1997), she became a homemaker and began to explore different genres of writing. She continued her first love, poetry and began writing longer short stories and screenplays. She wrote the first of her three novels, The Letter in 1999, over a period of six weeks. Within a year, she had a literary agent and her work was presented to major publishers, though it wasn't published. She remarried in 2003 and her first daughter, Maria, was born in May 2004. During this time she wrote two collections of poetry and one children's book. After her daughter began attending school, she reread The Letter. Pushing aside all normal paths of publishing, she chose to self-publish through the median of e-books and in paperback through CreateSpace.  Her ancestry is German and American Indian. Charna is an avid reader, usually reading 2 to 4 books at one time. She is currently taking on-line classes through The University of Southern Mississippi and attends church regularly at The Church of God in Purvis with her daughter, Maria. She also contributes to a variety of local charities in her community.  Charna Ainsworth lives in Mississippi with her young daughter and their dog and cat, Lakota and Buddy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although pursuing accounting as a career path, I have always had a great interest in creative writing. I have written more than 200 songs, writing both the music and/or lyrics and collaborating with numerous writers and musicians through the years. I signed 39 publishing agreements with a host of publishers and almost realized a cut on Vanessa Williams' \"Sweetest Days\" album; however, 39 times my dreams did not come to fruition. I have written many poems and short stories and one screenplay.  I love movies and had seen over 1,500 by the age of 13 when there was snow on 13 channels after midnight. I have always enjoyed horror and from an early age wrote numerous short stories in that genre. Some of those early stories are in my first book entitled \"Black As Night. My favorite horror movies are Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, and the Evil Dead. My favorite movie of all time Is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life with James Stewart. My favorite authors are Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, John Sandford, Michael Connelly, Robert B. Parker , Clive Cusler, James Patterson, Jeffery Deaver, Dean Koontz, Edgar Allen Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, James Lee Burke and Richard Matheson.", "related": ["B00HY09JPQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They\nare good friends and give unerring loyalty to each other, no matter the\noutcome. Pris, Elizabeth, Pat, and Anita are good friends. They have\nexperienced some mighty challenges throughout their lives, not least of\nwhich has been rejection. They have loved and been loved, but\nultimately, have also been discarded. Pris is an endearing 'never give\nup' kind of individual, despite losing men that she thought would be\n'forever' in her life. She is determined to succeed, with or without\nmale support. Her story is encouraging and gutsy. She deserves the\nresults she gets after taking enormous risks.The women handle their own\ndifferences with aplomb, taking one day at a time and are always\nsupportive and caring of their girl-friends, no matter what the problem\nmight be. Men come and go in their lives. Some are not worthy of\nattention or the girls' love; however, meeting and knowing are very\ndifferent. Once particular characteristics are exposed, they are better\nleft behind.The book gives an overview of good friendship, of loyalty and\nunconditional support, and I could not help but feel connected to each lady as her\nlife was revealed. My values differ greatly to those detailed in the\nbook. However, I had empathy in each situation, despite not altogether\nagreeing. If you don't mind adult language and situations, then In\nCrooked Paths by Barb McIntyre book is an entertaining read.", "related": [], "rank": 4695908, "title": "Crooked Paths", "author": "Barb McIntyre", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A must-read for anyone tired of the abstract and sober nature of Y2K.\" --Westergaard Year 2000 Online, Y2K Book Center, July 15, 1999\"If you want to take your mind off of Y2k, but not too far off, get a copy of Nancy McKibben's novel, The Chaos Protocol. Using the knowledge of Y2k gleaned from this list and many other on- and offline sources, McKibben weaves an exciting tale of what might happen if Y2k is crossed with an attempt to insert into the world's banking system a worm that will extract huge sums and wreck the global economy.  McKibben cleverly uses her knowledge of Y2k and large computer systems to tell a credible story of potential technical disaster. But this is not just a technical manual disguised as a novel. McKibben enlivens the story with the very human accounts of the people who must find the worm and stop it from creating chaos. The Y2k deadline drives the pacing of the book, which makes for compelling reading.\" (Norman Kurland, moderator for the CPSR (Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility) email list) --Norman Kurland, moderator for the CPSR, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, email list\"The Chaos Protocol is a tautly written, highly recommended thriller right out of today's headlines.\"  --The Midwest Book Review\"What a great book! It brings new meaning to the phrase \"losing sleep over Y2K\"-you'll stay up 'til all hours reading this suspenseful book!  McKibben knows people and tells a gripping story with Tom Clancy thoroughness. Techies will recognize themselves in this book. And the book will energize them to power through the last few months of this year. It's a real tribute to all the techies working around the world on Y2K.\"  --PJ Wylie, Y2K computer consultant and author of Power Your Way Through Y2K\"Who can say what will really happen around the world when clocks strike 2000?  In this fast-paced thriller, McKibben finally writes flesh onto a topic that has remained all too abstract, showing us what can (or will?) happen when the unscrupulous look at our latest man-made disaster and see only opportunity.  A thought-provoking read.\"  --Louise Vetter, co-author of the Alison Glen MysteriesAn exciting novel that weaves a web of international intrigue around one of the central issues of our time  the Y2K problem  while showing us the vulnerability of our computer systems to malicious hackers and economic espionage.  McKibben blends a clever mix of credible fact and suspenseful fiction in this captivating tale of a marauding computer worm and the dedicated team seeking to disable it.

She labors to find what makes them tick and how to reach what motivates their need for her. What is striking is her compassion for the majority of them. Also interesting is her reaction to her co-workers: she too is curious, reassured by them and at times just as fascinated by them as we are.The narrator is as much business woman as she is New Age Goddess. Her involvement in escort work is as much about self-determination as it is about meeting practical needs, like the costs of her home and her caretaking of another.Apart from the content, the style of the writing is compelling enough to make you read the book in one sitting and then read it again.\" - Jennifer Burke, Author\"Tara Burns gets right to the raw truth of the matter, capturing the humanity of her coworkers and clients without making caricatures of them like so many writers do.

When they were launched into this great trial and did not know what the outcome would look like one thing they did know was that they were not alone. God has shown Himself to be faithful in so many different ways. He has strengthened their faith in taking Him at His Word.

MJ Wayland’s interest in the paranormal, especially ghosts, began at an early age after experiencing a number of unusual incidents that his peers could not explain. In his early teens he joined various research societies and began to study the multiple facets to the paranormal with a scientific and historical viewpoint.  His research has taken him from dark haunted castles of Britain to the haunted graveyards of New Orleans, investigating his primary love of ghosts to sightings of black panthers. Since the mid-1990s, MJ Wayland has provided consultancy for TV, film and theatre as well as appearing in local, national, international newspapers, radio and TV.  He is the author of eight best-selling books, “50 Real Ghost Stories” holding the Amazon top 10 bestselling Paranormal book for the second consecutive Halloween in 2013.

He spent 4 1/2 years in Asia working as an English teacher in Taiwan. He met his wife Chien Yu (Christy) while working for Hess Language School in Hsinchu. His experiences in Taiwan were documented in his first book, \"An American Teacher in Taiwan.\" Ken moved his family to Austin, Texas in 2008, and his struggles and successes were documented in his second book, \"From Taiwan to Texas: Life in Mid-America.\" His third book, \"The Reluctant Austinite,\" is the third and final book in a trilogy of memoirs & anecdotes about life in America and Taiwan. His first fiction book, \"Interstate 10\", was released in January of 2013 to very positive reviews. He followed up that book with another fiction book, \"Small Town Evil\", in February 2013. \"Small Town Evil\" became a massive hit and went on to become a best-seller in the Horror genre, selling thousands of copies and staying in the top 50 for almost a year, and reaching as high as #3, at one point only being outsold by veteran horror writers Stephen King and Anne Rice. \"The Dead Ones\" was released in April of 2013. Ken described it as \"sort of a companion piece to 'Interstate 10.' If people liked that one, they will probably like this one too.\" \"Four Bites\", an anthology of 4 horror stories both new and old, was released in November, 2013.

But there is so much more to the experience than the clichés offer; other things that happen, other places in the girls' minds that need to be explored. I go with my girls to those other places.

Overly rigorous training methods and a couple of accidents led to multiple surgeries, polyarthritis, and a period of almost total inactivity that lasted years. Determined to recover his health and at least a portion of his previous lifestyle, he hit upon the idea of combining and adapting various post-op and physical therapy exercises into a workout program.  Since all these were non-destructive and designed to speed recovery, he reasoned that they should be suitable for literally anyone. Those returning to sports after long layoffs or recovering from injuries will especially benefit from these non-destructive, zero-impact exercises, which proved their worth by allowing the author to get back in shape and back into surfing after a forced layoff of several years.

One of my favourite things in school was when the teacher gave us free rein to write a fiction story of our choice, I actually found one of these that I'd received an A* for in my old student record of achievement file. It was strange reading it back, ten pages of A4 painfully scripted by hand in fountain pen. I am only thirty four years of age and ball point had obviously been invented, so god knows why I slogged it out in fountain pen, but I did. After school my writing literally stopped, I got caught up with other things that people in their late teens enjoy, mainly partying and getting drunk if I remember correctly, and working to pay for the aforementioned activities.  Even in the sixteen years' gap between that last hand scribed story I found and the publishing of Watchers, I tried many times to start a book. Sadly any project I tried never got past the first three chapters. I even started writing Watchers in 2004, shortly after meeting my long term partner and now fiancée, Laura. The start was a little different but the character names and general plot were the same, and that's how it began. Although at that point I did not get past chapter two. Whilst I'd often think up cool or quirky ideas for stories I'd never get round to writing, Watchers would not go away. For near on ten years it remained where I thought it always would, in my head. Then as the indie book began to take hold I saw my chance to get this story out there, now all I had to do was actually write the thing. I penned the first two chapters and let a friend read them, asking for an honest review, when she literally demanded I carry on writing it so she could see the story unfold I knew it was now or never, and after nearly a year's research and writing I finally finished the book, even leaving it open enough for a follow up novel if the story obtained some good reviews, which it did. So, being a glutton for punishment and still not quite able to believe that I'd written a novel length story, I started book two. My plans were to have it written and published by now, but we had a pretty shitty 2013 with a number of close family deaths, this saw the writing of book two well and truly put on hold. Thankfully, we did have one ray of light in that dark year: my son Finley was born in January. Whilst being great fun and now a year old, he certainly does not give me much time to put finger to keyboard. SB", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 211351, "title": "Watchers", "author": "S.T.

During this time I had the privilege of travelling throughout Zimbabwe and the surrounding countries such as Mozambique, Zambia and South Africa where I experienced firsthand much of that described in the publication.  As a senior manager of a multinational company I was involved in many development programmes from supplying solar power and communications to rural clinics to installing equipment in some of the deepest mines in the region and it left me with an incredible sense of fulfilment. My broad exposure to this beautiful country allowed me to live life to the full and this story has always been in my heart to write.  Married with two children I moved to the UK in 2000 where I am the owner of a telecommunications company; however the heartbeat of Africa will always be with me.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's\nbeen a life changing accomplishment for me. So far, the judgements have\nbeen very kind and encouraging.     I call myself The River Lady. My\n husband, Steve, and Icurrently live on a river in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, where together we greet every new day as an exciting, fresh\n adventure in the beauty of life!We go with the flow...     I've\n enjoyed wearing many hats; published\nfreelance writer, designer, photographer, 3-D stained glass sculpture\nand jewelry artist, licensed massage therapist, Reiki Master...and more! I love so many things!!!Everyone\n said that I needed to choose one thing and stick to it...Hmmm.    In\n May of 2012, after a brief stay-cation/journey to my soul adventure to determine where I was\n headed and why,(which I undertook on the brink of turning 58),I\nfinally decided to do just that, but I couldn't decide between my two favorites, writing and\nphotography... so I chose both!I\n utilize my nature photos as backgrounds for my inspirational musings\nand meanderings. I've even coined a term for\nthem -Prose-ography!     Listening to a variety of people has helped me to understand that there are many out there who seek inspiration; they want\nproducts that help them to encourage others, and they want help\nexpressing their own feelings. I love fulfilling that need!My bookmarks, greeting cards and prints help the process wonderfully.    My\n love for creative writing and photography continually grows\ninside of me, motivating me to inspire myself and the world around me.

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Upon arriving at the guardrail where many onlookers gather, the most brilliant white light flooded the vehicle, leaving Kathleen and her friends stunned. Within seconds, it vanished. The most confounding thing about the Light was that those standing near the guardrail had not witnessed anything at all. In a way, the Light was an illusion. Young and old gather year round because there is indeed something peculiar and mesmerizing about this phenomenon that is said to grace these parts for over one hundred years. In her many trips to see the Light over the years, she has spoken with onlookers who have traveled from all over the country to witness Paulding Light and its mysteries. Paulding Light was featured in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries as well as Ripley’s Believe It or Not.

Ressa does not flinch in describing the ordeal her co-workers experienced, her role in freeing them or issuing a clarion call to us to be aware of the danger we face from Internet-connected terrorists. Her work is a critical literary experience for us all.\"-- Harry K Thomas, Jr, US Ambassador to the Philippines and former Director for South Asia, National Security Council\"Maria Ressa wrote the first book on the rise of terrorism in Southeast Asia. In the last decade, concerted intelligence, law enforcement and military operations have disrupted international, regional and domestic threat groups in Southeast Asia. Maria captures these emerging developments in From bin Laden to Facebook, a must-read for policy and decision makers, security practitioners and scholars, as well as the public.\"--Rohan Gunaratna, Head, International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies\"One of the leading experts on terror in Southeast Asia, Maria Ressa has written a fascinating and important primer on the ties of family and loyalty that bind the region's Islamist networks. Rich with the personal histories of some of the region's most dangerous men and women, her account is framed by the gripping step-by-step drama of a kidnapping that brought terror to her doorstep in what she calls 'the most challenging ten days of my life'.\"--Seth Mydans, Former New York Times Correspondent", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lockwood is the pseudonym for my sister and I.  We love to read and especially write books with an unusual twist.  We are using the name Dreamah H. Lockwood as a memorial to our sister who died in 2012.  We have been writing as a team for several years and A CIRCLE OF MURDERS is our first work submitted for e-publishing.  Please read this book and give it an honest review at Amazon.com.  We would appreciate your feedback. Our novels are romantic suspense.  CREATING KATHRYN CROWN is our latest book which is also available on amazon.com.  Sometimes the paranormal creeps into our story as with the current book we are writing, THE STONE KILLER.  This story has a serial killer and a ghost.  We hope to have THE STONE KILLER available the first part of 2014.  Look for it.  In the meantime, give our other novels a read.  We love to write and hope to produce two or more novels a year.  We will certainly try. Most of our time is devoted to writing and family.  My sister is married to a wonderful man and has children, plus three dogs.  I only have my three four-legged furry cats to keep me busy.  Needless to say, we are great animal lovers.  My sister lives in Kentucky, and I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

While I prefer to admire the Mackinaw Bridge from the lower peninsula (aka: The Mitton) to traveling across it, the area is one of my favorites in the state. So when the first spark of an idea for Laying Low in Paradise started to grow, I knew that's where I wanted it to take place.At first I'd thought to use Mackinaw Island, the setting for the Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour flick, Somewhere in Time, but changed my mind when I realized I needed the location to be a little more isolated...so I chose Bois Blanc Island instead.And that's when the magic started to happen. I fell in love with the characters - even Finn and Nolan who, in the outline, had fairly small roles. Now it looks as though they'll each get their own books in the Casteloria series. But writing about Cameron and Laura was a pure joy, and I hope you enjoy reading their story as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 10448, "title": "A Prince on the Run: The Casteloria Royals (The Casteloria Series Book 1)", "author": "Kristy K.

One of my friend\nrecommend this book to me, and I decided to give it a go. Its a very well written step by step guide. The most\nimportant thing is (compared to other guides) the facts/requirements are up to\ndate. I know I have to deal with so many thing, moving, visas, find a home,\nwork, etc... but with the help of this guide its much easier. I have few friend who were trying to go to Canada, but they\neither paid huge fees or failed, as they didn't plan well ahead and they didn't\nknow the necessary information. Hopefully I will be there by end of this year.\nThanks to this book, i know what I have to expect, and how to prepare.Very well written.

If the tribulation occurs, most of the world's civilian population would be exterminated, preparing the way for the Antichrist.\"Throughout the story, several prophecies are intricately woven. The politics of socialism are demonized, literally. And the final unity of the Church is accomplished, with Russia emerging as central to Christendom's final stage.\"This book will appeal to a wide, general audience, because even if you're not Christian, the possibility of the world's ruling elites getting together and coordinating a global EMP attack that would wipe out 70 or 80% or more of the little people, like you and me, is a very real possibility.

This isn't a dating agency, and doesn't really have much impact on whether you want to read my stories. I do tell you this so you know I am not a fantasising schoolboy with no life experience, and to forewarn American readers that there may be some bits you don't get immediately - hell, if I have to read your authors saying about male characters getting their pants off and realise they do still have underwear on (possibly) then you can read about mine having sex in a lift (elevator) or having a faint smell of petrol (gas). I am also bisexual. This doesn't mean all my stories are; quite the opposite, it means my stories might be straight, gay or bi. I don't believe in tricking people - I clearly state what to expect. You can expect a wide variety of erotic tales, covering heterosexual and gay, straight and fetish. Rest assured though, they all come from the heart (or somewhere lower) and are all written to stimulate. With such a wide variety, I recognise that not all will suit everybody. I only want you shocked if you want to be, and surprised by any twists, not the content. So, apart from clear labelling that these stories will be explicit, they will also be colour coded, green, amber or... pink. Green erotica = straight; Amber erotica = a bit more kinky, fetish-based; Pink erotica = lesbian, gay, bi. Thus taking an example story, a couple having just had a candlelit dinner at home when the mood overcomes them. In green, the man pushes the plates to one side and lifts the woman onto the table, taking her there. In amber, he might not move the plates and they have sex among the dinner, licking it off one another and using items. In pink, it might be two men or two women, or the man discovers the 'woman' is really a man but continues anyway. Wet your appetite?

Over that period, I've endured varied reactions from others when responding to the mundane question, \"What do you do for a living?\" The reaction I used to receive was a glance over my shoulder that told me they wanted to find someone more remarkable to speak with. Like an accountant, for instance. But since the '08 financial meltdown and the (well-deserved) scorn my banking brethren have engendered, the reaction has been much more interesting.I've found that bankers have replaced lawyers as the scapegoats for all things reprehensible in current economics. The old stereotype of the balding, vested, overweight, cigar-smoking desk jockey has been replaced by the image of a modern robber-baron intent not only on capitalizing on the efforts of others, but on ripping off the populace through taxpayer-sponsored bailouts.It was these experiences that led me to write Cash Burn. The contempt for bankers. The uncertainty in the economy. The mismanagement of insured institutions. The politics played within organizations. And the potential for circumvention of the internal controls that banks as regulated entities are supposed to structure so carefully. In Cash Burn, Jason Dunn's life is unraveling--not coincidentally--and with the authority of his position he's the perfect target for a con motivated by revenge that's been coddled for decades.I hope you enjoy the story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There simply are not enough reliable documents. Those enthusiasts who favour York will remain convinced that Richard was not the monster of Tudor propaganda and that he would have been a beneficial King, bringing success and prosperity to his people. Those who favour the Tudor pretender will firmly believe that Henry VII was a great king who liberated his people from a lengthy civil war and disposed of a blood-soaked tyrant. The truth may lay somewhere between and the following peace might have been very similar who ever had won the final battle.

Her main characters are brilliantly rendered, and repartee is a delight to read whilst in the true spirit of urban fantasy there is plenty of nail biting action, gritty combat sequences and enough twists and turns to keep the most ardent adventure fan sated. Of course, there are a number of well touted titles delivering as much in equal measure, but what makes Domanski's offering noteworthy is a fine sense of humour, which yields some highly memorable one liners and an ability to create wonderful villains. It is strongly recommended! -BookViral.com                              Domanski's characters are the right mix of serious, witty and spunky. They could fit in with Buffy's gang and not miss a bit. I love when a character can deal with life-threatening danger, then turn around and deliver a biting, hilarious one-liner. Domanski excels: Mirissa is just the heroine modern readers are looking for. She's funny, smart, and an amazing warrior. But most importantly, she is someone the reader can relate to and care for. The author's ability to mix action, humor and drama means the Omega Group series is a seriously fun read. I'm impatiently waiting for the next book.

Most of the time, when you read, About The Author, you discover that said author has three dogs, two cats, a turtle named Harley, and enjoys hiking with her husband of five years, and generally, the piece is written in the third person. I have no quarrel with such an expose, it’s just not for me. If you are reading this assume you really do want to know About Me, and I want to give you that, from me, so here you go. I write about the Dominant/submissive dynamic, because I am a submissive, and having experienced the thrills and spills that D/s romance offers, I don’t just feel qualified to do so, but I am truly, deeply and wholly passionate about the lifestyle. Every second of every day it’s on my mind and in my heart, which, by the way, has been shattered into a thousand tiny pieces, and made shining and whole and filled with joy. Such are the highs and lows Dominance and submission can bring. Having tried and failed with vanilla relationships, during which I was constantly frustrated and unfulfilled, I came to an understanding and acceptance that vanilla simply doesn’t work for me.

The storyline is engaging and Dennis' characters are so well written that you almost want to invite them to your next barbeque. Port Starbird should find a home on every shelf and become a yearly reading ritual.From PUBLISHERS WEEKLY:When a wealthy developer suspected of murder comes offering money for the land, Ketch is the last to hold out. Ketch's knowledge of the island is professorial and at times the novel reads like a history of Hatteras Island, something that will appeal to readers who adore a strong sense of place. The accented dialogue creates the right southern atmosphere... A good effort.From AMAZON.COM Vine Reviews:Really well-developed characters, especially Ketch and the Captain. I already feel like I know them. Plus, they are unique people, very quirky and entertaining... I thought the author did a great job of balancing information, history, and story... Very good writing in terms of both word choice and actual structure.From Gee Gee Rosell, owner, Buxton Village Books:The title being StarBIRD instead of Starboard should give you a hint of the humor in this book. Dennis has woven a thick line of suspense through a coastal cultural dark comedy. Throw in a dash of romance and you have a terrific summer read with the flavor of Hiaasen and White.

Fast forward two years, shortly after having my second child, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. During my fight against this disease, I began researching possible causes. I soon began to learn just how many harmful ingredients were not identified on product labels.  I vowed once I recovered to share my knowledge through my newly established company producing all natural products, that include soaps, balms, bath salts, etc etc.  My books are intended to not only educate, but also to share the knowledge and passion that I have gained through my struggles over the last few years.
