Their work is much more sociologically informed and culturally grounded than prior psychological research focusing on Adorno’s authoritarian personality model.  Indeed, their theory of fundamentalism is rooted in human needs for cognitive coherence, showing how fundamentalist religion provides accessible belief systems with comprehensive explanations for meaning and purpose....This is an important work, and it is easily the best work in the psychology of religion in a decade.\"/m-/Darren E.

Essential reading for students of religion, psychology, and sociology.\"--Crystal L.

Second, it provides rich, instructive, and very interesting information about a range of fundamentalist Christian and Muslim groups.  This material is revealing and will be new to most readers.

For a river with such a famous history, England's Thames measures only 215 miles. Acclaimed novelist and biographer Ackroyd (Hawksmoor;Shakespeare) invites readers on an eclectic, sprawling and delightful cruise of this important waterway. The Thames has been a highway, a frontier and an attack route; it has been a playground and a sewer, a source of water and a source of power, writes Ackroyd. Historians believe the river may have been important for transport and commerce as early as the Neolithic Age. The ancient Egyptian goddess Isis has a long association with the Thames, which was used for baptisms, both pagan and Christian, during the Roman Empire. The British tribes tried to use the Thames as a defense against Julius Caesar's invasion, and the Normans built the Tower of London and Windsor Castle on the Thames as symbols of military preeminence. The royal waterway carried Anne Boleyn to both her coronation and her beheading, and famously served as inspiration for paintings by Turner and Monet and for Handel'sWater Music, commissioned to associate the German-born George I with a potent source of English power. Elegant and erudite, Ackroyd's gathering of rich treats does the famed tributary proud. Illus., maps.(Nov. 4)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She squinted at her watch. Nearly twelve hours since her flight had been canceled, stranding her in a strange city, with no money and less hope. The armrest of the standard-issue airport chair jabbed into her back, already achy from the load she carried around her middle. Every bone in her body protested as she rotated forward and straightened.\"You talk in your sleep,\" a tiny voice commented. \"Somb-niloquy.\"Swiveling toward the sound, Kelsey was speared by a pair of huge liquid-brown eyes in a face that couldn't be more than six years old.\"You talk pretty big for a little girl.\" Kelsey stretched, rolling her head on stiff shoulders.\"I'm a genius.\" The child said it as matter-of-factly as Kelsey would have said, \"I'm a teacher.\" If that was true. Which it wasn't. Not any more anyway. She was no longer a lot of things she'd once been.Glad for the distraction and amused by the dark-haired angel in front of her, Kelsey shifted around on the miserable chair until she found a comfortable spot for her belly and said, \"I've never met a child genius before. What's your name?\"\"Pollyanna.\" A dimple flashed. \"Well, not really. I'm reading that book and decided to change my name. My real name is Mariah.\"\"Pleased to meet you, Mariah. I'm Kelsey.\" Kelsey smiled in spite of the crick in her neck. \"I loved that story, too. Have you seen the movie?\"The child looked shocked. \"Absolutely not. Daddy says the book is always better than the movie so you should read before watching and then compare and contrast.\"\"Daddy is absolutely right.\" Wherever he was. Kelsey glanced around but spotted no one watching the little girl. The man should be arrested for allowing a child this young to run around a huge airport unsupervised.\"We've been stranded here in Denver all day waiting on clearance. Actually, seventeen hours and twenty-two minutes but that's close enough to a day, don't you think?\"\"Yes, I do. I've been here for twelve.\"\"It's fun, isn't it?\" Fun wasn't the exact term Kelsey would use. \"There are so many interesting people to talk to. Did you know the man over there,\" the child pointed, \"works for the queen of Netherlands? He's going to send me her autograph. And that lady over there is really upset because her boyfriend moved to Syracuse with his mother. She gave me a dollar to go away. I bought her a cup of coffee with it. Daddy says never take money from strangers.\"\"Did he ever tell you not totalkto strangers?\"\"All the time.\" The child giggled, covering her mouth with both hands. Long dark curls danced around her shoulders. \"But I'm discerning.\"\"What if I were a bad person?\"\"Are you?\"\"No. I'm a teacher.\" Or was before she'd given up everything to be Mark's wife. \"And I like kids. But I could have been a bad person.\"Brown eyes batted in innocence. \"What could happen in a crowded airport?\"Well, actually lots of things, but Kelsey wasn't one to frighten small, unattended children. \"Bad people have ways.\"\"But you aren't bad. You're nice. You're having a baby. Mommies are always nice, except I don't have one, but I'm interviewing. Would you like to be interviewed for the position?\"Kelsey laughed, though the sound was hollow and tinged with bitterness. \"For the position of mommy?\"\"Well, Daddy wants me to have a private tutor-slash-nanny. But I really want a mommy. My first mommy died a long time ago.\" If the memory pained her, the little girl gave no indication, but Kelsey couldn't stop the sharp pang of sympathy.\"So,\" the little girl went on, \"do you think you could handle both positions?\"For tutorandmommy? What an interesting conversation. And Kelsey had no idea how to respond to such a question without treading on unpleasant ground. Fortunately, she didn't have to. At that precise moment, a harried man sprinted toward them. Tie askew, his jacket billowed out at the sides. Kelsey did her best not to notice the lean, lanky, fit body beneath.\"Mariah!\"A radiant smile lit the little girl's face. \"There comes my daddy. He's nice. You'll like him.\"Considering that she'd already formed a negative opinion of the man, Kelsey doubted it. Especially now that she saw him. Even without her contacts, she would have noticed this guy and run the other way—if she could move that fast. Tall and dark, with hair and eyes that matched his daughter's, he was too good-looking. Too successful-looking, too. And she was so off good-looking, successful men it wasn't even funny.The child leaned in and whispered conspiratorially, \"He's been really depressed lately. Almost clinical. Don't tell him I mentioned it, but I thought you should know. It's the whole thing with that Dallas Businessman of the Year Award and the pressure of success. Being discerning as I am, I can tell. It's such a trial for him to deal with a genius child and run a multi-million dollar operation. So, if I can just find a mommy to keep me under control and out of his hair while he works, I'm sure he'll be better.\"Kelsey stared at the child and then at the father, coming toward them like a stealth bomber, fast and furious, sleek and dangerous. It really irked her that this bright child thought she was a bother to her father. How unfair, and what a jerk he must be to make her feel that way.\"Daddy, come on over and meet my friend, Kelsey. She's having a baby, and I'm interviewing her for the job.\"The man closed his eyes briefly and shook his head, hands on hips to catch his breath from what must have been a jog around the concourse.\"I apologize for my daughter, Miss—\" When she only stared instead of filling in the blank, he finished with \"—Kelsey. I'm Ryan Storm.\"His name sent a shock wave through her. Ryan Storm?Ohmigosh.It couldn't be. But a second look through squinted eyes confirmed it. Itwashim. Ryan Storm, backstreet boy of Bartlett High turned Wall Street wonder, all grown up and looking good. Real good.He didn't know it, but she'd once had a crush on him, most likely because he'd been so unsuitable for a goody-two-shoes who never broke the rules.She'd always had lousy taste in men.\"You've already met my errant child, Mariah, who will likely be the death of me.\" He took the little girl by the hand. Mariah beamed up at him with unabashed adoration. \"I'm sorry if she was bothering you.\"\"She's actually very entertaining.\" And you should have known where she was.\"That's one word for it.\"Mariah at his side, he slid into the chair next to Kelsey, bringing with him the scent of a very recognizable and equally expensive men's cologne. How could he smell good after so long in an airport? She probably smelled like dirty gym socks.\"Where you headed, Kelsey?\" he asked, as if she wanted to have this conversation.\"Nowhere.\"He looked surprised at the empty answer, and she winced. Shouldn't let her hopelessness stick out for everyone to see. The last thing she wanted was pity. She had enough of that for herself.\"Actually, I'm going to Dallas.\" She cast a doubtful eye at the huge observation windows. Sleet continued to ping against the panes. \"Someday.\"He grinned, and darn if he wasn't even better looking. She flat out hated him. \"I know what you mean. We're going to Dallas, too.\"She knew that. Everyone who could read knew Ryan Storm lived in, worked in and practically owned Dallas. Ryan Storm, businessman of the year, entrepreneur, most eligible bachelor. All the things she didn't like in a man.Well, actually there was one more thing she didn't like in a man. Deceit. Mark had been so good at keeping her in the dark. And none of that was Ryan Storm's fault or his daughter's. It was her own fault for being so gullible, for wanting to believe.The man of the year had turned to look at her during the conversation and suddenly his eyes narrowed. \"I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but you look familiar. Have we met?\"She almost laughed. Did he realize how insulting that was? Not only did he not recognize her, he wanted to be sure she didn't mistake his question for interest in her as a woman. Like anyone would be interested in a pregnant cow who hadn't had a shower and shampoo since night before last.\"Bartlett High, Dallas east side, Mrs. Rutger's history class. Although you slept through most of it.\"A flicker of recognition dawned behind an intense brown gaze. His mouth dropped open and he raised one finger in a struggle to remember her name. \"Kelsey…Kelsey…\" He snapped his fingers. \"Kelsey Slater, boy hater.\"The old nickname made Kelsey laugh. She hadn't really hated boys, but with braces, glasses and freckles, the oft-repeated comment served as ego protection. Guys liked her. They just didn't date her. The butterfly hadn't exited her cocoon until after high school. Contacts, straight teeth and the right makeup had done a world of wonders.\"It's Kelsey Mason now, but how did you remember that silly nickname?\"Expensive fabric whispered as Ryan lifted one wide shoulder. \"A mind that never shuts off.\"\"You mean the way it did while your daughter was running around the airport alone?\" She widened her eyes in horror. Had she really said that?\"Pardon?\"Apparently she had, and the man of the year hadn't taken it too well. \"Never mind. None of my business.\"Braces may have fixed her teeth but nothing had corrected her habit of saying what she thought. Sometimes her big mouth got her in trouble.Mariah, who had been patiently taking in the conversation, tugged on her father's sleeve. \"Daddy, please. You're interrupting our interview.\"Ryan dragged his offended gaze from Kelsey to his daughter. \"Sorry, peanut, but I don't think Kelsey would be interested in the position.\"\"But I think she might bethe one,Daddy, although we haven't yet discussed credentions or salary.\"\"Credentials,\" he corrected.Mariah nodded. Her curls bounced on the shoulder of a dark green jumper. \"You can ask her about that.\"\"I don't think so. Married ladies usually aren't seeking nanny positions.\" He indicated Kelsey's left hand. \"See? She has a wedding ring.\"Boy, was ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

September could bring nasty weather into her mountainous corner of the Carolinas, and that purply black sky in the early evening meant nothing good.She turned to Jimmy Miller, her stock clerk. \"You can go ahead and leave. It's ready to storm.\"The sixteen-year-old's freckled face brightened with a grin. \"Cool, huh?\"\"Only if I'm indoors—which is where you better get going unless you want to become a lightning rod.\"With a wave, Jimmy ran off, and Steph resumed her nightly routine. She tallied up the prescriptions she'd filled, crosschecked her computer list against her handwritten log and relaxed when everything matched up. She then locked her controlled-substances cabinet, brought down the metal grate over the counter, twisted the combination knob, left the pharmacy part of the store and then secured that door as well.With her purse over her right shoulder and the night-deposit sack under her elbow, she latched the front of the store, set the alarm and slipped out the back. The satisfyingsnickof the dead bolt gave her a sense of security each and every night. She'd done everything she could to protect the community from drug thieves. That was a major source of concern and topic of discussion among pharmacists of late.As she took the key from the regular door lock, an unexpectedscritchsounded behind her.Steph froze. Before she could turn, she was shoved off the back steps. She flew through the air, the key clutched tight in her fist. She landed on the filthy asphalt alley floor by the communal Dumpster, banging her right leg against the cold metal.Pain stole her breath, but she knew what she had to do.\"Help!\" Steph yelled, so loud her face throbbed from the effort.A dark figure launched itself onto her back. The sharp blow from a knee to her spine took her breath away. Her attacker's weight on her middle flattened her against the ground; the upright position gave the mugger advantage over her.\"Give me the key,\" her attacker said in a guttural whisper.Steph squirmed, tossed, bucked and kicked, all the time holding the key in her fist. She shoved her hand between her abdomen and the asphalt, out of the mugger's reach. The rough surface ground away at the skin on her knuckles. With each kick at her assailant, the knees of her pants ripped more. At no time did she stop screaming.At no time did her assailant stop beating. Her shoulders and the back of her head felt each blow twice, once when her attacker struck and then again when she hit the alley floor.Time, however, did stop. Steph registered pain, the heavy weight on her back, the dampness of rain, the stench of trash… and something vaguely spicy and sweet laced in with the rot. Her fear-filled mind couldn't identify it, but she knew it was there, somehow familiar, just beyond her grasp, important but elusive.And still the pounding continued.In what felt like hours, but could only have been a handful of seconds, Steph sustained blows on the head, her back, her arm and both legs. The alley surface scraped her face each time it touched down.\"What's going on here?\"At the sound of local postmaster Andrew Cooper's deep bass voice, the person on Steph's back paused in his assault.\"Who are you?\" Steph bucked one more time. \"Why are you doing this?\"\"Steph?\" Mr. Cooper said. \"Is that you?\"Her attacker stood.Seconds later, footsteps pelted away as the first cold raindrops splashed on Steph's sore back.\"Who's there?\" the postmaster called again, this time closer to Steph.She rolled to her side. \"Please call 911, Mr. Cooper. Someone tried to mug me.\"The portly gentleman trotted up and knelt at her side, cell phone in hand. \"You hurt, missy?\"\"I don't think it's serious, but we do need the PD.\"Dialing, Mr. Cooper tsk-tsked. \"My first thought was about you.\" He put the device to his ear and waited for a response. \"I'll have us someone here, pronto— Yes,\" he said into the phone. \"There's been a mugging behind Scott's Pharmacy…\"With help on the horizon, Steph's eyes welled with tears.Who would have done this? Loganton wasn't a particularly crime-prone town. Besides, it was no secret she didn't make a great deal of money.On the other hand, her pharmacy was rich with drugs, which she kept under lock and key. True, her professional bias immediately brought that to mind, but for what other reason would she have been attacked? Even someone who didn't know her could verify with a minimum of effort how little cash she kept in the store. They could also watch her make the two deposits every day, one at lunchtime and the other after hours.While Loganton was relatively clean by comparison to larger cities, in the past couple of years the town had experienced a scattering of drug overdoses, and last spring Ethan Rodgers and his fiancée, Tess Graver, had nearly died at the hands of a meth dealer.Under the worsening rain, Steph unfurled her right hand. In her damp palm, within four half-moon indentations etched by her nails, lay the key to the door. \"Thank you, Jesus,\" she whispered.She'd kept the drugs where they belonged.At six o'clock, Hal Benson slid into his usual booth at Granny Annie's Diner, the only eatery in Loganton. Even Pepper, his rescued greyhound, turned up her elegant nose at the cooking.As he settled back against the puffy red vinyl seat, Karla, Granny Annie's youngest niece, skidded to a stop by his booth, glass of water, order pad and red ink pen in hand.Hal grabbed for the water in self-defense.\"Hey, Sheriff Hal!\" Karla's cheeks glowed pink, her brown eyes sparkled and her riot of black curls fought the restraints of the hairnet her part-time job forced her to wear. \"You want the same as always?\"He took a drink as he thought for a minute. His frequent meat loaf, mashed potatoes and whatever vegetable Granny Annie offered that day didn't really appeal to him tonight. \"What's the special?\"\"Granny's got two. Spaghetti, salad and garlic bread's one, and the other's chicken potpie, biscuits or corn bread and spiced apples on the side.\"\"Hmm…the chicken sure sounds good. Why don't you bring me some of that?\"\"Iced tea?\"\"Is there anything else a man would want with his meal?\"Karla laughed. \"Not this sheriff, I guess.\"Hal took another sip of water then glanced out the window. The sky was ripe with the incoming thunderstorm. He hoped it would pass quickly; otherwise he was in for a drenching by the time he left the diner. Then he chuckled. If that was the worst thing he had to face that evening, he'd get off lightly.Karla zipped off to the kitchen.A flock of customers sailed in. The flurry of greetings inspired by their arrival filled the diner with the comfort of familiarity. Out of the corner of his eye, Hal saw Karla tear back out from behind the counter with her tray perched on a slender shoulder.\"Beep-beep!\" She smiled at the newcomers in the aisle. \"Beep-beep!\"Before the lively young waitress reached his booth, Hal's cell phone rang. \"Sheriff Benson here.\"\"Hey, sir?\" Patsy Anderson, his newest deputy, had a little-girl voice and the tenacity of a bulldog. \"I'm not sure about this, but since you're already out there for supper, I thought you might want to know.\"Hal held out a hand to slow Karla. \"I want to know. What's up?\"\"Well, sir, it seems when the pharmacist, Miss Scott, went to close up tonight, she got mugged—\"\"I'll be right there. And thanks, Patsy.\" He turned to Karla. \"Can you have Granny hold my supper for me? I've got to go on a call.\"Karla rolled her eyes. \"As if this was new.\"He sighed. Having Granny Annie hold his meal until after he'd taken care of whatever latest problem had erupted was not new. What was new this time was the victim.Steph Scott had been mugged.Hal hurried out, hopped into the cruiser, drove down Main Street, cut across River Run Road, then turned into the alley behind the pharmacy. He parked by the white Loganton PD car already there.Veteran officer Wayne Donnelly and his rookie partner Maggie Lowe stood on one side of the back steps to the pharmacy, while Mr. Cooper, the postmaster, stood on the other. Steph sat on the top step, visibly shaken. All three were drenched by the now steady rain and blowing wind.While Maggie smiled a greeting, Wayne frowned. Steph looked scared.Hal tapped the brim of his hat, working to hold his concern at bay. \"I was about to eat supper at Granny Annie's when my deputy called. She figured since I was close by, I might be interested in what happened. I know you guys have jurisdiction, so I'm not here officially, unless you want my help, that is. Just came to offer, since Granny Annie's is so close.\"Steph glanced up at him, her gray eyes huge. \"All help is welcome,\" she said, her voice low.Hal shoved his hands in his pockets. That was that. It would now take an act of congress to budge him. \"What happened?\"Maggie turned. \"It sounds pretty typical. Steph was closing up shop when the mugger attacked. She fought him and was able to keep him from getting the key to the store.\"Out of the corner of his eye, Hal saw Steph shiver. \"Hang on.\"He ran to his cruiser. There was no reason for her to be cold as well as hurt when he had an unused jacket in the car. The abrasions on her face were bad enough.\"Here.\" He held out the navy waterproof coat seconds later. \"You need it more than my trunk does.\"For a moment, he thought she'd argue. It wouldn't surprise him if she did. He'd watched Steph put everyone else's needs before hers for years now, even back when they'd both been in school. She'd always been the one to help rather than the one who received the help. This time, however, she was in need.Hal was about to insist when she surprised him by reaching out and taking the jacket. Their fingers grazed in the exchange, and the electric shock of awareness that hit him took his breath away.

The dust cloud kicked up byshe was certainNez Perce warriors, turned out to be the signature of her husband's horse's hooves. When he found his family on the banks of the Blackfoot River, preparing for an eternal swim, Nels was understandably upset.Most women of her era would have kept this episode of paranoia to themselves. They most certainly would have kept it from their children. Because Emma candidly shared her stories with her daughter, we now have a better understanding of what life was like in Idaho Territory, not just on the windswept plains, but in the heart of a woman.Divorced from a scoundrel who she, never-the-less, still loved and with an infant boy to raise, Emma's situation seemed hopeless. Then along came a young Dane named Nels. He did not offer much: living in a hole in a river bank with a buffalo robe for a door. Still, it seemed a chance worth taking.And so their story began with a marriage of convenience, if not desperation. Emma followed her new husband to a secluded valley along the Blackfoot River in 1870 where she would raise sons and bury daughters. Nels would go on to be a leading figure in Idaho, a canal builder, a banker and a farmer. Emma would be a mother to four boys and, at last, one girl. She would be the star witness in a sensational trial about a religious war that echoes eerily today in incidents like Waco and Jonestown. Mostly she was a proud, brave woman who survived lonely, heartbreaking years before civilization crept into the West.Emma told her story to daughter Agnes, who set it down as a series of letters, each of which Emma approved as it came out of the typewriter. The resulting book was first published in 1923. It was on the press the day Emma died.Letters of Long ago is a haunting, often heart-breaking book you will not soon forget. --Book Description", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Soon, however, a group of cultlike enthusiasts called “videophiles” began to trade movies and other content they had recorded, usually through crudely published, limited-circulation newsletters. Videophiles were eager to bring the experience of the big screen into the comfort of their homes, but with Hollywood reluctant to release control of its movies on the new medium, it was mainly adult films that initially broke into the rental market. Greenberg rewinds the movie-rental phenomenon back to when mom-and-pop entrepreneurs with a pioneer spirit took a chance on a new technology and a culture of movie fanatics to create a successful new business—the video store. The video rental store became a social gathering place for movie buffs to share knowledge, trivia and their love of the cinema, until family-friendly Blockbuster all but killed off the local video store with its seedy back room. Greenberg effectively re-creates the excitement that was in the air at the dawn of the video age. --David Siegfried", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The purpose of the journal is to analyze and evaluate ideas, trends, events, and policies accordingly.We maintain that the standards of both knowledge and value derive from the facts of reality; that truth is discovered only by means of reason (i.e., through observation and logic); that the factual requirements of man's life on earth determine his moral values; that the selfish pursuit of one's own life-serving goals is virtuous; and that individual rights are moral principles defining the fundamental requirements of a civilized society.We stand opposed to the notion that the standards of knowledge and value are not factual but subjective (feeling-based) or other-worldly (faith-based); that truth is ultimately dictated by majority opinion or a \"supernatural\" being's will; that democratic consensus or \"God's word\" determines what is moral; that sacrifice for the common good or in obedience to \"God's commands\" is virtuous; and that rights are social conventions or \"divine decrees.\"In stark contrast to these philosophic approaches, ours is a philosophy of reality, reason, egoism, and laissez-faire capitalism. In a word, we uphold Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, and it serves as our frame of reference in analyzing the cultural and political issues of the day.Kindle Magazines are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

This is the message that Naugle, professor of philosophy at Dallas Baptist University, eloquently presents. He argues that human beings have always searched for happiness, but come up empty most of the time because we cling to things of the created world rather than to the Creator. His prose is engaging, peppered with intriguing quotes from pop culture books, music and movies that propel his exposition along. The author's discussion of virtues is particularly compelling, and his presentation breathes new life into this topic. Many Christians will enjoy this book and be renewed in their quest for true happiness. Others will not, given the author's insistence that accepting Jesus is the only way to real happiness. In a religiously pluralistic world, the wisdom of Christianity can be shared with everyone if presented correctly. While the author lost that opportunity here, he is able to capture the sense of longing to live for something greater than themselves that so many feel, regardless of their religious views.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Washed-up alcoholic reporter Cassandra Bloomgarten gets a career reboot when a sensational \"runaway bride\" case erupts in the town of Mesopotamia, Tenn., near Memphis. Adopted from a Korean orphanage and raised in the area by a Jewish family, Cassandra may have the local connections to grab the headline, but what happens when she stumbles across two dead Elvis impersonators and a large family left fatherless by a meth lab explosion? The plot thickens-- or zigzags. Nersesian (Suicide Casanova) ambles along, almost getting lost in sitcom territory with the adorable fatherless kids, but he recovers when Cassandra enters an Elvis impersonator contest. A surprise ending won't be much of a shock to anyone who knows Elvis lore, but the loose, amiable read carries you through.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person.

However, its title is a little misleading; pathology is not covered at all so the word 'Normal' should have been in the title.  That said, this short book is a useful and handy reference work that covers all the major musculoskeletal applications (e.g. shoulder, ankle) as well as minor ones (chest and abdominal walls) with generally excellent images. Most of these are compound images and many use an extended field of view mode.  All are fully labelled though, sadly, the distance scales have been cropped making it difficult to appreciate the size of the structure shown. The accompanying text is in the form of notes and there is space for the user to supplement these  in fact this is sometimes overly generous, occasionally amounting to entire empty pages, which may have lines or be blank!  In summary, a useful atlas, well laid out and with excellent images.  NEW REVIEW -- BRADLEY / Atlas of Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Anatomy.  Greenwich Medical Media, 2002, USD39.95.  [AUTHOR]  Bradley, Mike, FRCR; O'Donnell, Paul, FRCR  [BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA]  ISBN: 1-8411-0118-4, 260 pages, soft cover.  [DOODY'S NOTES]  [REVIEWER'S EXPERT OPINION]  Trystain D. Johnson, M.D.(University of Colorado Health Sciences Center)  Description  This book is a concise diagrammatic and illustrative atlas of basic musculoskeletal anatomy pertinent to ultrasound examination.  Purpose  The authors aim to provide the fundamental anatomic knowledge needed to examine the musculoskeletal system by sonography. This book serves this purpose adequately, providing the groundwork in normal anatomy which the reader can expand on with more comprehensive atlases and textbooks.  Audience  Intended for those beginning to learn how to scan the musculoskeletal system, this book is suitable for sonographers, students, residents and practitioners. Drs. Bradley and O'Donnell are credible voices for this introduction.  Features  In a segmental approach, all commonly imaged areas are covered in various planes to best show the anatomy. Images are clearly marked with only pertinent labels, and most diagrams and images fall on the same page to more easily correlate transducer orientation, body site and ultrasound imagery. The extremities, particularly the wrists and hands, are well covered. In the case of the shoulder, however, the most widely scanned area in musculoskeletal sonography, the coverage is a bit light, perhaps requiring additional referencing.  Assessment  This book is a worthwhile basic reference for those learning to scan the musculoskeletal system, but not comprehensive enough for those who will also interpret the images. This atlas covers some material that larger, reference textbooks do, but without the verbosity. If a basic anatomic atlas for musculoskeletal ultrasound is needed, Drs. Bradley and O'Donnell have", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the good doctor falls ill, the toys get the chance to return the favor and take care of him.

References to the snowman doll's illness and “wild Indian” have been removed. Perplexingly, the story does continue to refer to cough drops as “good as candy and just as pretty” and to mention writing prescriptions for measles, mumps, chicken pox, and whooping cough.

Her love for sailing, art and the water bloomed during those early years.   As a teenager, she was a sailing instructor at many of the area's yacht clubs and for the Annapolis Sailing School.  She also spent weekends sailing in local regattas and onboard her parents' 37' ketch.  Summers were spent at their beach house on the Isle of Palms, and vacations and holidays were spent on Seven Mile beach in Grand Cayman, where she sailed her sunfish in their Sunday regattas. She attended the College of Charleston from 1982-1986, graduating with a BA in visual arts, specifically, printmaking, drawing and painting.  She was a member of the College of Charleston's sailing team for four years, sailing as the 'A' division skipper for the women's team and also for the 'B' division co-ed team.   The team finished first place overall at the college sailing nationals in 1986.     In 1988, she received her MFA (Master's of Fine Art) at Clemson University.  Mercedes' artwork has been purchased for many private collections around the Southeast.  She was one of seven printmakers chosen for the Library of Congress Permanent Print Collection during a printmaking convention for the entire Southeast region in 1987. Her artwork has been shown in many juried exhibitions and several one-woman shows in galleries throughout the state.  She has received two honorable mentions in the Piccolo Spoleto Juried art show in Charleston in 1986 and 1987. With her passion for teaching, she taught art for several art councils and for many schools in South Carolina through the Arts in Education Program. She married Ronald G. Sykora, Jr. in 1988. They have two children, Christopher, born in 1991, and Stephanie, born in 1993.  To fulfill the family's dream of visiting every Caribbean island, they set out on their two year sailing adventure.  Mercedes home schooled the children and kept a journal of their family's adventures.   She found time for her artwork, which continues to reflect her emotions about the geography of the ocean.  She is back in Charleston, counting the days until she and her husband return to life as liveaboards...somewhere.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You will read with more precise comprehension. No longer will you constantly skim over unfamiliar words. The new words learned will jump out of the pages with exact definitions. Words read repeatedly will become part of the active vocabulary -- the vocabulary used in writing and speech.The most immediate and dramatic benefit will be higher scores on scholastic tests. Build Your Vocabulary Skills! can be a valuable tool in preparing for tests such as the SAT, the GRE, the Miller Analogies, or any test in which vocabulary is a significant factor.

His books impress on the reader the possibility and necessity for a deeper relationship with God. Living a simple and non-materialistic lifestyle, he and his wife, Ada Cecelia Pfautz, never owned a car, preferring bus and train travel. Even after becoming a well-known Christian author, Tozer signed away much of his royalties to those who were in need. Tozer had seven children, six boys and one girl. He was buried in Ellet Cemetery, Akron, Ohio, with a simple epitaph marking his grave: \"A. W. Tozer - A Man of God.\" Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life.

Mit 17 Jahren ging er nach New York, dann nach Philadelphia, wo er die ersten Reiseskizzen schrieb.  Von 1857 bis 1860 war er Lotse auf dem Mississippi, nahm am Sezessionskrieg auf der Seite der Konföderierten teil und war 1861 Silbersucher in Nevada. 1864 lebte er in San Francisco, 1866 als Reporter auf Hawaii und 1867 als Reisender in Europa und Palästina. Er gründete einen Verlag, mußte aber 1894 Konkurs anmelden und ging auf Weltreise, um mit Vorträgen seine Schulden abzutragen.  Mark Twain starb am 21.04.1910 in Redding (Connecticut).", "related": [], "rank": 46555, "title": "Huckleberry Finns Abenteuer und Fahrten (German Edition) eBook", "author": "Mark Twain", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Striker Dark reached for his phone while keeping his gaze on the queen of England. She cut her eyes at him for a split second, and, without missing a beat, she continued to address the dignitaries with stiff royal aplomb.After a quick look around, he astral projected out the banquet room's closest exit. He would take the call and get back before the humans present even realized he'd left his seat.Two of the queen's MI10 agents, a vampire and a leopard shifter, noticed. They were the only Supes (supernaturals) in the room who could follow his departure. They eyed him with distaste. MI10 was a highly classified counterintelligence agency within Great Britain, the counterpart to Striker's own UnitedStates Bureau of Supernatural Phenomena. They both dealt with anything supernatural and kept it hidden from humans, and duties sometimes included protecting royalty and government officials. Two of Striker's own agents were safeguarding the President of the United States right now. But MI10 agents thought themselves a cut above their Yank cousins, and for that reason Striker ignored them completely as he paused in the hallway.His phone wasn't your typical landline. A crystal, developed especially for him by the tech-support staff at B.O.S.P., drove the gizmo. His clairvoyant powers absorbed the energy it released, and it amplified them. It was like having an omnipresent stalker exploding in his head. Even before he opened the lid he knew something was dreadfully wrong.His gut flinched, and he couldn't believe the image appearing before his eyes. Hover demons floated and circled five of his agents.Hover demons could be easily summoned; they killed for pleasure, unlike doom demons, who tortured their victims and demanded payment for their enjoyment. There were as many types of demons as there were types of angels. Angels and demons had their many uses, but Striker refused to summon hovers for anything. They were unpredictable, and in his line of work unpredictability was a detriment.Black hooded robes covered the demons' bodies and faces, but the flamethrowers and scythes in their hands were clearly visible. His agents were near them, on their knees, execution style. Silver chains crisscrossed their vampire bodies and held them immobile. Striker knew every one of the agents by name. He had trained them himself. They were the elite at B.O.S.P. How could this happen?In the moonlit background, Striker noticed a wharf. Warehouse lights cast eerie shadows over their faded fronts. Boats rocked against the pier, and he saw the Suter's Marina sign. He knew that place. New Orleans.A hover paused, the edge of his robe rippling as he lowered the blowtorch and fired. Aquarius, a two-hundred-year-old vamp and one of Striker's OIC's, screamed. A rictus of pain and helplessness distorted his face.Abruptly, the scythe chopped down on his neck.His head rolled like a ball and settled near his knees. One blink of recognition from his eyes, and then the life left Aquarius's face forever.Another demon closed in on the next agent in line. Fizz! Chop! Fizz! Chop! Another shriek. Chop!Striker wanted to feel sympathy or empathy, but there was nothing left inside to let him feel. He had lived too long on the earth, and it had killed his human sensitivity. It was as if the world had lost all its color and he observed it from an objective, sterile black-and-white environment now. Still, he couldn't look at his own agents, the ones whom he directed and had sent to their deaths, without feeling the injustice. A tiny snarl lifted one corner of his lip, and he felt his fangs extend.Suddenly the phone's camera turned upward, and a female face he recognized spun into view. Real name: Skye Rainwater, aka Simone Poindexter, aka Lilly Smith. Code name: Culler. She stared back him. Her vibrant blue eyes filled up the screen, the dark, sooty lashes caked with mascara. Eyes so deeply entrenched in his mind that he'd see them the rest of his life.\"Hello, Nightwalker,\" she said. \"Enjoying this little show?\"Striker heard another yell, and it cut the back of his neck like the teeth of a chain saw. \"Culler,\" Striker said. \"What the hell are you doing? Help them!\"\"I have. Can't you see that?\"So it was real. \"How did you set up this bloodbath?\"\"Just called Aquarius and told him Raithe was receiving a shipment of girls.\"Aquarius should have known better, followed protocol and called Striker. It wasn't the first time Aquarius had broken rank, only this time he'd paid dearly—with his life. \"What has happened to you?\"\"I'm tired of being out in the field, risking my life and doing your dirty work for the measly pennies you drop my way.\"\"We invested half a million in your cover. That is a lot of pennies.\" Striker's voice turned low, soft and quite deadly. He envisioned wrapping his hands around her neck and squeezing…. \"How could you betray B.O.S.P. like this?\"\"I don't live and breathe the agency like you. I'm a free spirit. And who are we kidding? This is your vendetta, not B.O.S.P.'s. Raithe just helped me see I was on the wrong side.\"\"I will find you.\"\"You can try.\" She cackled, her eyes gleaming bright blue with malice. Then the screen went blank.Striker thought of headquarters, and Mimi's small angular face appeared in the screen. Anyone looking at her reflection could tell she was a dwarf. What her looks didn't reveal was her penchant for voodoo. She looked bored until she noticed who it was. A grin spread across her face, and she batted her false eyelashes as she fluffed her curly blond hair. \"Anything I can get you, boss?\"Striker knew she was referring to something other than work, but he always ignored her advances. And this was no different. He went directly to the point. \"I need the dossier on Culler. Send it right away, and see what aliases you can find that are not in our files. And use the psychics. I do not want one stone unturned.\"\"You got it, boss.\"\"Any sightings of Raithe?\" Striker had recently upped the bounty on Raithe in the paranormal community, but as of yet no one was brave enough to collect the three million dollars.\"No, sorry,\" she said forlornly. She knew Raithe was on Striker's top-ten wanted list.\"All right, then. Waiting on the dossier.\"He closed the device and shoved it in his pocket. He would apologize later to the queen. He didn't have time for niceties or foreign diplomatic dinner parties. He had to find Culler.She had been his only hope. What had happened to make her turn? They had been so close to catching Raithe. Striker's lip lifted in a tiny snarl as he thought of his nemesis. Raithe controlled much of the underbelly of the human and vampire races. He dealt in everything from drugs to prostitution to providing living victims for vampires to drain and kill. A real nice upstanding vampire was Raithe.Striker had been hunting Raithe for hundreds of years, and not once had he been able to get this close to him. It had taken ten years of undercover work, but Culler had finally gained Raithe's trust. Striker didn't want to think about the evils Culler must have endured and participated in to prove her fealty to Raithe. Culler kept assuring Striker that she was okay and didn't need a psychological evaluation. She promised Striker she could locate Raithe's den, but she needed more time. Through the years, she'd given Striker several leads on child-pornography rings and snuff-film makers, mostly throughout Europe, even a bordello filled with werepanthers Raithe tortured for his own amusement, but not the one thing Striker wanted: Raithe.Then Culler had turned on him and joined Raithe. At the thought of his nemesis, Striker felt his fangs jut out more and scrape his lower lip. He tasted his own blood and realized he and Raithe were more similar than he cared to admit. They were both ruthless in their own way, both unable to stop until the other was eradicated.Takala Rainwater stuffed the last bite of a ham and cheese croissant in her mouth as she saw the road sign for the Woodlawn Terrace subdivision. A cemetery name if she ever saw one. Right up there with Pleasant Green and Quiet Acres.She made an uneasy face as she turned right, finished off a can of Pepsi, and drove her MINI Cooper down the road. The streets of Fredericksburg looked like any other quiet residential neighborhood in February. Neatly groomed houses lined the block. Rows of dormant flower gardens waited for winter to end and spring to begin. Evidence of a recent snow still painted the lawns in a sheen of white. The pockmarked bodies of melting snowmen waved to her from some of the yards. The only evidence of death here was the name of the road.She grabbed the note lying beside her and looked at the address Blake had given her. Blake Green worked for the FBI's Data and Statistics Department. A friend since high school. He gleaned information for Takala's private investigating agency, and in return Takala sprung for his dinner at a four-star restaurant once a month.Blake had been searching for evidence of Takala's mother for four years, since joining the FBI. Blake was a bloodhound when it came to finding information, and Skye Rainwater had become one of his obsessions. Finally he'd got a hit this morning. He had flagged the name, and someone must have been researching it, because the flag popped up. He had followed the electronic trail and called Takala all excited, telling her that he'd discovered information in the State Department database on Skye Rainwater. She had two aliases, Simone Poindexter and Lilly Smith. He also gave Takala Lilly Smith's LKA (last known address) here in the States. Surprisingly, it was in Fredericksburg, Virginia, not seventy miles from the Patomani Indian reservation where Takala ...", "related": ["B004U73T5M"], "rank": 2220781, "title": "Nightwalker (The Nightwalkers Book 3)", "author": "Connie Hall", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Goff, a sports enthusiast and Lynchburg College physics professor, is more than comfortable analyzing a variety of feats of physical prowess, such as a spectacular play in the final seconds of a legendary 1982 Stanford-Berkeley college football game. After analyzing that play with its five lateral passes, Goff moves on to stage 16 of Lance Armstrong's 2004 Tour de France win, and a record-breaking long jump by Bob Beamon at the 1968 Summer Olympics. While the discussion of the mechanics of angular momentum using the spins and rotations of ice skating and diving (Katarina Witt and Greg Louganis, respectively) will be familiar to nearly anyone who's read a physics textbook, Goff surprises with chapters on how to bend it like Beckham, win at sumo wrestling, and use statistics and probability to predict college football outcomes. Sports fans with a knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will enjoy Goff's cheerful revisiting of memorable athletic events. 70 illus.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that\nwere richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril'sAlliance (upcoming in late 2012)CryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to\ncompletists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed HuntThe short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading! -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jake Morrison is a bright, young and ambitious attorney\nhell-bent on achieving his vision of success. But his vision is about to become\na nightmare. Zara Jane is a real-live Angel, sent from Heaven above to guide\nJake through these pivotal changes in Jake's life. She ends up working at\nJake's firm and dating him, so that she can watch over him. They fall in love.\nBut Jake rejects the message and her love and his life spirals out of control.\nAs an Angel Zara Jane imparts wisdom and insight for his life and world, and\nexpresses her insight on the road that lies ahead, not only for Jake, but also\nfor humankind as a whole. After Zara Jane has been given\npermission by the Angel Oversight Committee that she would be allowed to live\nwith Jake and experience human emotions, like love, first hand. They end up\nliving together in her mansion in Beverly\n Hills, formingParadise\nParanormal Investigations, Inc.together, solving capers together. This book is designed to help\nstimulate your strategic thinking when it comes to luck, and love, to help you\nrealize that everything in our lives really can have mystical significance! Enjoy the journey!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But reading Olympia writer Tami Dahlgren's book The Garden this week, I was reminded of those televised Hallmark specials, way back when conventional broadcast television was the only game around.  With the plot Dahlgren has concocted, you ll get a similar mix of life-changing events, emotional journeys and sentimental symbolism. There are crusty old folks with hearts of gold, dewy-eyed youths with so much yet to learn, and the generation in the middle, making its way in spite of life s upheavals and disappointments. It is a serviceable formula and seems comforting somehow. The themes of continuity and hope are good ones for these dark winter days. The story goes like this: Kate, a nurse in southern California, has been widowed recently. Her husband had been drunk when he drove into another car, and he and two others were killed. To escape the gossip that has lingered after this tragedy, Kate moves her teen daughter Lindsay and 9-year-old son Jack away from southern California to a small rural community in Washington state. She s lined up a new job caring for a terminally ill cancer patient and hopes to make a new start. The patient, Evie Hastings, is a retired schoolteacher who is well-known throughout the community. She lives alone in a large house in the country and has no family to look after her. Evie s doctor, a former pupil of hers, has arranged for Kate to serve as her caregiver. At first, Evie doesn t need much help. She is accustomed to being self-sufficient as evidenced by her tidy house, well-stocked larder, and large garden. She has a domineering personality from years of teaching the old-school way, and she succeeds in bossing around Kate, her doctor, and just about everyone else. However, she and timid young Jack strike up an unlikely friendship over his math homework and her sugar cookies. Evie has a knack for getting to know everyone s business. Malice is not her motivation once the old woman pries information out of people, she unfailingly seeks to address the problems she uncovers. Even in waning health, Evie delights in serving as matchmaker, tutor, babysitter, college adviser, and more. Just as she has tended her garden so diligently through the years, so she looks after her community in her own inimitable manner. But it is only to Kate, the outsider, that Evie eventually confides her own dark secret. Dahlgren has incorporated a range of dramatic events into this story from car crashes and flooding rivers to school bullies and marauding deer. She s also created an entire neighborhood s worth of engaging and sympathetic characters. This makes for an involving read, although sometimes the author runs into trouble as she tries to juggle the perspectives of several different characters. Nonetheless, the story's message of carrying on in the face of adversity comes through loud and clear. --Barbara Lloyd McMichael, The Bookmonger columnTami Dahlgren captures the beauty and complexity of human relationships to a T. It's the book you want to pick up when you need assurance that despite this world's sorrows and mayhem, the people we love, and sometimes total strangers, make it all worthwhile.  Not just a chick book, my brother, who is not short on testosterone, found it a lovely and thought provoking read. This debut novel's character development is outstanding. --Amazon.comEnjoyed this book. Our Book Club read it and all 9 members gave it a Loved It rating. Very true to life characters. Lovely depiction of community caring and friendship in a small Northwest town. We recommend it. --Goodreads.com", "related": [], "rank": 616393, "title": "The Garden eBook", "author": "Tami Dahlgren", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Foster says the body quickly gets used to that extra glass, and before they know it may be downing a bottle or more a night. I mainly deal with people who are not ruining their lives with alcohol but recognise that they drink more than they should, and they have got into a bit of a rut. Many people have got themselves into an automatic pattern of drinking, which is pure habit. They start drinking because of social shyness, or to de-stress and turn off from the difficulties they face daily, and that slowly creeps up because the more they do it the more the mind thinks it is normal. Foster helps people to unlearn these habits and establish healthier ones . --The Times NewspaperExtract from Psychologies Magazine, April 2008 Even for a self-confessed control freak, it s impossible not to drift away to Georgia s soothing voice as she gently re-programmes our minds to make healthier choices. After the last of the sessions, I am so relaxed that I sleep for 12 hours that night. In the days following the workshop, I leave two (boozy) dinner parties sober, having had less than a couple of glasses of wine without giving it much thought. I feel stronger, partly due to a new awareness of my personal triggers. The common sense tips from Georgia as well as the subliminal mantras such as I am dealing with life more healthily without over-drinking , are present in my mind. I enjoy the festive period without the roaring pain and paranoia associated with hangovers . --Psychologies MagazineIt was a seven year binge that made me overweight, broke and sick....

The United Methodist Church would throw a party every year at Disneyland and we would pilgrimage for a night of fun and frolicking (Dave, I do wonder if you knew the cast member who caught us annoying 10 year olds spitting off the Skyway! After his \"chat\" we definately behaved better!!!) which left us with memories that still warm our hearts today.

We get to live vicariously through him while reading about the free childhood many could only dream of, riding bikes with friends in a small Southern California town and being little scamps finding a clever way to sneak into the park. Later learning of a new excitement; Girls, and the fun of spending time in the park as a young date. Then getting older finding employment in the same park and making strong friendship bonds with fellow cast members, and using it as a means to meet more girls visiting from around the country, only too happy to be a gracious host of Disneyland. The years that follow include college, a successful local band, marrying the final love of his life, teaching, coaching tennis, and eventually as all things come to a full circle, enjoying reliving the magical park that Walt created through his own children.

One of the critical keys to being a successful\ndeer hunter is knowing the indicators that cause bucks to be on their feet and\nmoving. One of the major reasons that most professional hunters can and do hunt\nin places where you and I can't hunt is that they're hunting on private\nproperty where they know the landowner, and where the landowner often tells\nthem where very-large older-age-class bucks have been seen. Hunting pressure\nalso affects deer movement more than any-one factor. For this reason, if you\ncan find a place to hunt where no one else hunts, you often can take the buck\nthat no one else can take.Question: John,\nwhat is it about deer hunting that keeps you in the sport?Phillips: I\nreally enjoy the stillness of morning before first light, listening to the\nsounds that all the animals in the woods make and trying to identify in my mind\nwhat those animals are. I like watching all the deer, the does as well as the\nbucks, to learn more about how they communicate, and what causes them to act\nthe way they do. I enjoy the moment of truth, when all my planning, scheming,\nstudying, scouting and working with my equipment results in a successful hunt.\nBelieve it or not, I also like the butchering process, and I really enjoy\neating venison, which is some of the leanest, most cholesterol-free meat you\ncan eat. I also love remembering the hunts I've been on, the people I've hunted\nwith, and the experiences I've had in the woods, many of which have been with\nmy family.", "related": ["B004WE7TY0"], "rank": 732767, "title": "How to Hunt Deer Like a Pro eBook", "author": "John E.

Only a few of these ebooks have even been worth my time to review, like The Spanish Riding School. Sandy, the main character in the story, has decided to travel for a year to see Europe before opening her own travel agency. Since she has just graduated from college, she isn't as sexually experienced as a mature woman, and the rose on the cover on the ebook not only hints at romance, but also the bloom of her sexual awakening which Sandy experiences when she develops a romantic relationship with her sexy Spanish lover. The author, Aime Brooks, takes time to render the location in vivid detail so that you can envision the beauty of this area of Spain and it adds to the classic romance and sensual appeal. There are more stories in this series, so if you enjoy this ebook, be sure to check out more of Sandy's Stories.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1954 when she was in third grade, a new boy in her class convinced her that his puppies were cocker spaniels whose hair would get curly and whose ears would grow to be long and floppy. Gloria took one of the puppies and named him Champ. His hair never got curly, and his ears never got long and floppy. He was a mutt, but he was a good dog. He and another of Gloria's dogs, Miss Sweet Potato, are the inspiration for the dog Champ in her middle-grade novel, Jenny Maybelle and the Cocker Spaniel Who Needed a Perm. Many other incidents in the book actually happened. Needless to say, Gloria never tumbled into the air and flew. Yet, she felt like she would do just that after her mom gave her a home perm that made her hair stick out like airplane wings. Now she enjoys carrying the story of Jenny Maybelle to children not only through her middle-grade novel but through presentations at libraries and schools. Gloria is retired from her work in family social services, elementary education, nursing home activities, television news, and reporting/editing for small-town newspapers in southeast Louisiana.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm an author like you, and I've faced challenges too.  My first novel made it's impressive debut somewhere in the neighborhood of 700,000 on the Amazon rankings. Fortunately, I have an iron will and a background in marketing.  Trust me, anyone who can make a living selling $1.00 balloons is really doing something. With a little determination and implementation of the techniques in this book that same novel can now boast  having been the #1 Kindle Bestselling Gothic and remaining on three bestseller lists for 13 consecutive months. I'm happy to announce that all of my current books can frequently be found on those many revered lists for their categories.While my marketing background certainly gave me a slight advantage that's all it was.  I stumbled through the first six months bouncing up and down on the rankings like a kid on a pogo stick.  If you've been at this at least a few days you know that the process can be exhausting.I wrote this book because somewhere along the way I realized that it was possible to do a few actionable tasks and benefit from them well into the future. While I enjoy all my social media there are times when I cannot be on the internet networking and doing the marketing thing.  As an author I wanted to build a business that could work and produce results without my holding it's hand every moment of the day.  I wanted a business where I could actually write more books.  I didn't start out with intentions to write a book, but along the way I met people just like me who were struggling.  I began to help out and just like it had worked for me, these techiniques (simple as they may be) began to work for them. This book is not one of those that gives you all the little short cuts and promises you can \"out-smart\" Amazon. Instead, it's practical advice that's been broken into bite-sized portions for easy digestion.  It's designed to work through one hour at a time and depending on where you are now you should begin to see some results within a few days.  I think it's wonderful that you may see more immediate results, but the book was designed to help you build consistency in your business.If you have any questions please contact me...I'm not hard to find!Tammie", "related": ["B004DNWQ98"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 39.0}

Having ghostwritten several e-books on behalf of clients I decided to start writing and publishing books under my own name. The idea for \"Kids' Clubs and Organizations - A Comprehensive UK Guide\" was first conceived more than 10 years ago. My own kids were toddlers at the time and I noticed that there was a growing trend for parents to get their kids involved in all kinds of after school activities. I felt that it would be useful to provide something that parents and carers could refer to in order to find information about suitable kids' clubs and activities in their regions. The book has already been well received since the launch of the Kindle version with a number of positive reviews on parenting websites and magazines. I intend to follow this book with other books on parenting topics in the near future. Long term I plan to publish novels and have already written my first, a crime thriller, which I hope to publish in early 2013. To receive regular updates regarding my books please visit the book page of my website at: http://www.dianemannion.co.uk/books.html or my facebook page at: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Diane-Mannion-Writing-Services/285019144850839.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite the horrific ordeal, Ms. Kemp found it in her heart to forgive her estranged husband. Although Ms. Kemp had a love for God early on, it wasn't until her middle years that the love for God began to manifest itself in her life. In her formative years, a seed was planted (introduction to God). In her early adult years the seed was watered. And now in her midlife years, the seed had begun to grow. As you journey through these pages you will witness the underlying force that propelled Ms. Kemp to persevere despite the odds stacked against her.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How shocking could I make that? What bizarre scenario could I come up with that no one would suspect? The Prologue was added later to tie the whole scenario together and close the loop as it were. Some will find it an effective teaser as well. Having lived in the Boston area, I have placed most of the action in that setting.

This is a book you will want to pull out again and again . . . -Fundinmental Adjectives that come to mind are sweet, poignant, cute, sad, bittersweet, etc. The reason for this variety of emotions is because this is an anthology and there are a variety of story types. . . these are stories of love, but no, they aren't about one kind of love. I think I was most taken by the ones that weren't about romantic love though there are some good samples of that included too. I particularly enjoyed the smooth narrative tones of these stories both from a first person and third person perspective. -Sophia Rose, Guest Reviewer for Delighted Reader This book along with its beautiful love stories gives you lessons as well. Jaye Frances did a beautiful job of bringing together these short, yet powerful stories of love, showing us every side of it. I highly recommend this book of short stories that will surely warm you heart and bring a smile to your face. -TwoGirlsReading The one thing that ties every one of these stories together is Love. Keeping love, finding love, maintaining love, love in all of its forms and shown in many different ways. And who doesn't LOVE love? Really? Filled with the writing the author is known for, these smoothly crafted and supremely touching stories each have a moment of resonance with all readers. -The Jeep Diva", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unable to get police help, he buries her secretly. His dream is to join his long-absent mother in the paradise of New York City, but she does not answer his calls, and his cell phone is dying. The officials ignore him; in fact, he witnesses unspeakable official violence and cover-ups while visitors bask in the tropical sun. With sharp wit, the boy’s viewpoint reveals darkness behind the glamorous images of the Caribbean: “Tourism was the process of selling illusions to foreigners.” Just as revealing are the small acts of kindness by the struggling local people. Shango puts up mangoes for sale at his grandmother’s fruit stall, and everyone leaves him the money when he is away. Right up until the shocking ending, readers will be held by both the grim reality and the hope. --Hazel Rochman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Joe, a professional poker player on the run after gunning down a mayor’s son (in self-defense), meets a woman whose late father had been appointed the new judge of Gold Butte. The woman convinces our hero that he should impersonate the dead man, and suddenly Joe is sitting on the bench, trying to act like he knows what he’s doing. And, if trying to keep the townspeople from getting wise to the scheme isn’t hard enough, it isn’t long before trouble shows up, in the form of men who want to give Joe his comeuppance for killing the mayor’s son back home. It’s a story of a basically good man trying to do the right thing, which would be easy enough if the right thing didn’t keep turning out to have such awful consequences. Bowers keeps the proceedings light, but he never turns the novel into an outright comedy. This isn’t Blazing Saddles, but it is a fun, lighthearted western with colorful characters and plenty of atmosphere. --David Pitt", "related": ["B009MSJXWC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But I knew it was down there. And so, inspired by the many brilliant writers who have gone before me, encouraged and supported by my team of beta readers and propped up on countless late nights by enormous volumes of coffee, I gradually honed the appropriate tools, discarding those that produced nothing but smashed thumbs.My excavation of The Ascent of PJ Marshall has been a life-changing experience, and I have loved every mud-caked, raw-knuckled moment.

It was a much more difficult area to work in than I was used to and I eventually gave it up. Now I could retire - how wrong could I be? About this time, I met a wonderful, disabled lady who needed care, so began to work for her on a part-time basis. This person is author, Sallyann Sheridan. At the time, she was involved in writing workshops and I would act as her assistant. She then set up a writing group in the local village; again, I helped out, but eventually taking part myself. We would write short stories, but I could never get excited about them. I suddenly had the urge to write a book. Several months went by, with me not knowing what to write. Then I read an article written by Penny Vincenzi on how to create a storyline and a story began to grow in my mind. The rest as they say is history. My first novel Every Why was published as an ebook on Amazon in March 2012, closely followed by the sequel, Be Mindful in December 2012. My third novel is two-thirds of the way finished and I have several more ideas swirling round in my head waiting for their entrance into the world. I never could have envisaged the direction my life would take me. I never would have believed that there aren’t enough hours in the day to do all I want to do.

I currently serve on the editorial boards of two national trade journals and have written more than two hundred educational and informative articles for the popular press. I live with my wife and two cats (or is it the other way around?) in southeastern Idaho, where most of the potatoes are. An irresistible compulsion just a few years ago to get back into writing science fiction resulted in \"The Scrapyard Incident.\" Maybe the theme of the book would make more sense if I admitted to having an inexplicable interest in junkyards too...

I am currently working on the second book of the \"Junkyard Dogs\" saga which will be entitled \"The Veritian Derelict.\" I hope to have it available by this summer. We'll see if my muse behaves.

My name is Thomas Miller and I'm glad that you have find your way to my photo recipe cookbook!  I hope you will grab it, like it and find it useful! Of course, I also hope it will help you to prepare some really amazing and tasteful dishes for yourself, your family and friends!  First of all, I'm not a professional chef. Not even close, and I want to make that clear. To tell you frankly, I'm 31 year old guy who for 30 years didn't know how to prepare anything more than an egg! But then I've begin to study recipes and spent a lot of time in the kitchen trying to turn them into delicious meals.  When I finally made it and actually prepared something eatable, I've decided to share my new hobby and knowledge with everyone else, including you.  Why? Because I knew that there are many other people, both male and female, who don't know how to cook or prepare particular meals. I knew that my experience could help them, and that's why I've decided to create these little recipes for particular meals that I love to prepare in my own kitchen.  However, I knew that I can't just throw in bunch of recipes and say \"Here, follow these!\", so I've decided to take another step and prepare these detailed step-by-step recipes so everyone can see how to prepare particular meals and desserts.  Also, I was trying to impress my girlfriend. And I must say, after she tried my meals, she was all mine. Probably because most of them were prepared for her, or to be exact, for both of us to enjoy in them.  I think these detailed step-by-step photo recipes are extremely simple to follow, well detailed and very helpful with all those photos... In my opinion anyone can follow these easy steps and be able to prepare delicious meals and desserts!  I hope you will enjoy in delicious dishes described in this photo cookbook. If you like how I create my photo recipes, I'm inviting you to visit my website - www.HisRecipes.com - where you can find even more detailed recipes like this one, video recipes, quick short recipes, tips & tricks about cooking, interesting articles and much more!  I hope to see you on my website!  Deliciously yours, Thomas Miller", "related": [], "rank": 3302499, "title": "Spring Soup, Chicken With Pasta, Tortillas & Chocolate Crinkles : Detailed Step-By-Step Photo Cookbook (Complete Meals Series 1)", "author": "Thomas Miller", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the truck. After speaking with this lady about it, I decided that I couldn't just walk away from it. I quietly walked over to the skunk, positioned myself in front of it, and then bent down. I reminded the skunk that I was a friend and that I was there to help it out. After saying this, I gently put my hand on it's back, while pulling the can as lightly as possible. After a couple of tries, the can came off it's head. The skunk and I both looked at each other, and I said, “We're good right?” While saying this this I slowly lifted myself up and repeated what I had just said. The skunk and I both turned and went our ways with no incidence. Life inspires me. The one thing that drives me, is the need to create. I believe that I can use my talents and abilities to create a better world for others, and so the creations will continue for a long time to come.", "related": ["B008Y0YVM6"], "rank": 4398061, "title": "A New Beginning eBook", "author": "Troy Davis", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Right from the very first chapter I was hooked. I was at a point that I just couldn't wait for my break or my lunch at work so I could find out what was going to happen next,  and the best part was the anticipation in between readings. Not many writers can hold my attention like that and for a debut novelist that doesn't happen very often with me.For a debut novel this was very very impressive. Lisa's characters were a joy to spend time with, even the despicable ones. The pacing was extraordinary, the twists and turns will take your breath away.--Peter Schwotzer, Literary MayhemLisa Von Biela gives the reader a fast-paced techno-thriller that opens quickly and just draws you right along for the ride and does not let up until the last couple pages (almost 300 solid pages of action).  The characters are very likeable and real and the reader can instantly sympathize with them.  The corporate enemy is also something that almost everyone can relate to as almost everyone has wondered at one time or another about what their employer does behind closed doors.  While there were some technical aspects about computers and programming in the story, it was light enough to not bog down the action or lose the reader.  Von Biela shows that she knows how to flesh out a story while still keeping it heading forward at breakneck speed.\"The Genesis code\" is another great production by Darkfuse and Lisa Von Biela is definitely an author that I will keep an eye out for in the future.  This book is scheduled for a May release and I would recommend that everyone keep an eye out for this one.  It is definitely not to be missed.--Josef Hernandez, Minneapolis Books Examiner", "related": ["B00H6YCGDM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 45.0}

But a camping trip to a remote American Indian Reservation will place her in the middle of a Werewolf Full Moon Run. The Pack isn't expecting to discover a beautiful curvy woman alone in such an isolated place. This encounter introduces Bree to a supernatural world in conflict with all of her years of scientific training. Bree's instant and mutual attraction to Mikah, who goes furry once a month, will leave her breathless.After meeting Bree, The Pack isn't expecting to later discover a second beautiful, curvy woman, yet they are more than willing to introduce her to their savage sexual ways. But Delia has been looking for The Pack because she has something else in mind for them: she loves the idea of playing rough with werewolf boy toys - especially since they heal so quicklyThe question is--can a Pack of passionate werewolves survive Bree and her sassy sister? Warning: This 32,000 word novella is so steamy it may fog up your Kindle. It contains explicit sex between a pack of werewolves and two curvy girls. Adult themes include rough werewolf BBW sex, a heavy duty Domme who enjoys BDSM without safe words and a passionate romance between a pretty, plus-size girl and a werewolf. Note: This is the novelization of all the previously published stories about Bree, a proud and confident BBW, Mikah of the wolves, and her amazing sister Delia. It is intended for mature audiences 18+.EXCERPT:He grinned at me. \"I like you. What's your name?\"\"Breeanna Cunningham--but everyone calls me Bree.\"\"Like that soft cheese,\" Mikah sighed. \"You look so soft. You look so pretty.\" He caressed the skin of my thighs, and I felt as if my Pixielator had just gotten plugged into a 220 volt socket. He raised himself up a bit, giving him better access to lightly touch me. \"So soft,\" he said again. He rubbed his face against my thigh the way Mr. Wiggins scrapes his mouth against me every morning when I get ready to set his bowl down. My vet explained it was the one of the ways a cat marked territory. I only hoped Mikah didn't decide to mark territory by peeing. I'll admit to a few kinks, but golden showers isn't one of them.He took my right hand in his and lightly kissed it. He looked up and smiled widely, as if he were convinced he had done something very clever. He went back and began massaging me. I moved slightly to give him more space, which meant I ended up lying down on my back. He apparently took that as an invitation to start exploring my body. \"I'm so glad I found you, Bree Cunningham.\"", "related": ["B00IA9LMF0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 2.4444, "rating_total": 22.0}

Father John, sent to what was once Northern Africa, labors gamely to heal the sick and bring the word of Christ into the lives of the pagan Borderers, natives forced to live outside the boundaries of European civilization. Noting that a large number of the natives are dying of the same disease, myeloid leukemia, he starts to investigate a native plant that the people use as an intoxicant. Although banning the koyil leaf would seem to be a logical solution to reducing the large number of deaths, Father John encounters realpolitik, which dictates that moral decisions are secondary to maintaining the status quo. Father John's life is complicated by nagging doubts about the validity of his faith and his attraction to a Borderer woman. MacLeod's somewhat bleak vision of the future is energized by his evocative writing and his ability to create realistic characters who struggle mightily with questions of belief, love, life, and death.-?Nancy Pearl, Washington Ctr. for the Book, SeattleCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Strong, high-spirited, and often reckless, 15-year-old Jeremiah can't wait to lie about his age and enlist for adventure and glory, once he shepherds his younger siblings, Joshua and Mattie, safely away from their alcoholic, violent stepfather. Careful, introspective Josh, just 13, is unsure about the war, but knows he must keep the deathbed promise he made to his mother to watch out for Jere, no matter what. Leaving Mattie with a loving aunt and uncle in Rochester, the brothers find a company of volunteers to swear in Jere as a soldier and Josh as a drummer boy. When the training is over and the company joins General Meade's Fifth Corps in Virginia, the boys encounter the reality of combat all too soon. Suddenly alone and surrounded by blood and tragedy, Josh must grow up quickly and decide his views on war while in the midst of it. The story unfolds in a tight narrative that will hold readers' interest, and Josh's character development is both believable and touching. Historical details are accurate; anyone who has visited Civil War battle sites will find the experiences at Little Round Top and The Wilderness as convincing as they are exciting.Starr E.

Some of these I make almost every day, others I used years ago when I was younger and had problems with acne. So, naturally, when I began writing down the recipes I started checking the ingredients and proportions again, applying and trying them on my skin. Gradually, I stopped buying and using commercial scrubs and facial exfoliants and a funny thing happened - for more than 6 months I have not used on my skin anything that I cannot eat. The truth is I just don't need anything else. It is amazing what you can do with simple staple foods available in your kitchen - my skin feels great, clean and soft. I have absolutely no reason to think natural skin care is not enough for me. Now, for some people this may sound a little strange and extreme, but I discovered that after going completely chemical-free, my skin is looking younger, fresher, and definitely healthier.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

Sophia Armitage had some significant decisions to make about how she was going to handle her future and who was going to be in control of it. K.T. Bowes tells the story of what ought to be a somewhat normal twelfth year for a teen at an inner city New Zealand high school, which is suddenly ripped apart by the disappearance of Sophia's mother, leaving Sophia and her father alone. Added to that drama, which has caused her to distance herself from her friends and her only protection from the \"plastics,\" a mean set of girls who had already beaten her up in ninth year, is the new friendship that she has developed with Dane. Dane is from the \"wrong side of the tracks,\" but the line that the tracks forms in order to divide the two becomes more and more dim as she comes to realize the truth about Dane.   K.T. Bowes has written an excellent beginning to a series that is sure to be exciting and full of drama in Free From the Tracks: The Teen Mayhem Series Book 1. The action and drama is all too real as Dane and Sophia navigate their way through crippling circumstances that challenge the depths of their strength as they are forced to press forward practically alone. The reader will feel the depth of emotion and the struggle that each of them faces as they work out their challenges, both separately and together. Deep, realistic and in many ways inspiring, Free From the Tracks: The Teen Mayhem Series Book 1 is not only a fantastic coming of age novel on its own, but a great beginning to a promising series.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": 3406, "title": "Free from the Tracks", "author": "K T Bowes", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

He also worked with community leaders, educators and businesses, developing new academic programs such as an innovative aviation and aerospace program designed for K-12 students and teachers, which included a partnership with NASA. As a professor, he thrived on learning and improving himself through reading and study, by attending conferences and seminars, presenting papers and lectures about teaching and learning, and technology. In 1990, he was selected by the State of Illinois to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, to help college technology teachers be more effective in their classrooms.

He is a father of six and at this writing, Papa to eight beautiful grandchildren.

She knows she’s living a luxurious life, yet sometimes feels trapped by the expectations that go along with it. When Francesca first meets Count Philippe de la Croix, he turns her head. But then an old friend, Alfred Finley, returns to the society that scorned him years ago. A summer in Newport, with its sequence of balls and cotillions, pits both men in a quest for Francesca’s hand. But what role does love and honor play when Francesca’s mother has her own agenda for her daughter to become a countess? As Alfred tries to repair his reputation and launch his humanitarian foundation, he learns that the count hides a secret. Can Alfred prove his worth and the count’s deceit before it’s too late?  “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”Jeremiah 29:11", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ms. Feldstein brilliantly demonstrates the ways these women, their images and performance strategies animated transformative struggles for social change.\" -New York Times\"Feldstein's time-capsule views of Greenwich Village and Harlem in the late 1950s and early '60s are fascinating, as is the roster of performers she introduces from the realms of jazz, folk, theater and cinema.\" --Dallas Morning News\"Feldstein shows how these women's actions promoted, interacted with, and anticipated both black power and second-wave feminism. Many of the battles discussed are still being fought by contemporary black artists, and Feldstein's investigation provides valuable context for the ongoing struggle, 'render[ing] these social movements in all of their messy complexity and richness.' --Publishers Weekly\"By placing black female musicians and actors at the center of Civil Rights history, Ruth Feldstein has written a tremendously important study that challenges readers to consider the imaginative activism of artists who performed progressive representations of black womanhood.How It Feels to BeFreetakes readers on a critical journey across the mid-twentieth century freedom struggle by way of women performers who rehearsed, remixed, and renegotiated civil rights and black power politics, as well as emergent feminisms... Feldstein places their lives and careers in conversation with one another and, in doing so, recuperates the crucial role that black women of music, film and television played in transforming our contemporary world.\"--Daphne Brooks, Princeton University\"In this meticulously researched and brilliantly argued study, Feldstein shows how black women entertainers expanded the very meaning of politics as they performed, contested, and reshaped race and gender at the dynamic intersection of the civil rights movement, culture industries, and global mass culture.  This stunning reinterpretation of women, gender, and the civil rights movement is essential reading for anyone interested in feminism, black activism, and the transnational cultural and political dimensions of 1950s and 1960s U.S history.\" --Penny M. Von Eschen, author ofSatchmo Blows Upthe World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War\"How It Feels to Be Freestands out as an enormous act of historical recovery. Ruth Feldstein masterfully illuminates the way in which black women entertainers actively participated in the civil rights struggle and helped to transform American and international race relations. A powerful and thought provoking book that will change the way we look at gender, civil rights, and the black freedom movement.\" --Peniel E.

A collection of distinguished colleagues examine a cluster of everyday, ubiquitously experienced fears - of dark and violent places within us, of breakdown, aloneness, injury, and death. It also looks at the most troubling, paradoxical fears: of intimacy and of success. Like anxiety, fear of a conscious experience opens the door to our patients' psychodynamics and conflicts; it points the way. As we have come to expect of him, Salman Akhtar again, wisely, enlarges our understanding of what so interferes with our patients' well-being.' - Henri Parens, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Thomas Jefferson University; training and supervising analyst, Psychoanalytic Center of Philadelphia 'Salman Akhtar has once again produced a book filled with his unique blend of scholarship, humanity, humour, and integrity. In the introductory chapter entitled \"Fear, Phobia, and Cowardice\", he asks, \"Is fear to be avoided at all costs or can this bitter gourd of emotion be transformed into a sweet mango of cultural delight?\" He goes on to treat the reader with a masterly and eloquent synthesis of psychoanalytic knowledge and ideas, richly illustrated by his own clinical examples and reflections. The subsequent chapters, designated \"The Six Main Fears of our Lives\", are carefully chosen, with each contributor providing an invaluable addition to the literature.' - Julian Stern, MD, Consultant Psychiatrist in Psychotherapy and Head of Psychiatry, Adult Department, Tavistock Centre, London", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She moved on to espionage on the threshold of her teens and was partial to Alistair MacLean--Seawitch is still her favorite novel by this author.  Shortly after stepping into espionage, Brigette discovered the romance genre, and followed faithfully authors like Janet Dailey and Anne Mather.  She never graduated from romance novels, and played loosely with the idea of writing her own one day. One day came during her mom-at-home years with her four children.  Now a Christian, Brigette wanted to capture the beauty of romantic tales through the eyes of faith.  From her first story, A Man Apart, Brigette crafts heroes and heroines who claim Christ but who are colored by the effects of sin.  What does that mean?  It means that she writes about real people with real emotions who live in the real world.  That means her characters lose their cool sometimes and say hurtful things.  Yet they catch themselves, sometimes later rather than sooner, apologize and ask forgiveness of both man and God.  At times they struggle with hatred and travel the long road to letting go and filling their hearts with love instead.  And when it comes to love and affection, her characters are expressive within parameters of course.  You will find touches, hugs, and lots of kisses in Brigette's novels, and if the couple is married, Brigette believes in expressing their intimacy without putting everything on the page.  Romance, Christian romance is what she writes as well as Christian Romantic suspense for those readers who like a more adventure-filled and suspenseful read. To date Brigette has penned two romantic suspenses:  Against His Will and Tropical Eyewitness (Books I and II respectively in The Banning Island Book Series). She has written seven Christian romance novels:  A Man Apart and the sequel, Forever With You (Part of the Mahogany and Daniel Series).  From Passion to Pleasure, Once in This Lifetime, and Someone Like You (Books I-III respectively in the Five Brother's Book Series--two more stories to come).  And in the Seneca Mountain Series, Brigette has written thus far A Fall for Grace and A Price Too High (Books I and II respectively of this series)", "related": ["B0094GWD7E"], "rank": 1177496, "title": "Tropical Eyewitness (The Banning Island Romances Book 2)", "author": "Brigette Manie", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Richmond decided he wanted to become a journalist, but Reality intervened and gave him a bout with cancer, forcing him to drop out of school. Oh, he and Reality laughed and laughed over that one. Undeterred, Richmond then decided he wanted to become a comic book artist, which assured him a moneyless future and standing in breadlines. He spent three years in New Jersey earning his degree and was hired as a professional inker on such titles as Mortal Kombat and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Reality then drove by his new apartment and took a dump on his lawn, causing his comic book company to be bought out and everyone to be fired. During this time, Richmond went back to school for multimedia design and also created, illustrated, and wrote two successfully published comic strips, cementing in him a love of humor writing and absurdist comedy. Finally fed up, Richmond went and punched Reality in her big fat face, resulting in one of his comic strips being briefly picked up by a syndicate. Richmond stood firm against Reality’s advances and was then hired by the federal government as a multimedia designer, where he still works today. Reality and Richmond have now entered an uneasy relationship involving sloppy hookups and the occasional drunk sexting.", "related": ["B00IP1ZFXS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
