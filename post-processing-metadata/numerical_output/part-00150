Marley Zimmerman, 14, is jolted from a daydream in her boring math class when she and her friend Marisol are summoned to the vice principal's office. Marisol is accused of stealing a rare violin from a Juilliard display. Even though the theft is caught on videotape, Marisol denies all knowledge of it, and Marley is convinced that her friend, a talented violinist, would never take such a rare instrument. Soon Marley and her friends, members of a new and mostly unrehearsed band called the Kingston Cowboys, are on the case. The teens move across a New York City backdrop that incorporates locales such as the Zimmermans' brownstone, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Central Park, hunting clues and gathering suspects. Unshakable in her conviction of Marisol's innocence, intrepid Marley employs all of her abilities and resources to save her friend. Marley is a fully drawn character, and the supporting cast members are developed well enough to make them compelling and interesting.

Happily her manuscript has now been declassified and is available to the public.”–Ezra F.

The key to the mystery of the 'Hermit Kingdom' is now in print.”–From the foreword by Stephen J.

This was because I did not know about Helen-Louise Hunter's seminal study, Kim Il- song's North Korea.

The late-summer sun baked the normally lush land of Australia's Upper Hunter Valley, but the heat did not seem to touch him. He stood with uncanny ease despite his size, concealing the intense focus that simmered beneath the surface. A mere passerby would never know someone wanted him dead.\"Came in the mail, just like the first one.\" With a foot perched on the bottom rail of a freshly painted white fence, Tyler Preston looked from the newsprint his trainer had just handed him to the gorgeous Thoroughbred in the pasture. Lightning Chaser grazed quietly, as he always did, but Tyler knew the horse too well to fall for the illusion. He'd helped deliver the colt one damp spring night three years before. He'd been there when the big mare went into distress. He'd gone down on his knees and helped her through her delivery. He'd been the first to see the foal.The first one to…know.Even then, in the first minutes following birth, Lightning Chaser had been tall, with the kind of presence a gangly newborn rarely possessed. There in the brightly lit barn, he'd lifted his head and shown off his blaze, and Tyler had rocked back on his haunches and… known.This wasthehorse.It was a big dream, an even bigger responsibility to heap on one so young, but big dreams and big responsibilities were something Tyler knew well. He'd been given the dream by his father. He'd blown the responsibility all by himself.It was up to him to restore Lochlain Racing to the respectability he'd trashed through one careless mistake.And Lightning Chaser was the horse to do it.The big bay colt stood benignly in the shadow of that lone tree, ears perked, tail swishing rhythmically. In three years they'd come far. As a two-year-old, Lightning had burned up the track, garnering seven wins to only two losses. He'd come on strong at the prestigious Queensland Stakes, pulling away from the pack and engaging the favorite in a thrilling dash for the finish.More Than All That had crossed first.Tyler had been disappointed, but had set his sights on the upcoming Outback Classic—until his trainer had walked into his office the following morning. More Than All That had been disqualified. Steroids had been detected in his blood. Lightning Chaser, who'd run a close second, was named the official winner.The racing community reeled. Allegations of fraud in the sport, quiet since the mysterious death of another racehorse, resurfaced. Everyone had their own opinion about who'd doped Sam Whittleson's horse—and why.Tyler's name had been on just about every short list.An ocean away, in America, another branch of the Preston family had been going through an equally nasty scandal.That's why his cousin Andrew, one of the Kentucky Prestons, had decided to run for presidency of the International Thoroughbred Racing Federation. To restore dignity to the Preston name—and integrity to the sport of kings.With a twist to his gut, Tyler glanced down at the bold words scrawled atop the picture of Lightning Chaser. \"Unmarked envelope?\"Daniel Whittleson nodded. \"Just like the one my father received.\"The two had known each other since they were boys, when Daniel's father had worked as a trainer at Lochlain. Sam had gone on to travel the world, eventually returning to Australia, where he'd fulfilled his dream of opening his own stables.Daniel had stayed in America, working for Tyler's uncle until eight months before, when he'd finally come home after a dispute over water rights had landed his father in the hospital.\"How's he holding up?\" Tyler asked.\"Still drinking more than I would like.\" A quietly serious man, Daniel looked off in the distance, where beyond the drought-parched hills, his father's property lay. \"I'm not sure he's ever going to get over losing the Queensland.\"It had been awkward. Daniel, Sam Whittleson's own son, had returned to Australia to take over the training of Lightning Chaser. The racing community had had a field day with Daniel's so-called desertion of his father. And though his friend seemed impervious to the criticism, Tyler knew it burned.\"No one really believes he drugged his own horse,\" Tyler said. Sam would have had to have been crazy to do so. Not only was he guaranteed getting caught, but More Than All That had been a favorite. The horse could have won easily without the aid of an illegal substance.But that was a chance someone hadn't been willing to take.\"I know that,\" Daniel said, squinting against the glare of the sun. Over three weeks had passed since the last rain, and that had only been a few drops. \"And rationally he does, too. But…\"The words trailed off. Both men knew. Much like the impact of the drought on the land, the damage had been done. Sam's name had been smeared. His stables were tainted.It was a situation Tyler knew well.\"He'll rebound,\" he predicted. That's what his own father had promised him six years ago. They'd stood just inside Lochlain's newly completed state-of-the-art barn. But instead of colts and fillies shuffling in their stalls, there'd been only the smell of hay and tack, and the sound of silence. In the parking area beyond the paddock, the banker had been sliding from his dust-covered sedan.The word foreclosure had stuck in Tyler's gut.One mistake, that's all it had taken. One lapse in judgment. One touch—Tara.His mouth flattened. Letting out a rough breath, he focused on Lightning Chaser, standing tall and proud in the hot breeze. But he saw her anyway, as she'd been that very first time, that very first night—the straight, sunshine-blond hair and sparkling blue eyes, the wide, teasing mouth. Smiling, laughing. Lying.The memory seared.Shoving it aside, Tyler lowered the brim of his bush hat and turned toward Daniel. \"It just takes time.\"And distance.\"I talked him into going on safari,\" Daniel said. \"Bought the tickets and took him to Sydney last night. His plane left a couple of hours ago, at ten, I think.\"\"Well, there you go. That should be—\" Tyler stopped, Daniel's words registering. \"A couple of hours?\" Glancing at the watch his father had given him on his eighteenth birthday, a watch that had been in the Preston family for generations, he swore softly.He'd completely lost track of time.\"Late?\" Daniel asked.\"Andrew's campaign manager.\" She'd cooked up some big gala fund-raiser at Lochlain for the night after the upcoming Outback Classic. With that date closing in on them, she'd insisted they needed to meet in person to finalize details. Tyler didn't much care about invitations or napkins, but he did care about his cousin. And horse racing. And if the fund-raiser could help Andrew garner Aussie support, then Tyler would do his part. His cousin had been staying at Lochlain since arriving in Australia, using the stud as his base of operations.The last thing they needed was the Australian candidate, media mogul Jackson \"Jacko\" Bullock, winning.\"We were supposed to meet at one.\" It was now one-thirty.\"I'll finish up with Lightning,\" Daniel offered.\"Thanks, mate,\" Tyler said, glancing toward Midnight Magic, the sleek black horse Daniel had raced out to the back pasture. Taking the reins, he slipped his foot into the stirrup and swung his leg over the horse's back.\"Wish me luck,\" he muttered, then with a gentle nudge to the horse's sides, put the animal into a lope toward the main complex.A few white clouds drifted across the western horizon, but Tyler knew they would not bring rain. His pop had taught him that, how to tell which clouds brought rain and which only teased, just as David Preston had taught his son how to run a stud farm. The son of an Irish horseman, David had tried to pass on all that his own father had taught him, but Tyler had needed little teaching. He'd been riding before he'd started running.It was in the blood, David had decided. His eldest son had received the Preston horse gene. His younger, Shane, had not.With the blistering sun beating down on him, Tyler urged Midnight Magic toward one of the three barns on the far side of the paddock. A fourth was under construction. The mares and new foals had claim to the largest structure. His two- and three-year-olds occupied the middle building. The third, original structure, was used primarily for Loch-lain's boarding business.The buzz of activity intensified as he approached. Most of the training was done for the day, had taken place during the cooler hours before sunrise. But there was still work to be done, and like clockwork, young Heidi Hastings stood in the shade of several gum trees, feeding an apple to her little filly, Anthem. Her father didn't understand her fixation with the animal she'd sweet-talked him into buying, but Tyler suspected Heidi's frequent presence at Lochlain had as much to do with a certain groom hovering nearby as it did her interest in horses.\"Afternoon,\" he called as his three border collies bounded up to greet him. Carbine and Windbag were pushing ten, but they still thought they were as young as the pup, Tulloch.Heidi glanced up with a smile so bloody sweet, Tyler winced. Her father was a good man, but Tyler didn't know how any man could raise a kid alone, much less a young girl racing toward womanhood.\"I think something's wrong,\" she said, with worry both in her eyes and her voice. \"She doesn't want her apple.\"Tyler's chest tightened. Bloody hell—after the girl's mother abandoned them, Dylan Hastings had his hands more than full. \"Just the heat,\" Tyler said. The animals didn't like it any more than the humans did. They needed rain—badly. But with rain would come lightning, and with the land as parched as a sponge in dry rot, lightning could mean disaster.Just the week before, some bloke had tossed a cigarette out the car window, and before the sun had set, more than a hundred acres of bush had been scorched. Two national parks had been lost.\"Try this,\" he added, pulling a couple of peppermints from his back pocket. He tossed them to her and winked. \"Anthem just nee...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But even if just one of them uses this book as a tool for introspection, the relationship—whether straight or gay—should greatly improve. Worksheets and exercises are included.

Soon after, fate intervened via a powerful personal query, launching him on an odyssey of self-discovery and illumination that would take the next twenty years to complete. He searched with passion for the missing pieces to the ultimate cosmic puzzle. During physics lectures, the deep ramifications of Dr. von Heisenberg’s Principle of Uncertainty brought to light the concept that the eternal verities of life would remain forever beyond our reach. Dr. von Heisenberg defined a barrier beyond which it is stated: “You shall not pass.” In a flash of cognitive awareness, Mr. Allen saw the illusive state of absolute certainty—by definition—would never be achieved by humanity, if we continued to follow only the means of our present technology and its trajectory. While working on personal experiments toward the resolution of these thorny conundrums, Curtis Allen completed his degree and graduated cum laude from the University of the State of New York. Since then, he has held such positions as CEO for Neuroscience Industries, Inc.; CEO for Business Software Products Co. (a developer of early Windows-type technology) and President of the Strategic Learning Institute, Inc. Mr. Allen hosted the San Francisco based tele-vision show In the Mind's I, where he interviewed notables in physics, neuroscience and philosophy such as author-physicist Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, featured in the film \"What the Bleep do We Know? \". He was also the co-originator of Robot Wars (precursor to the television show, BattleBots). Mr. Allen has lectured for national organizations including MENSA, PC Clubs of America and the U. S. Department of Agriculture. He was awarded The John Templeton Foundation grant for Creative Research in Neurobiology for the development of a product utilizing complex electromagnetic waveforms for technologically assisted consciousness exploration.  He co-founded an independent publishing company whose books were sold to Time Warner Publications, HarperCollins, Allen & Unwin and Macmillan. Five of the books have since been translated and published in seventeen different languages.  Curtis Allen has had the good fortune to study at length with world-renowned leaders in the fields of science, spirituality, yoga and philosophy. Quantum Christ is destined to challenge positions and stimulate heated debate throughout the world and its aeny realms of thought.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So the setting in Texas was almost predetermined. Developing reasons why these two Texans would have anything to do with Mexico resulted in an espionage plot element. At first I meant for the female protagonist, Maeve Collinswood, to have her romance with the man she seeks to rescue, Zachary Duvall.Hamilton Jessup, the minor character who pretended to be her husband as a cover for her undercover spy activities suddenly became important as a part of the plot, however, and he grew into the \"romantic lead,\" as well as a fully developed hero in the storyline instead. This story required a lot of research and insertion of fictional characters into real events. Locations had to be close enough together to allow for the types of travel possible in the time period and within the relatively narrow constraints of the story's timeline. It revolves around the Battle of Monterrey, and even touches on the whole history of Texas' struggle for autonomy from Mexico. The plot revolves to some extent around a disability that is more than it first appears. How such disabilites were handled in this time period and how it would affect life in this place were points which I had to try to portray accurately. Conquering pride is a necessary element for both the main characters and gives an opportunity to explore the subject of alcoholism. Espionage always seems to involve lying, and some of the consequences of carrying that \"need to lie\" too far are explored.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": 1657551, "title": "Chasing the Texas Wind (The Fight for Texas Freedom Series Book 1)", "author": "Mary C.

No sooner has Shoe arrived in his old neighbourhood than he discovers that police are investigating a murder in the ravine near his home. And the murder victim is a man who lived in the neighbourhood 35 years earlier -- and who moved away while still a suspect in a series of rapes that occurred in the very ravine in which he was ultimately murdered.The police investigation, and Shoe's own inquiries, becomes intensely personal, as old friends, girlfriends, and even family members seem to have a connection to the murder victim, and reasons to want him dead.

As dean of the Howard Law School, he modeled the rigor and organization of Harvard Law School and the army to produce top-rated lawyers who committed their careers to overturning Jim Crow laws. One of his students was Thurgood Marshall. The book portrays the partnership of Houston (as legal theorist, strategist, and mentor), Thurgood Marshall (disciple), and Walter White (NAACP chief and financier), and other civil-rights lawyers. They repeatedly went before the U.S. Supreme Court and its affiliates to argue in favor of ending lynching, the poll tax, all-white juries, pay inequality, and unequal educational opportunity for blacks and whites. Younger readers will also learn about the systematic nature of the sacrifices made and the struggle for the U.S. to abide by its luminous promise to ensure safety and provide equal opportunity for all Americans.Very informative, serious, and easy to read. --Mohamed  Sherriff", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The purpose of writing this book is to help inform the average person who owns a personal computer how to protect oneself from identity theft. By exposing some of the dangers and risks involved with owning such an item, perhaps people could avoid going through a similar experience. The experiences documented in this book are meant to help instruct people about the use of computers. By understanding how they operate, it will help people see what they are capable of. Hopefully, people will be better equipped to protect their financial data as well as their personal lives. Although many people have good intentions with the use of their computers, there are some out there, who have bad thoughts and intentions. In fact, a hacker can turn a person's computer into a weapon without them knowing. In some cases, it could look like the victim committed the crime when in fact they had no knowledge of the crime that was being committed. Here are my hopes for the book.* Children--learn to protect yourself from the dangers of the Internet.  * Parents--use this book as a tool to engage your children in healthful conversation about the dangers, protect your privacy by monitoring your computer through different computer programs, take extra precautions by disconnecting external connections to your computer, and learn the signs of identity theft that you need to look for.  * Financial institutions--take extra precautions when hiring those who work at your institution, and protect the consumer by going the extra distance, and do not expect the consumer to pay for additional expenses when it is your job to serve them.  * Corporations, companies and small businesses--take back control of your business away from the greedy hands of this government.  * Military personnel, families of prisoners of war, and families of those who died for their country--learn about what you can trust from the government you serve.  * Media--do better research when reporting a story, including presenting both sides of the story, especially if it comes through the Associated Press!Although there may be men in powerful positions, this story is meant to give courage to those who may face similar insurmountable situations in their lives. It is also meant to expose the truth. Intuition, common sense, and plain old good investigating led to the arrests of most of those committing the crimes. However, two of the main people in this story have not been prosecuted yet. It is my determination and will that something be done to these criminals! Sometimes, hiding behind the guise of the \"witness protection program\" does not protect those who are in pursuit of the truth and justice, but it protects those who are trying to hide their sinister secrets instead. Those who are in the \"Domestic Spy Program\" are unwilling participants and lack the protection of their rights. Since I am under no contractual arrangements, which means that I was not in the \"witness protection program\" and never was with this government, I am free to tell my story. If I was truly being protected by them, they would have had to supply me with a written contract and told me what my rights were. Since they did not do this, I guess that means I was part of the \"Domestic Spy Program\", which was one of the over four thousand investigations that resulted from Operation Firewall. In a way, by the government not following their own rules and regulations, it has given me the freedom to tell my story. What started out as a conspiracy theory has ended up as the God-honest truth! After reading this book, you will be able to draw your own conclusions. You cannot believe everything you hear or see on the news since the government controls the propaganda that is filtered through the guise of the Associated Press. In addition, this book is dedicated to the many people including the investigators, law enforcement, agents, and undercover agents who were involved in the apprehension of these criminals. Thanks also go out to those within the government who were instrumental in creating new laws and passing them in order to charge them with the crimes. There are many victims who were involved in this case. This book is dedicated to all people who were victims of these crimes. Although some of the names and usernames as well as locations have been fictionalized in this book to protect those involved, the story is based on all written and preserved documentation of events. The usernames that are referred to in the story are NOT in use by any of the original people involved in this case. Hopefully, this book will serve as a vindication for all of our names and expose how the crimes were committed and who perpetrated them. Now here is the inside story of Operation Firewall as told Through Angela's Eye.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is the author ofBenjamin Franklin: An American Lifeand ofKissinger: A Biography, and the coauthor ofThe Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and daughter.David Brooks has written an absolutely fascinating book about how we form our emotions and character. Standing at the intersection of brain science and sociology, and writing with the wry wit of a James Thurber, he explores the unconscious mind and how it shapes the way we eat, love, live, vacation, and relate to other people. InThe Social Animal, he makes the recent revolution in neuroscience understandable, and he applies it to those things we have the most trouble knowing how to teach: What is the best way to build true relationships? How do we instill imaginative thinking? How do we develop our moral intuitions and wisdom and character? Brooks has always been a keen observer of the way we live. Now he takes us one layer down, to why we live that way.--Walter IsaacsonAn Amazon Interview with David BrooksWe talked with David Brooks about, among other things, Jonathan Franzen, Freud, and Brooks's own unfamiliar emotions, just before the publication ofThe Social Animal. You can read thefull interviewon Omnivoracious, the Amazon books blog, including this exchange:Amazon.com:Speaking of Tolstoy, I bet a lot of people are going to quoting the first line of Anna Karenina to you: \"Happy families are all alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Is there a consistency between what makes a family happy, the way that this family turns out to be?Brooks:You know, I never bought Tolstoy's line.Amazon.com:I didn't either.Brooks:I didn't know many happy families that were alike. One of the things you learn is that we're all so much more complex. We all contain multitudes, so someone who might be a bully in one circumstance is incredibly compassionate in other circumstances. We have multiple selves, and the idea that we can have a very simple view of who we are, what our character is, that's actually not right.One of the things all this research shows you is how humble you have to be in the face of the complexity of human nature. We've got a 100 billion neurons in the brain, and it's just phenomenally complicated. You take a little child who says, \"I'm a tiger,\" and pretends to be a tiger. Well that act of imagination--conflating this thing \"I\" with this thing \"tiger\"--is phenomenally complicated. No computer could ever do that, but it's happening below the level of awareness. It seems so easy to us. And so one of the things these people learn is they contain these hidden strengths, but at the same time they have to be consciously aware of how modest they can be in understanding themselves and proceed on that basis.A Letter from Author David Brooks© Josh Haner,The New York TimesSeveral years ago I did some reporting on why so many kids drop out of high school, despite all rational incentives. That took me quickly to studies of early childhood and research on brain formation. Once I started poking around that realm, I found that people who study the mind are giving us an entirely new perspective on who we are and what it takes to flourish.We’re used to a certain story of success, one that emphasizes getting good grades, getting the right job skills and making the right decisions. But these scientists were peering into the innermost mind and shedding light on the process one level down, in the realm of emotions, intuitions, perceptions, genetic dispositions and unconscious longings.I’ve spent several years with their work now, and it’s changed my perspective on everything. In this book, I try to take their various findings and weave them together into one story.This is not a science book. I don’t answer how the brain does things. I try to answer what it all means. I try to explain how these findings about the deepest recesses of our minds should change the way we see ourselves, raise our kids, conduct business, teach, manage our relationships and practice politics. This story is based on scientific research, but it is really about emotion, character, virtue and love. We’re not rational animals, or laboring animals; we’re social animals. We emerge out of relationships and live to bond with each other and connect to larger ideas.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After an early exit from high school, I was bronze foundry worker by day and art student by night, moving on to a GED, Wayne State University, and med school. Then came a family practice residency in Colorado, an alternative practice in Boulder, and a fellowship at UCLA. My partner lured me to her beloved NYC, where we had the second of three great kids, I taught for a few years, and was board certified in Preventive Medicine before dragging her back to this near-fictional isle in the great literal West. Currently, I hold a half-time position as a family doc, making it the world's best day job, a solid dose of life and patient care that leaves time to write (and, yes, a few healthy-lifestyle things that are fun enough to do but boring to read about, except - perhaps - in the context of a character-driven novel). Aside from a few published studies, I began my writing career with the Zen of Science column for Nexus, covering topics from sex to homeopathy, yoga, massage, meditation, acupuncture, social connectedness, and the psychology of cancer survival. A decade ago, I fell into fiction and have been addicted since. This led to the novels Resonance, Thrilling Romance, The Mortalist, a handful of short stories, and now, How To Live Forever. The last has been the best: the characters became friends, if rather odd ones, and I’ve been fascinated by aging and longevity since, well, forever.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.2, "rating_total": 16.0}

I understand where they're coming from, but I also know that it really doesn't have to be that way. Believe it or not, math is actually very cool. And that's exactly what all the visual explanations, puzzles, and games in this short e-book are designed to show you. The goal is to explain how real math works, why it's so awesome, and to hopefully convince people who think that math is awful to see that math is--dare I say it--elegant, fun, and even beautiful.A quick note to address a few concerns raised in the comments: This short e-book is indeed an excerpt from the prologue of my book The Math Dude's Quick and Dirty Guide to Algebra. Since the content of this e-book is really not about algebra, but is instead more of a philosophical look at math, I thought it would be of interest to a larger audience than just people interested in learning about algebra...which is why I've made it available separately. Of course, it's my hope that if you enjoy reading this e-book you'll also enjoy reading the algebra book (which contains a lot more information in its 500 pages--including solutions to all the problems!). But either way, I hope I convince you that math isn't an awful nerd.

Not only that, it encouraged me to think about the topics covered, and more importantly do my own research. Something I hope to achieve with my writing. A subject close to my heart is poverty and oppression in Africa, and I firmly believe that education is the key to breaking the cycle.

He was a sailor, an airman, a journalist, a travel courier, a cartoonist, and a history teacher. After turning to full-time writing, he wrote adventure stories, war novels, political thrillers, and also created a sequence of crime novels around the quirky French Chief Inspector Pel, centered primarily in Burgundy, but occasionally Paris and elsewhere. Harris was unusually versatile and wide ranging as an author. Epics such asChina Seasand the three trilogies written under the pseudonym Max Hennessy, along with African adventure novels, wide-ranging crime, mysteries, and historical fiction, all guarantee a library of diverse and entertaining reading full of dry wit and gripping prose.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": 1692442, "title": "The Bright Blue Sky", "author": "Max Hennessy", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His early years were devastating as he endured the divorce of his parents, the death of his beloved great-grandmother, and the resulting feelings of isolation and loneliness. While these events took their toll, they also shaped the man he grew up to be. Phil had a different perspective than his friends and his experiences were totally unique. As his young male friends were busy playing baseball, defending their turf, and hitting on girls, his time was spent reading, listening to music, writing his feelings down in his journal and trying to understand the differences in people and to figure out how “we can all get along.” After graduating early from high school, he entered the work force as a way to help support his mother and his siblings. To get away from the reality of his life, Phil spent much of his off time with his best friend, a lesbian. She was able to help him experience women at his own pace and taught him many of the lessons he was to put in place. As more and more straight ladies entered his life, these experiences allowed him to learn more about human nature and he was able to turn these special times into the stories in his book.  Phil lives in Nevada with his wife and their son. He mixes work with his love of writing. He spent the first 25 years of his working life in the restaurant industry. He took all the knowledge from his early days at McDonalds and parlayed that into a successful stint with Panera Bread. He rose from the day to day operations of a general manager to become an Area Manager and then a Training Manager for that organization. Teaching and speaking in front of hundreds of trainees day in and day out helped him perfect his easy going style. He is now an Area Manager for CDS, a marketing and sales firm which specializes in working with the vendors of Costco Wholesale Warehouses.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some are modest in nature; some are pie-in-the-sky, but all are hampered by all-too-familiar issues. Monique is an obituary writer but wants to be an investigative reporter. She has a houseful of abandoned pets, a slight weight problem, a tendency for fibbing; she can't cook, and lives next door to her meddling mother. Monique also would love to meet a good man, but has no intention of marrying until she's a success in her chosen field. Quirky Monique charges headlong into life and often gets into trouble. It doesn't help that her novel-writing mother corresponds online with prospective dating partners for Monique in the name of research. The first time she has a brush with the law, she meets hunky cop Jake Dube. Although he's very interested and they develop a steamy relationship, those pesky issues prevent Monique from giving her all. Warm and lighthearted, Amos' novel will charm readers with its vivid characters, especially the spirited and all-too human Monique.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

It serves two important purposes by providing both a thorough introduction to the specialty of geriatric psychiatry and an approachable, clinically focused treatise on the psychiatry of geriatrics.  This book steadfastly maintains its clinical focus and relevance, melding basic science, clinical research, and clinical experience.  These themes are tied to vignettes of clinical cases that make it all work.  The extensive range of subjects reflects the remarkable breadth of knowledge and experience of the editors and contributors.  Several often-neglected issues are addressed, including developmental stages of life, the importance of the caregiver, cultural influences, and forensics.  The introductory sections by themselves make the book well worth having.  This text is a wonderful exposition of the general issues associated with aging and the management of psychiatric disorders in geriatrics.\"  Psychiatric Times, 28-SEP-06 -- \"This is the latest clinical textbook in the field of geriatric psychiatry. There are 102 contributing authors, many of whom are experts in their field, who join the esteemed lead authors, Marc E. Agronin and Gabe J. Maletta. Chapter 8, provides an excellent, well-referenced review of neuroimaging findings in mild cognitive impairment, mood disorders, psychosis, and in the various dementias. Len Sperry's chapter on spirituality and its role in geriatric psychiatry is an outstanding addition, highlighting an often under-addressed facet of clinical care. Chapter 18, \"Ethical Issues in Geriatric Psychiatry,\" provides a thorough overview of capacity, informed consent, and advance directives that the practicing psychiatrist will find extremely useful. Section IV, on psychiatric disorders, is the largest part of this book and perhaps the most important for the clinician. This book's strength lies in its logical organization. Chapters are concise and easy to read. This book ably achieves its goal and is a wonderful contribution to the literature.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gutierrez: In 1997, Mario served in the United States Marine Corps. While on leave, he was arrested for committing a crime along with his brother Hugo. This incident spiraled a series of life changing events and marked the beginning of a  different life for Mario. In 2000, Mario was found guilty of the crime and was sentenced to five years in prison of which he served three due to good behavior. While incarcerated, Mario came to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and accepted Him as Lord and Savior of his life. A decision that would have never taken place had he never been incarcerated. Behind bars, Mario took a special interest in the story of David. He dissected the scriptures along with commentaries and books to gain a better understanding of it. It was there that, with no writing experience under his belt, but driven by a deep passion and creativity, he began to write the first chapters of his novel, The Mighty Men of King David. When Mario was released from prison, he joined the local fellowship at Templo Bautista Hispano in the City of Perris, CA.  He currently serves as a youth leader, Deacon, and sound director. He also serves at a local prison ministry. In 2007, Mario married Arleth Perez and they currently reside in Moreno Valley, CA. On April 9, 2012, Mario was granted a full pardon by the State of California.  Hugo E. Gutierrez: At age 18, Hugo became what society would consider \"scum.\" He was charged, found guilty, and ultimately sentenced to a California State Correctional Facility, where he is currently serving a 21-year sentence. During the first years of his incarceration, Hugo came to the feet of Jesus and accepted Him as Lord and Savior of his life. He understood that God had a better life for him, even behind bars. As co-author, Hugo is heavily involved in the editing process, character development, and structure of plot and story of the novel, The Mighty Men of King David. He and his brother Mario have developed an unconventional process in which Mario writes the rough drafts, mails them to Hugo in prison for editing, and finally makes the corrections indicated by Hugo when the edited copy is received in the mail. In prison, Hugo serves the Lord in both Spanish and English ministries. He encourages and teaches  prisoners that they can reach their full potential in life when they come to know Jesus as Lord and Savior no matter what their circumstances are. Hugo’s family eagerly awaits his release in 2016.", "related": [], "rank": 829224, "title": "The Mighty Men of King David", "author": "M.A. Gutierrez", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His amazing corporate profile took him from Manufacturing & Engineering Services to Human Resources to Logistics & Distribution to Sales and then Purchasing, where he earned the Senior Professional in Supply Management (SPSM) Certification coupled with outstanding work performance. With such a challenging and inspiring career path for a young engineer, he had an innate calling to find answers to questions like… Why do many people work very hard and stay broke… while a few work effortlessly and earn millions? Why do some people have it all… and others never seem to get past the starting blocks? Is there a real possibility that everything you and I have been taught about Great Performance and Prosperity is so far from the truth? In his quest for answers, Sylvester left his salaried position with Guinness-Diageo and got coached by a man who has been studying the mind, human potential and achievement for the past 50 years…his name is Bob Proctor, you might have seen him in the movie The Secret.  He then became a business partner of Bob and created his own Winning Habits Coaching, Job-getting Formula Coaching, and consulting businesses, to help people achieve their personal and professional goals.  Sylvester has given keynote speeches, seminars, and one-on-one and group coaching to thousands of salespeople and other corporate employees, institutions of learning and associations based on his licensed training programs with Bob Proctor's LifeSuccess Consulting, as well as his own powerful programs on getting a high-paying job in particular, and achieving wealth, health and happiness in general.   Inspired by his life’s challenges and experiences, coupled with his knowledge and experience of the POWER of Habits and the Mind in driving success, Sylvester is the Author of the “12 Habit Pillars” book entitled: Think Rich or Die Poor: Why Are Winners Always Attracting Riches… And The 12 Secret Habits You Must Develop If You Ever Want To Become A Winner! Sylvester's Interview on Meet the Experts with Arielle Ford about his book has been featured on ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX affiliates in the United States.", "related": [], "rank": 3947560, "title": "The Job-getting Formula - For The Experienced Worker", "author": "Sylvester Nkongho", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

David knows what the Germans did to his people in the recent war, but he thinks it’s unfair to blame the youth for what their parents did. (A)s a young man, he’s eager to see what the frauleins are like. His Jewish heritage fits prominently into the story, as it shapes his relationship with his Army peers, his supervisors, the women he commingles with and the landsmen he meets at synagogue and on a trip to Israel. (T)he novel is a sharp look at an enlistee in the peacetime Army. David is a smart, likable and fairly identifiable tour guide. David’s is a quieter tale, not one full of adventure and battle. (A)lthough he’s not jumping into foxholes or performing acts of heroism, it’s enjoyable spending time with him. The strongest scenes follow David as he travels around 1950s Europe and Israel, allowing readers to experience these places through the eyes of a Jewish kid from Brooklyn.

With an MS from Columbia Univ. Graduate School of Journalism and a J.D. from Fordham Law School, Lance spent the first 15 years of his career as a print reporter & network correspondent. Starting at The Newport, R.I. Daily News while a student at Northeastern University, he won the Sevellon Brown Award from the New England A.P. Managing Editors Association. Lance next moved to WNET, the PBS flagship in NYC, where he won his 1st NY area Emmy and the Ohio State Award as a producer-reporter. Later, at WABC-TV Lance won his 2nd NY & 1st national Emmys along with the RFK Journalism prize. While getting his J.D., Lance worked as a Trial Prep Asst. in the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Moving to ABC News, Lance won his 4th Emmy for his probe of an arson ring in Chicago. In 1981 Lance became Investigative Correspondent for ABC News; covering 100's of stories worldwide for 20/20, NIGHTLINE, and WORLD NEWS TONIGHT. He won his 5th Emmy for an investigation of unnecessary surgery in an Arkansas hospital. Then, in 1987, he came to L.A. and began working as a writer and story editor on CRIME STORY and MIAMI VICE for NBC. In 1989 Lance became \"show runner\" on WISEGUY for CBS and later co-created MISSING PERSONS for ABC. He later served as a writer and producer on JAG (NBC) and THE SENTINEL (UPN). In 1997 Lance's first novel FIRST DEGREE BURN was a national best seller. Later, he adapted VEIL: THE SECRET WARS OF THE CIA, Bob Woodward's book for HBO and TERROR.NET for Showtime. In 2000 Lance returned to investigative reporting with his best-selling biography: THE STINGRAY. Following the 9/11 attacks Lance began investigating the FBI's original probe of WTC bomber Ramzi Yousef. The result was his acclaimed 2003 investigative book from HarperCollins 1000 YEARS FOR REVENGE. Lance followed with 9/11 Commission COVER UP in 2004. In TRIPLE CROSS, the final book in Lance’s 9/11 investigative trilogy, he provided stunning evidence that senior FBI & DOJ officials may have obstructed justice in their failure to monitor Ali Mohamed, Osama bin Laden’s chief U.S. spy. In April, 2010 Lance was appointed Research Scholar at the Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies at UCSB. He writes regularly for PLAYBOY magazine and The Santa Barbara News Press. His new HarperCollins book SIX SIX SIX is due in 2012. STRANGER 456 is his second novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rather, it is a dish's flavors--sweet, sour, spicy, and salty--that must guide wine selection. Using this premise, Johnson-Bell, a wine journalist and panel judge, has written a handy guide explaining the tastes and aromas of wine and food and how this knowledge enhances the enjoyment of both. While much of the material has been seen before--e.g., charts of wine smells and varietals--this book makes excellent and unique contributions: a fairly exhaustive cross-referencing of wines and their perfect gastronomical partners (including cheeses and mushrooms), a table matching herbs and spices with wines, and the admission that, in the final analysis, champagne goes with anything. Useful for everyone from beginning oenophiles to restaurateurs, this is a highly recommended bargain for all collections.” (Library Journal)“Much has been written about the interrelationships between food and wine. Johnson-Bell approaches the subject from the perspective of a consumer for whom wine is the central focus. The point of matching foods to wines is primarily one of personal taste, but there are some general guidelines to prevent unpleasant clashing of flavors. As the author points out, the growing popularity of non-European cuisines has made food-wine matching even more problematic. Nevertheless, there are some thoughtful ways to go about picking a wine to accompany those enchiladas or that pad thai. Johnson-Bell writes clearly about how food flavors affect the way wine is perceived and vice versa. For those who want simply some prescriptive advice, this book offers long lists of foods matched to appropriate wines. Her tables of wine names and the grapes that go into them are also useful for reference.” (Booklist)“The superlative precision provided in Pairing Wine and Food should serve to blur the divisiveness often found between foodies and grape nuts. At its best, the palate game (played by both food and wine lovers) requires the most honed tasting skills backed by a prodigious memory. Johnson-Bell has contributed a splendid resource for the novice and expert.” (Foreword Magazine)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water; but, to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life. If I had my druthers, I would write all the time. In fact, that is pretty much what I do because I have reached a point in my life where it is now possible.All my work is non-fiction.

Charles Straight, a courageous pastor who preached boldly from his pulpit about HIV/AIDS in his African American community. The article dealt with life and death in the black community-- maybe the very survival of the community itself. It's a story about \"evolving\" and the courage it takes to help bring about evolution on gay rights. I deal with this selfsame issue in my new novel, THE REVEREND VIOLA FLOWERS (available at Amazon), where my heroine is conflicted about what position she and her church should take on this issue. Rev. Flowers suddenly becomes confronted with the most important question facing the Black Church since the days of Jim Crow: What should her stance be relative to the HIV/AIDS crisis? Every day her religious views are changing, but are they evolving fast enough for issues like homosexuality and same-sex marriage? If she gets involved in the struggle, would her evangelical congregation follow her? Will she find the faith and courage that Rev.

Flowers must deal with..THE REVEREND VIOLA FLOWERS is available for purchase in both eBook and paperback versions at Amazon. Com.

As she interviews the pretentious gallery owners and members of the art community, she uncovers a case awash in deceit and treachery. Could a handsome dealer with a reclusive client be involved? After a close brush with death following a date in Chinatown, Dixie is determined to get to the bottom of the story, but getting trapped in a warehouse fire and then getting stabbed suggest that these bad guys are definitely serious. With lots of action, colorful characters, and a surprising plot twist, this is an endearing series debut that will have readers eager for Dixie to solve more cases. --Barbara Bibel", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

E.L. James and Sylvia Day have done so much for the erotic romance genre and I do want to tip my hat to those authors. Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You have blazed a trail. Thank you, E.L. James and Sylvia Day from this author and all those who follow in your amazing footsteps.***About Knowing his Secret (Year of the Billionaire Vol. #1)I've always loved acting. I drew on my experiences in amateur theater for the setting where Tristan and Raina meet. A lot of people are surprised at how much talent can be found in Little Theaters. Even though folks don't get paid, they put a lot of effort and time into these productions. I thought that the setting would be a good way to keep the characters together without having them actuallyworktogether. For me, the apprentice and the big powerful boss is a plot line that's getting a bit worn.In creating the characters for Knowing his Secret, I wanted to craft believable people. I didn't want to take a cookie cutter image of a dominant billionaire and an innocent young woman. Tristan has his warts (of course, not the physical kind) and Raina is no pushover. As the series progresses, there is a subtle shift in the power dynamic. Even though the characters are larger than life, I wanted to reflect the kind of changes that naturally take place in a relationship over time.Attention to detail is one of my obsessions. I probably don't need to do as much research as I do for my books, but I want to make sure that you can get from point A to point B in fifteen minutes if I say you can. Particularly in part two of this series--Taking his Risk, I add quite a bit of background to the characters' little French vacation.", "related": ["B00IFCLO7I"], "rank": 3410, "title": "Knowing His Secret (Year of the Billionaire series Book 1)", "author": "K.C.

In due anni ci siamo sposati e ora abbiamo quattro bambini, un chihuahua e un siamese. La passione dei viaggi non è sfumata e appena possiamo, partiamo alla scoperta di un posto nuovo da visitare, usando anche la formula di home exchange. Mi piace avere sempre casa piena di amici e adoro cucinare. Spesso organizzo cene succulente da passare in compagnia.  Lettrice compulsiva, arrivo a divorare fino a sette libri a settimana, in inglese o in italiano. Non guardo televisione se non per le serie che seguo, esclusivamente in lingua originale. Adoro scrivere e lo faccio solo di notte, quando il silenzio e il buio mi permettono di entrare nel mio mondo di parole di carta e inchiostro.

Born in Java in 1917, Dutchman Erik hitch-hiked and rode the freights across the USA in the 1930's, then wrote his first best seller, 'Rendezvous in San Francisco'. As a law student at Leiden University when World War 2 broke out, he escaped to England but returned as an undercover agent for MI6, the British Secret Service. He later received the Dutch equivalent of the Medal of Honor, and served as aide to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands upon her return from England. Erik's postwar life was no less turbulent and spanned the globe. From sales clerk and actor in Hollywood to Director of Radio Free Europe, to oil prospector in Israel, he finally came to rest on the Big Island of Hawaii. In the words of acclaimed author Len Deighton, \"Erik has lived a hundred lives.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a wonderful read full of touching personal anecdotes. I personally found Jamelle's description of how she lost, and then \"found\", her Grandmother's wedding ring, as being a moving tale of sadness, guilt but with a wonderfully uplifting (actually astounding) ending.     In this book, Jamelle is your guide through such concepts as Zen, Gnosticism, Yoga and the mysteries of Ancient  Sumer. On every page I learned something new. But there was more. Forgive the pun but by the end ofSeeing ClearlyI was, indeed, also seeing clearly what Jamelle's intentions where in writingA Kindred Spirit. My interest was re-kindled and I went straight back to read the novel again.     I cannot stress how much I enjoyedSeeing Clearly. It is a book for anybody who finds it strange existing in a body located in a seemingly indifferent universe. It is a book that offers hope in the face of this indifference. Each one of us is special and we all have our place in the Greater Order of Things. This book will help its readers in doing what it says on the cover; see clearly, if only as far as the next step. But that is all we need. After all, the greatest journey starts with a single step, as Herman Hesse's character, Siddhartha, discovered.      ~ Anthony Peake, UK author, lecturer on consciousness, and a contributor toNew Dawn Magazine\"Ancient Wisdom/ New Thinking\"", "related": [], "rank": 2877878, "title": "Seeing Clearly", "author": "ej Morgan", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her parents divorced when she was a small child and for years she never knew her father. Growing up with her sister and living with her mother was an ongoing nightmare. She was victimized emotionally, physically, and sexually in an era when accessibility to Child Protective Services was not an option. Her perpetrators were her mother and her mother's lovers. There were other occasions when her older sister would also abuse her in the absence of any adults in the home. Victoria lived in silence regarding her abuse, believing that if she ever told anyone, she would suffer dire consequences. Victoria's abuse continued until she was 14 years old. After hundreds of hours of therapy and years of working several 12-step programs, Victoria now possesses the courage to tell her dramatic story. This is her full recollection of what happened back then. Today, Victoria counsels other survivors of childhood sexual trauma and lives her life in peace. She enjoys writing, researching Native American culture, and attending Powwows. When she's not attending Powwows, you will find Victoria spending time with her friends, her children and her grandchildren. www.VictoriaRamsey.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By all accounts, he\nwill easily win a foot race against the turtle. But the rabbit has a few\nproblems: He is arrogant, over confident, and lacks purpose and direction. In contrast, the tortoise is driven by a singular purpose\nand applies the maxim, \"Slow and steady wins the race,\" to defeat the Hare at\nhis own game. This fairy tale is irresistible, and simply begs for a\nmodern twist. In \"Run Turtle Run,\" the Hare is caught stealing carrots\nfrom a garden by the Tortoise. In the process of racing to town to defend his\ninnocence, the Hare finds himself entrapped in a foot race.

In this case,\nJamie has gone back to her career as a family law attorney after taking several\nmonths off following her mother's death. The story opens with Jamie losing an\nappeal in divorce court for her client, Becca Solomon, who is embroiled in a\nbitter divorce and custody battle with her husband, Joe. As they leave the\ncourtroom, Becca vows to kill Joe if he tries to take her daughters away from\nher. A few days later, Joe is dead of a drug and alcohol overdose. Naturally,\nsuspicion falls directly on Jamie's client, Becca.In this second novel in the Jamie Quinn Mystery series, Venkataraman has done\nit again! In \"The Case of the Killer Divorce\", she mixes the mystery\nof who killed Joe Solomon with some of Jamie's own story. Jamie's mother died\nwithout telling her who her father was and this mystery has haunted Jamie for\nyears. In this book, Venkataraman reveals who Jamie's father is and the\ncircumstances of her birth. Once again, we are treated to the great cast of\ncharacters we met in the first book of the series: best friend Grace,\nwomanizing private investigator Duke, and Aunt Peg who knows more than she is\ntelling. We are also introduced to a possible love interest. Venkataraman\nweaves all of these story lines together with intelligence and good humor. The\ndialogue between the characters is fun and smart while always advancing the\nplot. \"The Case of the Killer Divorce\" is a definite must-read.", "related": ["B00LNLVQ9Y"], "rank": 908708, "title": "The Case of the Killer Divorce: A Jamie Quinn Mystery", "author": "Barbara Venkataraman", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.5294, "rating_total": 77.0}

Soon after moving into their commune living facility, he began to hear voices and have hallucinations. Eventually, he found out that the church leader was a false prophet and Nick broke ties with the cult and made it back to his family. He was diagnosed schizophrenic and spent over 2+ years tormented by voices, hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and immense fears of hell and damnation. As a result of being brainwashed and spiritually abused by the cult members, he spent his early twenties suffering from the effects of major psychological trauma. It seemed to his family that most of his mind and personality were taken by the schizophrenia. It wasn't until his late 20's that Nick was supernaturally healed of the torment. He credits his complete healing to the revelation of Father God's loving heart, his faith in Jesus' finished work on the cross and being persistent in prayer. Since being set free from schizophrenia, Nick has ministered deliverance and healing to many people by the power of the Holy Spirit. His main passion in life is to continue to pursue a deep, intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit and to preach the Gospel in all the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How do you help a man you are starting to love, and pick the right woman for him when you're no longer in the running?Of course the idea of a reluctant bachelorette isn't a new one, but Clarissa Cartharn puts Zoe tentatively in the friendship zone, giving Scent of Roses just the thing to make it interesting. I love that everything from her looks to her intelligence is in marked contrast to Dante's usual conquests; and his attraction to her is causing him to rethink what he really wants. Because of the nature of reality show dating, there are plenty of interactions between them so you get to see the chemistry between them rather than just read about it. Zoe was a great character; both a little too romantic and a little too cynical all at once, which made her interesting and easy to empathize with. And Dante, well, Dante is handsome, ridiculously wealthy, and a pretty good guy so it is easy to see how it would be virtually impossible not to fall in love with him. Clarissa Cartharn did a fantastic job with this story. It is both engaging and endearing.", "related": ["B00ISJO1D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 52.0}

He initiated the construction of the Saudi Master Gas System, the consolidation of eastern Saudi Arabia's electric power grid and the Saudization of the company workforce while at all times representing the best interest of his American shareholders.  He worked closely with King Faisal during the Arab oil embargo and the oil price hikes of the 1970s. Since retirement in Oregon Jungers has been active with companies in the areas of hydrocarbons and energy, traveled to 200 countries with his wife Julie, an accomplished photographer; and revisited virtually all Arab Middle East countries, especially Saudi Arabia which he considers his second home. Jungers is active in philanthropy particularly with higher education, medical research and The Nature Conservancy. A former trustee of the American University of Cairo for 20 years, Jungers is especially involved with Oregon Health Sciences University, University of Washington, Central Oregon Community College and Bethlehem University in Palestine.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lawrence and Dylan Thomas buzzing around the small house. Chris studied Electronic Engineering in London, meeting and marrying Valerie in 1969. He worked for several years in Hampshire, then at the age of 31, the couple left to live in the Californian Silicon Valley, where Chris enjoyed a successful career as an Electronic Engineer. The author imprisoned in the engineer broke free upon his retirement in 2012, and Chris began his first full-length novel, ‘Aengus Amused’. Chris still lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, enjoying mountain biking, piloting small airplanes and most of all, writing. He and Val have two adult daughters.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When you examine that time, much of it is spent scrolling to places where you already advertise your book or looking for places to promote it. Books don't sell  themselves, so I'm willing to spend time to help readers find my cozy mysteries. But not too much time.I was a reluctant Twitter user and it took awhile to see what strategies paid off. I created a list of about one-hundred-fifty hashtags and I used them with brief promotional statements and a link to whatever book I was promoting. Eventually, I had a large group of ads so all I needed to do was add hashtags. Then I began to save each ad with hashtags already embedded in the text. I no longer needed to add a hashtag. All I do is copy a promotional piece from my Word document, paste to Twitter, and push Tweet.Since writers are compelled to pour out words, I posted a piece on my method to my blog (Irish Roots Author) and had a lot of positive feedback. This short book expands (a great deal) on that piece and adds a lot of specific hashtags. The list here goes way beyond mysteries.There is also a brief discussion of how to use Twitter and links to a couple of blog posts about tweeting.Twitter is free and I've refined my system (including the already-written Tweets) and spend about ten minutes per day using Twitter. This method can be used by anyone--though there is no guarantee there will be a big bump in sales. I do know that if I don't Tweet for a few days, my sales are lower. That's enough of a testament for me.Good luck with your sales, and feel free to suggest hashtags to add.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
