In a way, it’s not even a sports book, although it consists of essays, columns and features that Rushin, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, originally wrote for the magazine. Rushin’s real interest is the daring, dangerous and downright wacky things people do in the name of sport and competition. He gets a jolt out of finding thrill-seekers and joining them on their exploits, bringing his wry sense of humor along for the ride. What’s it like to play golf in the Arctic? The answer can be found in the title essay, which details Rushin’s own expedition in the \"Land of the Midnight Sun.\" How can a skinny guy eat 50.5 hotdogs in 12 minutes? Rushin talks to some of the world’s top competitive eaters. Why would someone ride a roller coaster for more than 1,000 hours? Rushin does his best to figure it out. Author of the widely acclaimed Road Swing: One Man’s Journey into the Soul of America’s Sports, Rushin has a gift for spotting absurdities and recording them in witty turns of phrase. Hockey players, he says, have \"crossword puzzle smiles,\" while a man who spends his days in a trailer, journeying from one stadium tailgate party to another, is \"the unholy offspring of Homer and Homer Simpson.\" His writing is so much fun that he can be forgiven for a few groaners, such as his reaction to the man who tells him that in Finland, golf is played in the snow with balls that are purple. Says Rushin: \"I imagine they must be.\" Competition of one kind or another is the backdrop to all of Rushin’s essays, but this book is not just fun and games. Also included is a heartfelt tribute to Rushin’s wife—the basketball superstar Rebecca Lobo—and an insightful look at the people and forces that have shaped modern-day pro sports. Whether you’re an avid sports fan or just looking for an entertaining read, this book will make you both laugh and think.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here are three useful and informative works for the loved ones and acquaintances of suicides and for those wanting to disabuse themselves of the many myths surrounding this once-taboo but now exigent subject. Lester (psychology, Richard Stockton State Coll.) has written a comprehensive summary of research findings for the general reader, complete with detailed bibliographic references. Its broad selection of 97 topics ranges from fundamental psychiatric issues to the influence of biorhythms on suicide. Wrobleski's book, in question-and-answer format like Lester's, is rather amorphous and the 85 answers somewhat cursory. Still, both the uninformed reader and those caregivers needing simplified advice for youth exhibiting suicidal behavior might welcome this style in contrast to Lester's more studious approach to many of the same questions. Neither Lester nor Wrobleski adequately discuss the most recent findings regarding biochemical indicators or the involvement of the neurotransmitter serotonin in suicidal behavior. Robinson's work is the most interesting of the three in that it personalizes many of the compelling and shadowy issues that remain after a suicide. The author, a journalist, discusses the warning signs of suicide, but her comments are principally addressed to those grieving in its aftermath. She succeeds in dispelling many of the misconceptions regarding the existence, causes, and outcome of suicide and in encouraging new coping mechanisms to turn grief into action. She also examines the religious and moral implications of suicide from several points of view.- William Abrams, Portland State Univ.

But there it stood, the protection he'd moments ago begged God to provide, an old farmhouse, once proud, now with bare windows and a door hanging by one hinge. Deserted by the owners, as were so many places in the drought-stricken plains. The crash of '29 had left hundreds floundering financially. And years of too little rain resulted in numerous farms abandoned to the elements. He didn't hold out much hope of 1934 being any different.Kody Douglas glanced upward. The black cloud towering high into the sky thundered toward him. An eerie yellow light filled the air. A noisy herald of birds flew ahead of the storm. Kody ducked his head against the stinging wind and nudged Sam into a trot. They'd better get inside before the dust storm engulfed them.In front of the house, he leaped from the saddle, led Sam across the worn threshold and dropped the reins to the floor. Sam would remain where he was parked until Kody said otherwise, but still he felt compelled to make it clear. \"You stay here, horse. And don't go leaving me any road apples. You can wait to do that business outside.\"He grabbed the rattling door and pushed it shut. A hook hung from the frame. The eye remained in the door, and he latched it.\"Probably won't hold once the wind hits,\" he told his ever patient mount and companion. Man got so he talked to the only living, breathing thing he shared his day with.Kody snorted. You'd think a man would get used to being alone. Seems he never could. Not that he cared a whole lot for the kind of company he encountered on the trail. Scoundrels and drifters willing to lift anything not tied down. Kody might be considered a drifter, but he'd never stoop to being a scoundrel. He had his standards.He yanked off his hat and slapped it against his thigh, creating his own private cloud of dust.He jammed the hat back on his head and glanced around. Place couldn't have stood empty for long. No banks of dirt in the corners or bird droppings on the floor. The windows were even still intact.The wind roared around the house. Sam tossed his head as the door banged in its crooked, uncertain state. Already the invading brown dust sifted across the linoleum. The air grew thick with it. The loose door wouldn't offer more than halfhearted protection, and Kody scanned the rest of the house, searching for something better.\"Don't go anywhere without me,\" he told Sam as he strode through the passageway into a second room. The drifting soil crunched under his boots.Again, God provided more than he asked and certainly more than he deserved. A solid door stood closed on the interior wall to his right. He could shelter there until the duster passed. He yanked open the door.\"Hold it right there, mister. I've got a gun and I'm not afraid to use it,\" a voice cracked.Kody's heart leaped to his throat and clutched at his tonsils. His nerves danced along his skin with sharp heels. Instinctively he raised his arms in the air, then slowly, cautiously, turned to locate the source of danger. He almost chuckled at the sight before him. A thin, brown-haired woman pressed into the corner, eyes steady, mouth set in a hard line. She held a rifle almost as long as she was tall.The upward flight of his arms slowed and began a gradual descent. \"You ain't gonna shoot me.\" It was about more'n she could do to keep the rifle level. The business end wobbled like one of those suffering trees in the wind outside.\"Back off or you'll see soon enough what I mean to do.\"He lowered his right arm a few more inches, at the same time taking one swift step forward.She gasped as he plucked the rifle from her.He cracked it open to eject the bullet. The chamber was empty. He roared with laughter. \"Lady, you got more guts than a cat stealing from a mother bear.\" Amusement made his words feel round and pleasant in his mouth. Unfamiliar, even. It'd been a long time since he'd done more than growl his words. He pulled his gaze from the woman who triggered the amusement, knowing his keen look made her uncomfortable.She jutted out her chin. \"This is my house. Get out.\"She lived here? In this deserted house? Alone?He stilled the questions pouring to his thoughts to deal with the immediate concern. \"I don't intend to go out in a blinding dust storm. And no God-fearing, decent woman would expect me to.\"She swallowed his accusation noisily. But nothing in her posture relented from her fierce protectiveness.\"I mean you no harm.\" Without seeking her permission, he sauntered to the corner farthest away, leaving her to plot her own actions. He made like he didn't care what she did, though his every nerve danced with alertness. Might be she had a hunk of wood hid beneath her skirts and would sneak up on him and smack him hard enough to give him a headache to regret. He didn't much figure she could overpower him even with a weighty length of two-by-four. He held back a heartfelt chuckle. Gotta admire a woman with so much spunk.He heard her slight hiss and from the corner of his eyes saw her take a faltering step toward the door, maybe more intent on escape than anything.The wind shook the house. The light faded. Through the window he watched the black cloud envelop them. Dust billowed through the cracks around the frame. They needed something to cover the window. In the dim light he made out a pile of material on the floor and, ignoring the woman's indrawn breath, went over to investigate. A ragged quilt. \"Why don't you have this over the window? It might keep out some of the dirt.\"\"What a wonderful idea. I should have thought of it myself.\" Her sarcasm nearly melted the paint off the wall.He snorted. \"That is a most uncharitable attitude.\"She put a rag to her nose. \"How do you suggest I get it to stay there? Or do you propose to hold it in place?\"\"Ma'am, where there's a will there's a way.\" What a sharp-tongued young woman. He held the quilt to the window. It greatly reduced the amount of dust coming through the cracks. A nail at one corner served as a hook. He felt around but could find no nail on the other corner. He pulled at the frame. It fit too tightly to allow him to stuff the material behind it. He stood with his arms over his head feeling as exposed as a deer in the middle of a bare field. And he was about to put himself into an even more vulnerable position. \"You happen to have a fork or knife handy I could jab in behind the frame and hold this in place?\"She crossed the room and handed him a nail. \"It fell out and I couldn't get it back in.\"The quilt darkened the room, but even in the dim light he immediately saw her problem. She barely came up to his armpit. She'd need something to stand on to reach the top of the window. She probably needed a stool to brush her teeth. He grinned at his silly imagination and plucked the nail from her fingers. But how to drive it in? \"Hold this.\"He scooted over to make room for her. She lifted her arms and pressed the quilt as high as her short stature allowed. He felt around the window until he found a crack between the frame and the wall and wedged the nail in as firmly as he could. He caught a corner of the quilt over it and stepped back. \"That should do.\"\"Thank you,\" she muttered as she headed back to the corner.He chuckled. She sounded about as grateful as if he'd handed her a bucket of sand. He returned to the opposite side of the room and hunkered down.\"Your house, hey?\"\"My brother's. I'm watching it for him.\"\"Don't look like it needs much watching.\" The room was about as bare as the mile after mile of windswept fields he'd ridden by. It didn't take a lot of looking to see the place was vacant. Except for this woman. \"What's anyone going to take?\"She made a sound that could have been anger or a signal of her intent to argue, but the storm increased in ferociousness. She ducked her head instead.He pressed his hankie to his nose and prepared to wait it out.* * *Charlotte huddled into the corner. He'd accused her of being uncharitable. Her own thoughts rebuked her for being sharp-tongued. Normally she was neither, but her patience had worn thin, and her fears fueled by unexpected, unfair circumstances. Her faith had been sorely tested of late. Tested but not abandoned. What else did she have left but her trust in God?Our Father, who art in heaven… She closed her eyes and silently repeated the words, mentally squeezing each for strength, determined to think of nothing but God's love and power.But a dust storm raged outside, sifting fine particles of dirt through the air, threatening to dry-drown her, and inside sat a strange man. Her nerves twitched with anxiety greater than she'd known even on her first night alone in the empty house.And not just any man. An Indian, complete with braids and a feather dangling from his cowboy hat.I will not fear. God is with me. He will never forsake me.The words had become her daily supplication since she'd walked into the house and found it empty—her brother, Harry, her sister-in-law, Nellie, and the two children had disappeared.She'd been at the Hendersons' with instructions from Nellie to help with the new baby. Upon her return she discovered them gone—lock, stock and kitchen supplies—and a note from Harry saying he couldn't take the drought any longer. They were going farther west. No room in the truck for her. He'd send for her soon, within a week for sure. He'd arrange for Mr. Henderson to deliver a message.They'd left barely enough food and water to last her.\"God will take care of me,\" she murmured.The frightening man turned. \"You say something?\"\"God will take care of me.\" She spoke louder, firmer. After all, He'd led the children of Israel through the desert. Her situation wasn't any worse. Except she was alone. No, not alone. God was with her. So she had reminded herself over and over.The house shook under the wind's attack. Dirt ground between her teeth. Her throat tickled. She breathed slowly to stop the urge to cough.

Just hours after Ellie finds her friend Penny Follette in a strangely animated mood, the usually mousy art historian is discovered dead in her bathtub with slit wrists. Police first assume suicide, but Ellie knows Penny wouldn't have killed herself—Penny was thrilled about her new pregnancy. When another friend of Ellie's is hospitalized by an apparent poisoning, Ellie's connection to the two victims makes her a suspect in the eyes of officials. Rosett complicates the story with the murder of another military wife and with a stalker who harasses Ellie. The author, also the wife of an air force pilot, includes practical tips for organizing closets, but the novel's most valuable insight is its window into women's lives on a military base.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As usual, Korsgaard's writing is engaging and pithy throughout, and it is hard not to be drawn inot the text.

Witnessing his awareness of Pax and his feelings develop is like watching a flower open. Slowly they nurture each other, and the love they find is sweet. It draws the reader in and keeps your interest throughout. I loved the descriptive details in this story.

Dogs and horses were brought from home, while chickens, rats, rabbits, lambs, and cows were found or stolen (and some became food for the starving armies). Horses and mules were obviously essential on the battlefield?General Lee's steed, Traveler, and General Meade's mount, Old Baldy, are given their due?and dogs and birds served as mascots or guards. The poignant story of Sallie, a mixed-breed dog, guardian of her fallen comrades at Gettysburg, is one of the almost 50 vignettes that Seguin (English, Kent State Univ.) has compiled, along with tales of favorite spotted cows and loyal lambs. Copiously illustrated with photographs and etchings and containing an extensive bibliography, this book provides a unique perspective on the Civil War for the general reader or animal enthusiast.

It was probably the most fun I've ever had writing, as it felt as if I was finding my voice. Having been a Christian since the age of 6, and so sure that I knew all about life because I was a good Bible student, I was shocked when my life came unglued in the early 1980's. What I discovered was that from my family, church, culture, and my own experiences, I had gathered up so many distortions about who I was and who God is and how life works, that I no longer knew which way was up. Turns out that the theology we learn in Sunday School is no match for the lies we learn from our own life experience. What's more, we encounter truth all the time without being changed by it at all.This book is about the process of unmasking and disarming those lies so we can be set free. Getting this truth down on paper was a joy. And my life is wonderfully different today as a result of the paradigm shifts embedded in these pages.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His background research of Ojibwa history and that of the early European settlers that trapped the waterways delineating the Canadian border was instrumental in producing an accurate book.

In fact, feminism and motherhood have been often thought of as incompatible.Profound, provocative, and innovative,Feminist Art and the Maternalis the first work to critically examine the dilemmas and promises of representing feminist motherhood in contemporary art and visual culture. Andrea Liss skillfully incorporates theory with passionate personal reflections on the maternal, and in doing so she advances a fresh and necessary perspective on both feminism and art.Offering new research on works by well-known and emerging artists who approach feminist motherhood issues from their own knowledge and experiences, Liss explores a wide range of examples from the challenging to the taboo, including Mary Kelly’sPost-Partum Document, Mierle Laderman Ukeles’s Maintenance Art projects, Renée Cox’s Yo’ Mama portraits, and Ngozi Onwurah’s filmThe Body Beautiful.Liss considers traditional characteristics that mothers are assumed to possess, such as nurturing, empathy, and sacrifice for their children—qualities that paradoxically have negatively defined women as “sentimental”—and assertively revalues them within both motherhood and feminism. Throughout, she deftly intertwines theoretical analysis with the arresting and enlightening first-person voices of artist-mothers and their children.Putting forth an original ethics of feminism and the maternal—how to be in the place of the otherandinside one’s self, how to care for anotherandone’s self—Liss reconceives the mother-child relationship as a model for relations among races, genders, and ages and radically reinterprets maternal traits as vital forms of social, artistic, and political address.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Davis Bunnwas recognized internationally as a consultant, lecturer, and speaker in the area of international finance and received invitations to address symposiums, conferences, and management meetings. His professional interests took a decided turn nearly eighteen years ago. Although he continued his career in international finance, he became a \"closet\" novelist. For nine years, he wrote with discipline and drive, never to have anything published. When one of his novels came to the attention of Bethany House Publishers, his status as an unpublished novelist changed. His first book,The Presence,was published in 1990 and quickly became a bestseller.A prolific writer, he now has over twenty books in publication, including three with Janette Oke, a wonderful children's picture book calledPrincess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat, the heartwarming gift bookThe Quilt,and his latest,The Dream Voyagers,originally published under the pen name Thomas Locke.\"The novels I've had published by Bethany House are the direction I hope my future writing will take--captivating stories of intrigue, drama and faith, with compelling characters in an enjoyable contemporary fictional setting,\" says Bunn. \"The emotional bonding that occurs with the reader in good fiction often gives the Christian message more direct meaning in the reader's life.\"Prior to his work in international finance, Davis completed studies in psychology and economics at Wake Forest University. Fluent in three languages, he has traveled extensively in more than forty countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Davis has also avocationally become a serious student of comparative religion, learning from Jewish rabbis, Buddhist monks, Muslim imams, Catholic priests, and Baptist ministers. Drawing on these experiences, Davis fills his books with colorful dialogue and richly textured settings.size : 4.4 x 6.6", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jessica's body is found in the church on Easter morning, posed near the altar with her clothes pulled apart; five keys on the organ are forced down with wedges of paper in a pattern of notes that must be a clue. There is a teenaged boy whom everyone assumes to be gay, a pastor whose sexual orientation is less obvious, a couple who had lived with the dead woman and have clearly fallen from grace and various other dark souls, virtually all of whom bore a grudge against Jessica and possess a modicum of musical theory. Wycliffe insinuates himself into this small town, carefully probing at raw emotional nerves until he finds the killer.

Sometimes an unpleasant character can look more pleasant in an extreme situation.  We might not like living near violent, aggressive people, yet we are grateful that they are out there defending our country.I wanted to show three things:1   That many problems between people are created by our own take on the intentions of an individual.2  That people whose characters are at odds with everyday life can often shine when the situation changes,  i.e. good or bad can be relative to a  situation.3  When the mind can't cope with a situation, it has the capability to delete the offending part and invent a whole new reality.People  who want to read a story about good little children should avoid this book.  My characters  did not have a good upbringing, are not the most balanced individuals but they know how to survive!", "related": ["B00K5C1G6U"], "rank": 3937343, "title": "The Redemption", "author": "Des Birch", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He stayed there for more years than most would ever admit to, quitting the life only when his student allowances ran out.

He spends his nights talking to his cats! He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years, and has finally got used to the smell of sulfur! When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, he drinks strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consumes copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally). He lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats, worshipping them with regular gifts of food, occasional grooming and by providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and finally concluded that God is a cat!

Carole, his wife of forty-five years says, 'that should make him a mature writer' Educated at private schools he was editor of his school magazine. Unable to secure a University scholarship he joined Westminster Bank, and then became an hotelier. John joined the Pest Control industry based in the UK before migrating with his family in 1971 as 'ten pound Poms' They became naturalised in 1973. After retirement in 2003 he started to 'smell the flowers' and realised how most of them smelled the same. Unable to play golf, he discovered a passion for writing. Reluctant Hero is a true story about John's dad, Bill, who was a Lancaster bomber pilot in the Second World War. Traditional publishers in Australia and the UK turned the book down for numerous reasons; Principally, John being an unknown author, his dad Bill not being famous, and an holistic approach to whether the book would be profitable and sell in sufficient numbers to justify their investment. Added to that was an underlying reluctance to publish a controversial book. One that posed an alternative view to those held in high esteem such as the powers-that-be, known in the UK, as the Establishment. Another work in progress is; Sex, Knives & Crazy People, a light-hearted read about John's life in the Harewood Hotel, Royal Tunbridge Wells, England where he worked as an hotelier and met his wife Carole in 1965. It is another true story. Other books might follow about their migration, difficulties faced by Poms in Oz during the 1970s and John's lifetime at work in the Pest Industry. Nil bastardi carberandum!

He was the most fashionable artist of his day, painting many leading society figures - including his artistic muse, Emma Hamilton, mistress of Lord Nelson. Romney was born in Beckside in Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire (now part of Cumbria), the 3rd son (of 11 children) of John Romney, cabinet maker, and Anne Simpson. He was sent to school at Dendron, but appears to have been an indifferent student and was withdrawn at the age of 11 and apprenticed to his father's business instead. He proved to have a natural ability for drawing and making things from wood - including violins (which he played throughout his life). From the age of 15, he was taught art informally by a local watchmaker called John Williamson, but his studies began in earnest in 1755, when he went to Kendal, at the age of 21, for a 4-year apprenticeship with local artist Christopher Steele - a portraitist who had himself studied with distinguished French artist Carlo Vanloo. All costs were to be born by George's father. In October 1756, Romney married Mary Abbot (a decision he initially regretted), but the couple were immediately separated when he was called away to York on business by his employer. After a year, Steele eventually agreed to cancel the apprenticeship, at George's request, leaving the young artist - now a father of a son - free to pursue his own career as a painter.", "related": ["B005LEY5Q0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though Turkish-Serbian hostilities wax and wane, typhus hits, and Leo is determined to stay and help. That's not the only unexpected development. Wearing breeches and with her hair cropped, Leo is mistaken for a young man by the dashing Serb Colonel Malkovic, who makes use of her translation and personal-assistant skills. In a Shakespearian turn, Leo is smitten and afraid that he will disdain her for her deceit in a time and place when only scandalous women ride horses astride. Green's smooth, measured pace perfectly fits the era immediately preceding WWI. This is the first in the Leonora trilogy, and the promise of more of her adventures will delight readers. -- Booklist, August 1, 2011", "related": ["B00BKQ0PMQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He rose from a humble background to complete his geshe studies at Sera Je Monastic University in Lhasa with highest honors and was privileged to serve as a debate opponent for the Dalai Lama's own geshe examination in 1959. He moved to New Jersey in the United States in 1963 and in 1967 began teaching in the Buddhist Studies Program at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is now professor emeritus. In 1975, he founded the Deer Park Buddhist Center in Oregon, Wisconsin, site of the Dalai Lama's first Kalachakra initiation granted in the West. He is the author of several books in English, including the five-volume comprehensive teaching,Steps on the Path to Englightenment.David Patt received his PhD in Buddhist Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is the author ofA Strange Liberation: Tibetan Lives in Chinese Hands. He recently served as executive director of the Dzogchen Foundation.Beth Newman received her PhD in South Asian Languages and Literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She teaches at Ringling School of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida, and is the translator ofThe Tale of the Incomparable Prince.Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language, his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world. His efforts to foster dialogue among leaders of the world's faiths envision a future where people of different beliefs can share the planet in harmony. Wisdom Publications is proud to be the premier publisher of the Dalai Lama's more serious and in-depth works.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was also a contributing editor for one of them for more than ten years. Topics ran the gamut from professional sports, medicine, archeology, and photography to science.After twenty years away from Arizona he returned in 1985 and it has been the base from which all his photographic excursions are launched. Along with many others he has embraced digital photography but can still be seen, from time to time, peering through the ground glass of a large format camera or hoisting a large medium format 6x7.", "related": ["B004TP8OSM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Petracca, was born in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York in 1967. At the age of 6, he was found to have a loss of hearing that was corrected, but then developed into a stuttering problem. Doctors also found him to be dyslexic. This made learning to read and write a real challenge. After years of therapy and rehab, he was able to overcome the stuttering problem. His love of reading developed after he received a copy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. When he was 24, he joined the U.S. Coast Guard. While on watch as an engineer, his downtime was spent reading. Once he was out of the Coast Guard, he took up Emergency Medicine, his 2nd love. After finishing a Paramedic program at Stony Brook University, he found more time to read.  His sister gave him the idea of keeping an “Idea Book”, a place to jot down things that pop in your head. That spurred his writing career and his first novel, The Immortal Game: Rise of the Water Bearer.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He made several trips to Europe, Asia and the Americas visiting sites of ancient civilizations. He has walked in historic Russian palaces, castles of England and Germany, the Imperial City and The Great Wall of China. The author lived for over a year in Central America where he spent time visiting Mayan sites in Honduras and Guatemala. He also visited many Toltec and Aztec sites in Mexico. While living in Colorado, he and his wife spent considerable time exploring ancient ruins in southwest. When he visited National Parks in 1985, he became fascinated with the ancient Anasazi who built a society in the United States equal to the Mayans and Aztecs. While sitting in the Great Kiva in Chaco Canyon National Park he had a revelation that inspired some twenty years of research on the Anasazi. In numerous trips to the area, he has visited most of their significant ancient ruins. The author read numerous books about the archeological, architectural, and sociological research on this ancient culture. He researched the Hopi and Zuni cultures, for information on the religious practices and beliefs passed down for generations through the chant ways. He used The Old and New Testaments of the Bible, The Book of Mormon, the Torah and the Quran to gather religious information. He researched Hebrew names, Book of Mormon names, as well as Aztec names for use in his books . . .", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was born into a family of writers and always wrote my own stories for fun. I can't remember a time in my life when I didn't write. Writing has always been my world. According to my friends and family, I have a bizarre sense of humor that finds its way into all of my novels. I strongly believe that laughter is an important part of life and I usually say that laughter makes the unthinkable bearable. When I wrote At Least You're Not Bert, I thought about misery and the way that people cope with terrible or disturbing situations that are beyond their control. In my experience, people handle life's sucker punches through laughter. It's especially fun to laugh at someone who is worse off than you are. They say that misery loves company and Bert makes any miserable person feel better about themselves, because he's worse off than everyone. So, Bert brings a dose of laughter and I think laughter makes life's difficulties more bearable. I spend the majority of my time writing when I'm not on work related travel. I'm passionate about animal rescue and support many causes. I hope you enjoy At Least You're Not Bert.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Plato was also a mathematician, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the western world. Plato is widely believed to have been a student of Socrates, and to have been as much influenced by his thinking as by what he saw as his teacher's unjust death.Plato's brilliance as a writer and thinker can be witnessed by reading his Socratic dialogues. Some of the dialogues, letters, and other works that are ascribed to him are considered spurious. Interestingly, although there is little question that Plato lectured at the Academy that he founded, the pedagogical function of his dialogues, if any, is not known with certainty. The dialogues have since Plato's time been used to teach a range of subjects, mostly including philosophy, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, and other subjects about which he wrote.\"(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He's taught novel writing for several community colleges, worked over twenty years for the BNSF Railway, and is a former US Marine Recon Scout, Super Squad team leader, parachutist and troop handler. He enjoys SCUBA, sailing, snow skiing and sharing time with his kids and grandkids. His thriller novels Jezebel, Dead Reckoning, and Brainstorm are all in both paper and eBook. His latest men's action/adventure thrillers, Knight's Ransom and Knight's Late Train, were released in 2012. Four or five more in \"The E Z Knight Reports\" series are scheduled for release in the coming months. These novels are about half the size of his big thrillers and are fast, fun reads. Gordon's also published two short story eBooks: a humorous piece called \"Toothpick for Two\" and a nostalgic romance called \"Jack Baron\". Please check them out. Along with his fiction, he's published a book for writers, Novel Writing Made Simple; a great primer for beginners and an excellent refresher for the experienced wordsmith. He's a founder and currently president of the Kansas Writers Association, a sixteen-year-old organization of some very special people. Last year, he started a group to help support independent authors called the Indie Writers Alliance--another group of great people. A second book on writing, EBook Writing Made Simple, focuses on the actual writing of eBook novels and how they can be crafted more effectively for the eBook novel reader rather than as a work written for the traditional publishing industry.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.7143, "rating_total": 26.0}

Many within the group thought I would be the heir apparent, but in 1979 I left the group, disillusioned by the psychic tethers my teacher kept on his flock.After wandering for a while in the wilderness of doubt and skepticism, a friend called and asked me to join a consulting firm that combined personal growth and leadership training. Over the next few years I learned to coach and train executives in communication, conflict resolution, and vision management.Eventually I left the firm and started my own company and developed programs for adults (On Course), corporations (Communication For Results), and teens (Step Into the Future) that combined spiritual principles and commitment-based practices that produced real world results for thousands of people in the US and Canada.I retired in 1995, and moved with my wife to a small farm in Northern California. One day the phone rang and it was an old friend who had taken our courses, and whose company we had worked with before he sold it. He asked us to join him in making the next big idea come to life. The idea was candles and everything related to living by candlelight. We called it Illuminations, and it grew into 80 stores, and eventually was sold to Yankee Candle.At Illuminations I designed and wrote copy for some of our most successful products, including a line of Intention candles that Oprah featured on her TV show as one of her favorite gifts. I also wrote a book and candle set called Rituals: Light for the Soul, which was published by Chronicle Books in San Francisco and sold a respectable 30,000 copies.I am now in my third retirement, although it doesn't feel that way at all.My motto is this: Awareness itself is the teacher.I live today in the mountains above Santa Barbara, California with my wife Paulette.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was either books or boredom.  Books won hands down.  From mysteries to suspense and finally on to romance in her early teens up to the present, reading has been her favorite form of recreation. Always partial to happy endings and forever after type stories, Brigette became an avid reader of romance novels and began dreaming of a day when she would write a novel of her own—although back then she didn’t particularly like writing. As destiny would have it, on the threshold of twenty this romantic at heart got a chance to live out her own true life love story when she met the man of her dreams.  After a romance to remember, she experienced her own happy ending and is now living her ‘'forever after’' with her husband, Clifford, and her four children, Miranda, Clifford, Jr., Melissa, and Christian.  While pursuing a degree in Professional and Technical Communication in the early 90's, she developed and honed her writing skills and began to discover that writing wasn’t quite the chore it had been in high school; and she truly liked it.  Pen hit paper after her first daughter was born, and she hasn’t stopped writing since.  From Passion to Pleasure is her second published work. Brigette has found increasing joy in the precious moments she has claimed in her life to write her romance novels.  Shy at heart, for years she has been a closet writer of fictional love stories, sharing only with her husband and children.  Over the past year she has been sharing her stories incrementally with others and has received exciting responses to the tales she tells.  She hopes that you will enjoy From Passion to Pleasure.", "related": ["B00GW9GWIW"], "rank": 589942, "title": "From Passion to Pleasure (Five Brothers Book 1)", "author": "Brigette Manie", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From a very young age, I showed an aptitude for telling stories. Of course my mother called me a pathological liar, but I prefer to think back on those days as an apprenticeship for my future craft. After the birth of my daughter, my husband suggested I take up writing as a hobby to fill my days. The hobby became a love, and the love an obsession. (Sometimes my husband is sorry he ever made that suggestion.)  I learned how to write from the best--the authors who penned the books I spent countless hours reading.

This is a hilarious, sometimes\nprofane, frequently deeply moving tale of how they deal with the curve\nball that life has thrown them. He faces the challenge of his own ageing\n process, works out his philosophy on life and recognizes that he still\ncraves a creative outlet, and decides to become an author! Quite a\npersonal journey.Part Two is his first novel - \"The Twilight Escort Agency\", an exposé of\n retirees and life in the not-so-fast lane, on Queensland's Gold Coast.\nThe story revolves around an Escort Agency for the more 'mature' client\nlooking for fun times and companionship, and the equally \"mature\"\nescorts! This is a very funny book full of saucy and at times bawdy\nhumour proving getting old doesn't mean being over it all!Given his resilience, humour\n and attitude, and the quality of his other novels, I think his future\nlooks very bright.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Susan Gluck Mezey provides a comprehensive and richly detailed reference that is indispensable to understanding the interplay in American policymaking among judges, other legal and political elites, and public opinion. A truly enlightening book. (Daniel R. Pinello, author of Gay Rights and American Law and America?s Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage)I learned a lot from readingQueers in Court, and expect to consult it many times. The book is must reading for students of gay and lesbian politics, but it will also be useful for anyone interested in social movements in the American courts. It provides that rare balance of a broad perspective that still includes all of the details specialists require. (Clyde Wilcox, Professor of Government, Georgetown University)Queers in Courtprovides a nuanced historical survey that builds on the already-rich scholarly analysis of U.S. judicial rulings on sexual diversity. Susan Gluck Mezey’s background in the exploration of rights litigation by other traditionally-marginalized groups allows her to draw parallels to other struggles without ignoring the distinctive features of queer claims. She also punctures some of the myths about American judicial “activism”—pointing to the recurrent restraint of federal courts and of most state courts. This is a healthy response to both overly-optimistic litigants and highly-selective critics who don't want to believe that there are any LGBT claims that have popular support. (David Rayside, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto)I view the book as a welcome addition to a library supporting gay rights research and believe it would be useful to a broader audience of other scholars, activists, and advocates. (Sharon WhitneyLaw and Politics Book Review)A valuable resource for attorneys and scholars. (Booklist, September 28, 2009)Queers in Courtis an excellent overview of gay rights litigation in the U.S. It is thorough yet readable. It covers topics ranging from marriage to the military, it covers them over half a century of American history, it appreciates their nuances, and it places litigation in the context of public opinion.Queers in Courtwould be useful in a college or law school classroom and it would also be good company on a long plane flight. In one volume, it provides a solid, well-rounded, easily-digested introduction to all of gay law. (William Rubenstein, UCLA School of Law; Founding Director, Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law; and Former Director, ACLU Lesbian & Gay Rights Project)Overall, the book makes a tremendous contribution to the study of judicial policymaking and to the study of sexuality and politics by chronicling, in great detail, the litigation surrounding important elements of LGBT family life....Mezey has created a tremendous resource of students and cholars of the courts and the study of sexuality. The author has taken great care in analyzing the reasoning of important cases....Overall, this book, particularly combined with Mezey*s QUEERS IN COURT, is an excellent addition to the growing scholarship on law, politics, and policies relating to sexual minorities and presents more evidence why this topic is particularly important for scholars of the judiciary.

I really appreciate you stopping by and taking a look. I guess in some ways I am an alternative medicine renegade. I talk about topics that, in my opinion, are critical for human health (mental, physical and spiritual). However, many people don't want to hear it because it places the responsibility for their weight and health squarely on their shoulders. I believe there is a health crisis in our country. We've all heard of the obesity epidemic and how children of grade-school age are being diagnosed with adult diseases as hypertension and Type II Diabetes. And, if the children are ill and overweight, then that means the parents are probably just as bad or worse. Indeed, there is a health crisis. But more than that, there is a crisis of personal responsibility. Giving in and 'going with the flow' is easy, at least for now. But sooner or later the piper comes around to collect with some sort of sickness, an unexpected condition that suddenly sobers the mood. And the truth can no longer be denied or escaped. That is why I have written this series of books. I want to use them to carry the message that EVERY weight loss goal CAN be reached with the proper mental artillery and physical preparation. I know what it's like to suffer with obesity and an eating disorder. Food addiction took more than 20 years of my life, and I want to prevent that from happening to anyone else. So here I am for all who care to listen.

Gousseva does an excellent job at showing the unique moment in time in modern Russian history for us foreigners from the West, so we can understand better how it impacted personally and in a wider cultural context.Giving us some historical and political background and fleshing it out with youthful romance Moscow Dream is exactly the kind of novel I love.Written in excellent prose, perfect pacing and just the right amount of emotions this is a touching, informative and wonderful reading experience that I cannot recommend enough.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 36, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 174.0}

Out of the blue, Jonathan, a 30-something London lawyer, bluntly informs Nicola, his live-in girlfriend of six years, that they should split up because he feels the relationship \"just isn't working.\" The impact of this decision stuns Nicola, who dutifully moves out of their apartment and tries to understand where things went wrong. Creating a brilliant primer on the battle of the sexes, the author brings together the observations of Nicola's married friends, Susannah and Geoffrey; Jonathan's married friends, Lizzie and Alfred; and the parting couple's respective parents. Although it is occasionally difficult to immediately discern who is speaking, the multiple viewpoints work well to enliven the pace and present a multifaceted glimpse into Nicola's predicament and Jonathan's unexpected reactions to the domestic tragedy he set in motion. Watching Nicola grieve for her lost love, readers experience everything from her bewildered sense of denial that she and Jonathan are actually breaking up to her final acceptance of her changed circumstances, and the bittersweet conclusions she comes to as she seeks other possibilities for romance and excitement. Using spare prose, sparkling dialogue and painfully true observations on family life, St. John creates a winning combination of humor and pathos.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight\nfrom school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea\nfor three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined\n the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids\nand now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy\nin 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I\nstarted and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to\nAntigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we\nmanage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in\nParadise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I\nwas 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by\nthen so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole\nfamily fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The tips and strategies\nI've learned from the Blue Bank guides at Reelfoot have been useful when I've\nfished and hunted other bodies of water all across the nation. So, I know these\ntactics are universally applicable. The second reason is whenever I want to\nhave a good time, laugh, catch fish and take ducks, I go to Reelfoot. I go not\nonly to learn, to write and to photograph, but to be with some of the\nmost-enjoyable people I know and eat absolutely-delicious food. A fishing or\nhunting trip to Reelfoot is the trip of a lifetime, every time you go. The\nguides there treat you like you're their favorite cousin who's come for a short\nvisit.Question: When's the\nbest time to go to Reelfoot Lake?Phillips: I'll have to say duck season, because you can hunt\nducks in the mornings and then fish in the afternoons. Or, I'll have to name\nspring, because you can catch a limit of bass, a limit of crappie, bluegills at\ntimes and 50 to 100 pounds of catfish all in one day. Or, I may have to say the\nsummer months, because I love to see young people laugh when fat bluegills make\ntheir poles kiss the water, or they experience the mystery of fishing for\ncatfish at night with Yo-Yos. I have to admit, I love catching those bluegills\nand catfish in the summer, just like the kids. So, to be honest, any time you\nwant to have a great trip outdoors, you can't beat Reelfoot Lake. Question: If I live\nin a different part of the country, can I use the tactics outlined in this\nbook?Phillips: Absolutely. I know, because I've done it. I've\ntaken the lessons I've learned at Reelfoot and applied them to fishing and\nhunting all over the nation. Often one tip from Reelfoot dramatically can\nchange the outcome of a hunting or fishing trip in another place. I pull deeply\nfrom the well of knowledge I've developed at Reelfoot every time I venture into\nthe outdoors.", "related": ["B006WO3F0U"], "rank": 1505226, "title": "Reelfoot Lake", "author": "John E.

In 1927 he retired from the world of finance and, with the proceeds, left for Paris to write serious fiction. Before turning to detective fiction, he wrote three novels that received favorable reviews, but it was writing detective fiction, and as creator of the Nero Wolfe character, that he become famous as a writer. The first Nero Wolfe novel,Fer-de-Lance, appeared In 1934. It was followed by many others, which established Nero Wolfe on a par with Erle Stanley Gardner’s famous Perry Mason.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is known for his powerful and direct style, and his ability to make the works accessible to the modern reader while remaining faithful to the original work. This unique talent is making his work increasingly the translations of choice for high schools, colleges and universities throughout the English-speaking world. While many have translated ancient Greek classic works into English, and many others have given us new and inspiring translations of Kafka, Nietzsche, Rousseau, Aristotle, Rene Descartes, Denis Diderot and Karl Marx, how many can be said to have successfully translated all of those mentioned, and more? It requires a unique and special talent to translate the work of so many in such a variety of languages and genres, and all with so intimate a translation that there have been greater than 18 million page viewings to the various works on this translator's website since it's inception.

Very similar to \"The Hardy Boys\" and \"Nancy Drew\" mysteries familiar to those of us considered \"boomers\", Pepper Jones is a 14 year old High School student who has been successful - and lucky - at solving a number of mysteries around her home town. She has the very helpful assistance of a Civil War era ghost by the name of Jacob Longstreet, who happens to be invisible to everybody except Pepper; that fact gives her a decided advantage at times while working on a case.There are 11 stories in this very reasonably priced collection, and each of them is an extraordinarily good young adult/pre-teen mystery story. Whether solving just-committed robberies or cracking 40 year old coded messages, when Pepper and Longstreet are on the job, the bad guys don't stand a chance. These stories aren't just reminiscent of \"The Hardy Boys\" and \"Nancy Drew\"; they are every bit as well written, engaging, and fun to read. J T Lewis writes youth mysteries on par with those two legendary series. Although it is classified as \"Young Adult\" fiction, I can personally testify that old adults too will enjoy these stories. The author has found his niche, and has the talent to excel in this genre. His characters are as real as your next door neighbor, with a touch of the paranormal thrown in just for fun.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Richman is an adventure story of two brothers who set out to find their parents who have been kidnapped. Christopher and Michael unite together in this quest. They embark on this mission and end up finding out that they have to fight for their own lives to survive. The story is a mix of adventure and mystery which makes it an exciting read.I liked the portrayal of both the characters, Christopher and Michael. They are the characters who give pace and action to the story with their quest. The adventure slowly turns into a mystery once they are over the Pacific Coast mountains after crossing the ocean. The author has developed the plot well and slowly moved from an adventure to a mystery. It is a good story for children and the descriptions make the story visual. The writing style is simple and entertaining. The story moves quickly, keeping readers engaged.The author has linked the sub-plots along with the main plot very well, making the story flow. The characters are smart and they will impress readers with how they overcome obstacles with a lot of skill. The theme will interest children and all the adventure and mystery will give them a lot of excitement while reading. The other characters also lend good support to Christopher and Michael and make the plot interesting. An enjoyable story and very effortless story telling that makes it an engaging read.\"", "related": ["B00JVSXCV6"], "rank": 2705901, "title": "Brothers, Bullies and Bad Guys: First in the Boulton Quest Series", "author": "ND Richman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 34.0}

He wants to add conscience to Freud's typology of id, ego and superego, none of which can be thought of as reified bounded entities but as dynamic dimensions of a single complex self. He sees conscience as the realm of morality, especially the requirement to love one another, something Freud himself seemed to recognize with his late conception of eros in the dichotomy between eros and thanatos. Carveth's book is not only relevant to the psychoanalytic community, which surely needs it, but to the wider public in providing a deeper context for the great insights of Freud and his followers.\"\"What will be our moral purpose? And, how may we exceed the confines of rationality in learning to live with others? With these questions Donald Carveth’s superb study integrates social theory with the history of psychoanalytic thought. With deep sensitivity to the nuances of mental life and the dilemmas theory inherits, the study proposes the psychoanalytic project as one of listening to the voice of conscience. Carveth provides insightful readings of the moral significance of guilt from a number of perspectives and argues for a shift from the superego to that of conscience. Questions of theology are placed between the cultural and clinical realms and readers encounter the modern dilemmas of tolerating mental pain as the human condition.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whether telling you how to pay taxes, change a flat tire, navigate a relationship with a house-mate, or stop beating yourself up with the club of perfectionism, Nields is amusing, smart, lively, and full of surprises.

In succinct prose he boldly critiques insidious expressions of white supremacy and deftly identifies the persistent hazards of black complicity. Ikard deploys Black feminist theory to analyze a range of texts from Edward P. Jones’s critically acclaimed novel, The Known World to Lee Daniels’s controversial film, Precious. His sobering examination of Trayvon Martin’s brutal murder and his unflinchingly candid personal narratives underscores the importance of black male feminist theorizing. Ikard’s dazzling close readings disrupt conventional ideas about these landmark texts and cultural moments in ways that invigorate African American literary and cultural studies.\" —Lisa B. Thompson, author of Beyond the Black Lady: Sexuality and the New African American Middle Class\"David Ikard is among our sharpest and most exciting thinkers on race, culture and politics and this collection features some of his most incisive work. Adroit in its analysis, elegant in its prose, consider Blinded by the Whites required reading.\" —William Jelani Cobb, author of The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama & the Paradox of Progress\"What immediately strikes you about Blinded by the Whites is the sheer range of texts that David Ikard engages, including himself—this is the work of a mature, theoretically sophisticated, interdisciplinary scholar. Yet Ikard manages to always 'make it plain,' to shout out the neighborhood preacher, as if he was literally breaking it down for the son and daughter that serve as the inspirations for this important intervention.\" —Mark Anthony Neal, author of Looking for Leroy: Illegible Black Masculinities", "related": [], "rank": 1963449, "title": "Blinded", "author": "David H.

I was born into a military family, and my mother continued the tradition of moving us every few years even after my parents divorced. Consequently, when asked \"Where are you from?\" I either dodge the question or stutter and stumble through a litany of various towns in Colorado and California. I do feel very much at home in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and I have lived longer in New York City than anywhere else. I suppose in another ten years, I'll be comfortable calling the Big Apple my hometown. As for books, I am partial to fantasy but love well-written novels of all genres. I have been writing fiction since high school, but until recently I let life get in the way of developing something publishable.

I was born in Michigan in 1972 and grew up in Mount Pleasant. It's called the \"Mountain Town\" but there is no mountain and it's debatable about whether it's pleasant. They say it's a party town and based on extensive research as a young adult I can concur. Because I always had the childhood fantasy of running away and joining the circus, I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1995 and lived there until 1997. Those who only stay a week are wimps, but I will say that it's the second year in Vegas that wears you down. Then I realized the pioneers were trying to get to California, so I moved to Chico, in Northern California and lived there until 2009.  In 2000, I earned a journalism degree from California State University, Chico with the conscious ambition of becoming a fiction writer. With the rapid demise of the newspaper industry and journalism in general, novelist is not such a daft pursuit after all. It's not like I'm actually going to get a job that values my education. Luckily I'm cursed with the impulse to write in a popular yet competitive genre. My wandering has circled back and I'm currently residing in Battle Creek, Michigan, and for now my existence within the post-apocalyptic Rust Belt is suitably fascinating.", "related": [], "rank": 28770, "title": "Werelord Thal", "author": "Tracy Falbe", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am a descendant of immigrants in the 1920's from Cebu in the Central Visayas, who acquired tracts of land as \"homesteads\" in Lanao del Sur, a province with a large Muslim population.   Walk with me in  my journey as the woven tapestry of events unravel through education at Silliman University in the Philippines and Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington;  marriage to Dr, Merton D. Munn, Presbyterian missionary to Silliman University;  service at Silliman, with the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia in New York, at Lakeland Village School in Medical Lake, Washington, Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska, and as Principal of Blair Elementary School on Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington.   I survived the turmoil and challenges after my husband's death.  Meandering through widowhood in search for a life with purpose, I decided to help build and develop Shalom Science Institute, a non-profit Christian school in Balabagan.  It was a turning point in my retirement, one that had taken me to China to teach for four years and to Chile for two years to generate funds to build the school.   From experience with leeches in the jungle in the Philippines, to view the vast expanse of China from the Great Wall and to climb the Moia Statue quarry in Easter Island in 2007 is a span of sixty six years! I continue on bridging the gap between Christians and Filipino Muslims in Balabagan, my hometown… My story is far from over!", "related": [], "rank": 3105974, "title": "Bridging the Gap eBook", "author": "Eufemia Munn", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the heroic efforts to survive the life chronicled in his boyhood story, he went on to college, worked for Penn Mutual Life and Remington Arms, served in the Navy in WWII, finished his education, and earned a Masters at what is now Northern Colorado University and then a degree in Sacred Theology from Seabury Western Seminary in Evanston, Illinois.  He served in various capacities in Episcopal parishes in Ft. Lupton, Loveland, Greeley, Salida, Westcliffe, and Buena Vista, Colorado, and McCook, Lincoln, Grand Island, and Hastings Nebraska, where he ended his active ministry as Dean of the Pro-Cathedral. Over those years he belonged to the Civil Air Patrol and Rotary International, headed several PTAs, served on he board of Clarkson Hospital (Omaha), and was in much demand as a speaker.  The statue of the lion in the courtyard of St. Mark's, Lincoln, is a memorial to him, where he is fondly remembered as \"The Lion of St. Marks\"!  He remained active, even in retirement. During a critical period in the history of the Diocese of Nebraska, he came out of retirement to serve as its Pastor at Large.  Despite his later years being plagued by the consequences of childhood injuries incurred during the course of the story he tells in Loneliness Is a Train Whistle, he managed to devote a great deal of time to giving talks in rehabilitation facilities and counseling and hearing \"Fifth Steps\" from people in recovery. He participated in the beginning of the Hospice program in Grand Island, Nebraska, while he served on the board of St. Francis Hospital. He was honored in his lifetime as an award-winning insurance salesman, an inventor of improvements in radar technology, and an invited participant in the College of Preachers.  He counted among the highlights of his life praying at President Eisenhower's visit to McCook, his close friendship with many Governors and Senators from Nebraska and Colorado, and having played in a band under the direction of John Philip Sousa.  Among his joys were winning a duffer's class trophy in golf, speaking and guiding community groups, and being present when the National Cathedral dedicated the completion of its final tower. But his greatest joys were his 66 years of marriage to Dorothy Lucille Urie, becoming father to their son Charles, and taking part in reunions with his family and in-laws.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The middle of three children, she entered the world via her parents' house.  Her mother walked into the hospital carrying the infant 45 minutes after Darragh was born, so she knew from a tender age that she had a legacy of hardiness to live up to.    During her college junior year, spent in various points around Europe, she started entertaining fellow students and travelers with tales of high fantasy and adventure inspired by her travels, which she scrawled in a series of wire-bound notebooks.  Back in the states, while attempting to make her living in the world's two lowest-paying professions--acting and writing--she appeared (briefly) in a number of commercials and films, toured with dinner theater companies and spent years performing in theater product ions around the northwest.  She also played several roles for a jousting and armored stage combat theatrical troupe known as The Seattle Knights, started and directed by artist and fight director Dameon Willich.  Eventually the two married, and from there came something of a career switch, as Darragh learned to joust, fight in armor, wield a sword and shield with conviction, and shoot arrows and lance helpless lettuce heads from a galloping horse, all in the name of entertainment. Her publishing credits include plays, non-fiction articles, interviews, novels, and short stories.  An amateur musician, she sings, arranges music, and writes songs for two music groups.  Though retired from active jousting, she's still an avid horsewoman, and loves trail riding in her rare and mostly stolen moments of free time.", "related": ["B00HL6Y7PK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm not sure what initially caused me to discover the tragic circumstances surrounding the greatest non-wartime maritime disaster in history, but at thirteen years old, I was knee-deep in everything I could get my hands on about the ship, its passengers, and the aftermath.At fifteen, I wrote a novel about the tragedy, an espionage novel that then sat on a shelf for fifteen years while I wrote  other things. But I never quite forgot Richard Pierce, nor his trip across the Atlantic, and when at last I found an idea worth pursuing, I brought him out, dusted him off, and inserted him into a new adventure -  of magic, faith, spirituality, and tragedy.Soon, other historical characters evolved and took shape in my mind - the courageous  and faithful John Harper stole away my heart, the fiery suffragist Margaret Brown (NOT \"Molly\") developed unique abilities, and my beloved Thomas Andrews bid his farewell to the world in a truly heroic way. I've  woven into these pages just enough truth to support the fiction; many of the details of the ship, her construction, and her passengers are correct, along with the various personalities that go along with them. It's only the magic that isn't.Or maybe it is. You never know what secrets history hides.", "related": ["B008QZAACO"], "rank": 2719360, "title": "The Secret in Belfast eBook", "author": "Charity Bishop", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
