At the proper time. When she was ovulating, and her chances of conceiving were at their best.\"Come on, heads,\" she muttered, picturing her husband, Reed, next door in his home office, studying e-mails or reading a financial report, looking fit and sexy and aloof, his mind firmly locked on the business of the day.The coin nicked the far edge of the down comforter before bouncing onto the tightly woven carpet.\"Damn.\" She rounded the four-poster, blinking in vain at the dark burgundy pattern, trying to make out the shiny disk.After a minute, she kicked off her shoes, dropped to her knees and hiked up her straight, charcoal skirt. Leaning on the heels of her hands, she peered under the bed. Was it heads or tails? And where the heck was the twenty-five thousand dollar collector coin?\"Elizabeth?\" came Reed's voice from the hallway.Guiltily, she jumped up, dusting off and straightening her hair.\"Yes?\" she called back, catching a glimpse of the open, satin-lined, rosewood coin collection box. She scooted to the chest of drawers and shut the lid.The bedroom door opened, and she struck what she hoped was a casual pose.\"Have you seen my PDA?\" he asked.\"Uh, no.\" She moved away from the dresser and spotted the coin. It was tipped up against the nightstand, winking under the glow from the Tiffany lamp.Reed glanced around the room. \"I could have sworn I put it in my pocket before I left the office.\"\"Did you call it?\" she asked, easing toward the coin, planning to camouflage it with her bare foot before his roving gaze landed on it.She sure didn't want to have to explain this one.\"Can you dial it for me?\" he asked.\"Sure.\" She lifted the bedside phone and punched in his cell number, putting herself between Reed and the coin, careful not to disturb its resting place and ruin the toss.A tone trilled from somewhere in the penthouse.\"Thanks,\" he told her, turning for the door.A few seconds later, he called \"Got it\" from the living room.Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief.She eased her foot away and checked out the coin's position. It was supported by the wood molding, just a hair off vertical. She upped the light on the three-way bulb and leaned her head down. If the nightstand hadn't got in the way, and the momentum had kept it going, it would have been… Yes! Heads.She snatched up the coin. The decision was made. She was taking her best friend's advice over that of a trained medical professional.On the surface, her decision flew in the face of common sense. But her friend Hanna knew more about her life than Dr. Wendell.Oh, the good doctor knew all about Elizabeth's physical health. He knew her hormone levels and her menstrual cycle. He'd even seen an ultrasound of her ovaries. But he didn't know about her marriage. He didn't know that she'd been fighting since her first anniversary to get back to the honesty and intimacy she and Reed had shared in the beginning.In the five years since she'd married Reed Wellington III, Elizabeth had learned that the corporation came first, the New York business community second, the extended Wellington family third, with their own marriage somewhere further down the list.She knew a baby would smooth things out. They'd both wanted one for years. A baby would give them a focal point, something to share, a way for her to fit more neatly into his world, and a reason for him to spend more time in hers. She'd been counting on a baby for a long time. But it was getting harder to convince herself that a baby alone was the answer.A baby needed a warm and loving home. Children needed to experience intimacy, emotion and authenticity. The further she and Reed drifted apart, the closer Elizabeth came to admitting that even their dream of starting a family wouldn't set things right.She carefully placed the coin back in the rosewood box, closing the lid and smoothing her fingertips over the whorls and scrolls that decorated the top. Reed had given her the liberty head coin and the rosewood box their first Christmas together. Then he'd added new coins every year. But, as the value of the collection grew, the strength of their marriage declined.Ironic, really. Back when she had only one coin, they'd joked together, shared secrets, made mistakes and laughed together. More often than not ending up on the bed or the couch or the carpet if no soft furniture was immediately handy.The first time they'd made love, it was on the padded bench of a gazebo in the massive backyard of his family's Connecticut estate. The dark, clear sky was dotted with stars. They were alone together, and Reed's kisses had turned passionate, his hands roaming the edges of the deep back of her cocktail dress. She'd felt her skin tingle, her nipples tighten and throbbing desire pool in the pit of her stomach.The time for waiting had passed. They both knew it, and he'd pulled her down on the bench. After long minutes, maybe hours of kisses and caresses, he'd dispatched her panties. Then he buried himself deep inside her. Two weeks later, he'd proposed, and she had enthusiastically talked herself into happily ever after.Her friends and family in New Hampshire had warned her against marrying a billionaire. His old family money put him in a completely different social class. And they'd told her that her and Reed's expectations of marriage might be completely different. But Elizabeth had been certain their deep love would conquer all obstacles.Now, five years later, and a whole lot less certain, she moved to the glass balcony doors of her opulent bedroom. Below her penthouse on the twelfth floor of 721 Park Avenue, traffic hummed, and the lights of the city-scape rolled off toward the horizon on this mild, October night. She tugged the heavy curtains closed.Although she'd recognized the wisdom in Hanna's advice, Elizabeth had felt better putting the decision in the hands of fate. The toss was heads, so the choice was made. She was fighting for her marriage in a different way, starting this minute.She marched back to the cherrywood chest. The pewter handle was cool under her fingertips as she slid the top drawer open. She thumbed her way through dainty nightgowns and peignoirs, making her way to the bottom of the stack.And there it was.Her stomach fluttered as she slid out the red silk negligee she'd worn on her wedding night.She unzipped the back of her skirt, shimmying out, tossing her jacket, blouse and underwear on a chair, suddenly anxious to get to Reed. She slipped into the negligee, feeling decadently beautiful for the first time in months. Then she crossed to the en suite, fluffing her auburn hair.Her eyelashes were dark and thick against her green eyes, her pupils slightly dilated. She freshened her lipstick, stroked some blush over her cheeks, then stepped back to check out the effect in the full-length mirror. Her feet were bare, toenails polished a gleaming copper, and the red silk fell mere inches down her thighs, ending in a band of sheer lace. The neckline dipped low, with more lace that barely camouflaged her breasts.As a final touch, she dabbed some perfume on her neck and dropped one of the spaghetti straps off her shoulder. Then she stretched to her full five foot five and placed a hand over her fluttering abdomen. Her three-carat diamond winked back at her in the mirror.Reed was her husband, she reminded herself. She had every right to seduce him. Besides, Hanna would be proud.She headed across the bedroom, switching off the lamp and padding down the hallway.\"Reed?\" she cooed softly, emerging into the doorway of his office, snaking her arm up the cool doorjamb and striking a pose.Two men looked up from where they were reading a letter.At the sight of his wife's sexy outfit, Reed's jaw fell open, the wordsinsider tradingvanishing from his mind. The Securities and Exchange Commission's letter slipped from his fingers to the desktop while, beside him, his vice president, Collin Killian, sucked in a shocked breath.It took Collin a full three seconds to think to turn away. Reed supposed he couldn't blame the man. It took Elizabeth five seconds to squeak out a gasp and flee down the hall.\"Uh…\" Collin began, peering cautiously over his shoulder at the now empty doorway.Reed swore as he rose to his feet and heard the bedroom door slam shut.Collin reached for his briefcase. \"Catch you later.\"\"You stay put,\" Reed commanded, striding across the room.\"But—\"\"I just found out I'm being investigated by the SEC. You and I need to talk.\"\"But your wife—\"\"I'll talk to her first.\" What was Elizabeth thinking? He rounded the corner into the hall.Collin called behind him, \"I don't think talking is what she has in mind.\"Reed didn't bother answering.Elizabeth had no business doing anythingbuttalking. He wasn't the one monitoring her basal body temperature, but he was pretty sure they were days ahead of schedule. He missed spontaneous lovemaking as much as she must, but he also wanted to be a father. And he knew damn well she wanted to be a mother. Programmed lovemaking was frustrating. But it was a sacrifice worth making.He put his hand on the doorknob, forcing himself to pause, steeling his hormones for the sight he knew waited inside. His wife was a knockout, a sexy, sensual, stunning knockout, but he had to be strong for both of them.He turned the knob and carefully opened the door.\"Elizabeth?\"\"Go away.\" Her voice was muffled as she wrapped a terry robe protectively around herself. A stream of light from the en suite backlit her as he shut the door and moved into the room.\"What's going on?\" he asked softly.She shook her head. \"Nothing.\"He longed to draw her into his arms, maybe slip his hands into the soft terry cloth and pull her tight against his bod...", "related": [], "rank": 1225493, "title": "Marriage, Manhattan Style (Park Avenue Scandals Book 1897)", "author": "Barbara Dunlop", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Married to a French scientist, Isabela Godin des Odonais, the daughter of the Spanish governor of Ecuador, waits patiently for safe passage to French Guiana, where her devoted husband awaits her. Unfortunately, tensions between the rival colonial French, Spanish, and Portuguese governments prevent either Isabela or her husband from traveling across the continent to meet one another. Nearly 20 years later, Isabela, her extended family, and her servants are finally allowed to undertake the arduous 3,000-mile trek across the Andes and through the jungle. Facing every possible hazard along the way, the party of 42 is reduced to one survivor: a half-mad Isabela, who is finally reunited with her husband.

Nothing good, some may feel, especially if they don't take seriously Hines' stated intent \"to recapture for the modern reader some of the vigor and excitement the original audience must have felt\" for the third-millennium B.C.E. tale of the giant Gilgamesh, his friend Enkidu, their exploits, Enkidu's death, and Gilgamesh's quest for immortality and subsequent resignation to human limitations. For Hines, giving the story renewed impact means a total rewrite in punchy free verse that incorporates dialect passages and the odd neologism as well as modern jargon. The results are racy, flippant, and sometimes perverse, as when Hines completely elides the old poem's thousand-years-before-Genesis account of a worldwide flood. Apparently the flood episode grants more power to the gods than Hines can stomach, at least if he shares the opinion he gives the dying Enkidu: that his and Gilgamesh's story proves, however imperfectly, \"that we are the gods.\" This isGilgameshfor the New Age.Ray OlsonCopyright © American Library Association.

But when the cryptic Bartleby enters the story, the stakes are raised to that of a spiritual drama. William Roberts captures the office comedy nicely and also the mounting anguish of the narrator trying and failing to be his brother's keeper. The narrator's glimpse into the void gives Roberts the chance to create tension in the later scenes by suggesting the apprehensions of this naïve but kindhearted man. Also included are the much shorter stories \"The Lightning-Rod Man\" and \"The Bell-Tower.\"  G.H. © AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine--Copyright © AudioFile, Portland, Maine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The champagne was flowing. There were red roses by the dozen on every table, and fairy lights lit the satin-draped walls. She wore a watered-silk dress of softest silver green and the McLachlan family diamond necklace, earrings and bracelet set, all supplied by her adoring fiancé.Given the stress of the past nine months, after Matt's father's death and the near collapse of both his business and hers, it felt amazing that they were here now.Well, amazing thatshewas here, anyway. Matt fitted into this world perfectly.The cream of Boston society—all childhood friends of Matt's—filled the room and spilled out onto the terrace. Her own family hadn't been able to make it from Sydney at such short notice. But her friends, affectionately known as The Wedding Belles, because they ran a complete-weddingpackage business in Boston, were here either with their own wonderful men or working the room. They were creating new business just by being there, because they were responsible for this \"wedding of the year.\"Her wedding.Julie shook her head, as if to clear it.She, plain, publicity-shy Julie Montgomery from Rockdale, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, was the bride in what the media had dubbed Boston's Wedding of the Year. She, just a simple general assistant for The Wedding Belles, had captured the heart of Boston's most eligible bachelor. Why they'd chosen her wedding, she didn't know, any more than she knew why a man like Matt had ever fallen for someone like her.Why she'd fallen for him was no mystery. She looked across the room at him, and her heart almost burst with pride and love. Tall and lithe, he wore the tux as though he'd been born in it, which, given his family background, he probably had been. His dark hair curled just enough to look sexily mussed; she loved the light streaks of early grey about his ears and temples, which always made her fingers ache to plunge right in there. His eyes—what woman could look into that ice-blue perfection and not do what she'd done the first minute she'd seen him? Intelligent, kind and strong, he could never see someone in need without doing something about it, whether helping out at charity events or donating funds to needy causes. If she'd fallen in love with him at a glance, she'd fallen even deeper for the man beneath, the man of integrity and generosity. He worked hard, had true creative genius, and a heart that never stopped giving.And thosehands…what he could do to her with a touch!He'd been so busy lately, and, oh, how she'd missed him. But tonight was theirs, their engagement party, and he was hers alone. Needing to be near him, she smiled and detached herself from her future mother-in-law and began to go to him.\"Miss Montgomery, could we have a minute for a few questions?\"Julie held in the sigh. This was one part of her engagement she found less than appealing. As the love interest of Matthew McLachlan, president of McLachlan Marine Industries since his father's death, she was subject to public scrutiny. It was almost like being part of a second marriage. She could always count on the presence of the press in her life, during both the good times and definitely through the bad.The Belles had come up with the idea of throwing them a wedding when it looked like Matt was going to lose the company after his father's wildly unsuccessful speculations. Since then her private love story had become public entertainment. The invitation list for the quiet family wedding The Belles had planned was now up to over 150, and the simple garden venue was now the cathedral on the harbour front, which had room for media photo shoots and the live television feed. Their wedding had become an official \"human interest story,\" and was being followed by a top magazine, three tabloids and two TV stations covering the tristate area.But all the media interest had also saved The Belles from going under when the high-society Vandiver wedding cancellation had left them deep in the red; so Julie's every smile for the cameras held as much gratitude and relief as it did resentment.She turned now, with the smile that had felt more like a grimace for the past few months. \"Of course… Jemima, isn't it?\"Jemima Whittaker ofBoston People Today, the magazine covering her wedding, beamed at her. \"So good of you to remember.\"Remember? It was impossible not to when the woman had been in her face almost constantly for the past few months.\"So how do you feel about your fiancé's phenomenal success in saving McLachlan Marine Industries from financial flatlining?\"Her gaze flicked to Matt, talking to some people she didn't recognise in the centre of the room—probably more members of the press—and she felt her smile soften with the love she couldn't hide. \"I'm incredibly proud of him, of course, but I knew he could do it. He's so dedicated to his workers and their families.\"\"Your fiancé didn't just save jobs, Miss Montgomery. The new water converter he's invented will revolutionise the industry.\" The reporter sounded one point less than smug with the information. \"The new contracts with Jet Stream Industries and Red Line Marine—not to mention the giants in the motor industry showing marked interest in a land prototype—will give McLachlan's more power and wealth than it's known in its eighty-year history. Matt's done more than rescue the company from the investment mistakes of his father—he's become a multimillionaire, is being hailed as awunderkind,and has been nominated for businessman of the year after he gave shares in the converter to every McLachlan's worker that waited for their overdue salaries. Many of them are now well on their way to being rich. How do you feel about that?\"It took all of Julie's willpower to not blink or frown. Matt had enjoyed so much success in the public arena, had done so much more than save the company, and he hadn't told her? \"As I said, I always knew he was a genius,\" she replied with another halfway-to-grimace smile, wondering why this reporter knew so much about the importance of Matt's invention, while she, his fiancée, knew nothing.\"I suppose you think so because he chose you instead of Sara Enderby or Elise Pettifer,\" Jemima laughed, totally without spite—probably because, like Julie herself, she came from less exalted origins than most in the room. Jemima's hand swept to where Matt stood in a crowd of people, laughing—and it was only then Julie realised that six of the eight people surrounding him were very attractive women. \"You're one secure woman, obviously. If Matthew McLachlan were my fiancé, and he had two very beautiful exes making him laugh the way those women are right now, I'd drape myself over him faster than Speedy Gonzalez.\" She laughed again as she said, \"Or kick them out of the way like that baby kangaroo on the cartoons.\"The two exquisite blondes on either side of him were hisex-girlfriends?Self-control.Julie held her hands at her sides, refusing to check the current state of her French twist. Her bright-red French twist. She didn't smooth her hands over her lightly applied makeup. She knew the freckles showed anyway.\"With Elise in particular, everyone was taking bets on the wedding date,\" Jemima went on, still without malice but with a good deal of curiosity. Digging. \"She's an engineer, too, you know. In fact, I've heard rumours that she worked with him on the design of the water converter. They seemed the perfect match. That's why there was such interest when he broke up with her, and was seen with you so soon after.\"A perfect match…oh, weren't they just? The handsome, high-born genius and the beautiful, high-society woman, one of his own people, who made him laugh so easily. Perfection, side by side….Julie had met both women earlier, but hadn't thought much about either of them afterward. They'd seemed nice women, without any sign of cattiness in their conversation or demeanour. Not by word or act had they shown anything but kindness to her.But then, why would they need to compete, when they were so beautiful?Then she remembered the look in Matt's eyes when he'd seen her tonight, and the world seemed to spin the right way again. \"You'll have to ask Matt about who he works with and why. That's his place. Thanks for the advice, but after all, those women are in his past—I'm his future. I'm the one wearing his ring.\" With a cool smile she ended the interview.But she didn't continue toward Matt. That might make it seem as if she didn't trust him, which could create fodder for a speculative story about the status of their relationship. She'd had enough of that in the past few months.Finally the night was over, his gift to Julie. Now, after all his months of work to save McLachlan's, he could be alone with the woman he loved.Matthew McLachlan smiled, almost bursting with the pride and love he felt. In a love story filled with obstacles—from his father's opposition to Matt falling for an unknown Australian woman, to the intense media speculation, to the problems with his business and hers—Julie had risen to every occasion. She'd won everyone over with her quirky humour, her strength, grace and dignity. An extraordinary woman… and she was all his. His woman, his love.He'd known she felt intimidated by the overwhelming media and social interest in their lives, especially since The Belles'plans for their wedding had become public knowledge. He'd seen her trepidation about tonight. Then he'd given her the dress he'd bought for her on his last trip to New York and the McLachlan diamonds his mother had brought down for her, the possession of all the future McLachlan brides. He'd seen the utter delight in being so spoiled fill her face, the excitement at being the belle of the ball, as he'd jokingly called her, playing on her job at The Wedding ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She reluctantly leaves her Brooklyn home for unfamiliar surroundings, apprehensive about being one of only five African American students at the school. She soon meets three older African American enrollees, who boast of their affluent backgrounds and isolate her from the other girls--including Pauli, the offspring of a mixed marriage, whom they detest for \"assimilating.\" Maizon resents such manipulation, and the trio consequently shuns her. Erecting a shield against further hurt, the girl becomes achingly lonely. Maizon senses she's an oddity at the essentially all-white Blue Hill and in her frank and engaging narrative admits to resisting the place, where racial insults are often seen in innocuous remarks--yet in fact only the three African American girls indulge in obviously bigoted comments. This simply told, finely crafted sequel to Last Summer with Maizon neatly avoids predictability while offering a perspective on racism and elitism rarely found in fiction for this age group.

A bold new collection by relentlessly surprising Scottish author Kennedy (Day) finds her characters pinned somewhere between love and pain. In the title story, about a lone man's evening attending a smalltown cinema, the denouement comes very gradually, as it does frequently throughout, reflecting a kind of reluctant dawning of consciousness: the protagonist, a forensics expert traumatized by having seen so much carnage, has left his wife after the death of their young daughter, an event that has rendered them unable to stand the guilt and anger evoked by the other's presence. Wasps captures a young wife and mother as she is making a Sunday breakfast. This seemingly typical scene is frozen by the menace of the philandering husband's leaving for good and his icy treatment of his angry wife. Saturday Teatime depicts the panicked delayed memory shock experienced by a child listening to her father's abuse of her mother, while Marriage portrays the excruciating emotional and physical aftermath of a violent sexual encounter between a husband and wife. These stories are polished to perfection, full of very dark turns and exemplary of Kennedy's inventiveness.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the story we all wish we could write! It is one of the most deep, soul touching, more profound novels I have ever read. The depth of the despair and love that these three characters feel is unequaled to anything I have ever experienced through a book. This is a story of love and loss, of rejection and acceptance, of life and death, of hope and rebirth. You will cry your eyes out - it was a deeply cathartic read for me.Beautifully written, with characters that will get under your skin, and you will embrace, with a depth of humanity unparalleled to any other book I have read, poetic and raw at the same time. Hope; hope is the word that defines this book: hope in spite of certain death, hope in spite of rejection and abuse, hope resulting from true unconditional love. Hope that heals, hope that forgives, hope that is the way to rebirth. Love as the only important thing worth living for. Alex will find love - both spiritual and physical - through the love shared by Steve and Matthew, a love that will grow to embrace her, too, and help her exorcise the demons of her very abusive childhood. And healing will come on the wings of a butterfly.This book is a definite MUST READ. No holds barred, no caveats. This book will show you pure, unadulterated love and hope through tears and loss.~ Maria Snell -- Flair", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 3337092, "title": "The Soul Bearers", "author": "Sylvia Massara", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 48.0}

What could beat that?Sixteen-year-old Hattie, in an expressive, quirky yet pitch-perfect first-person voice, provides the flowing narrative, as she steals Speed, an ancient horse scheduled to be put down the following autumn morning (merely to prevent the possibility of a difficult winter burial) and heads west with her best friend, Delores. She’s an emotionally fragile 18-year-old, rejected by her boyfriend-focused mother, and needs a rescue almost as badly as the horse. Their goal is to find free range for Speed, offering him the opportunity, for once in his life, to just be a horse—free, not plodding around a carnival ring. Along the way they encounter other horse lovers, most notably Julie, an elderly woman who just wants to share a few heart-wrenching moments with patient Speed; Fry, a Minnesota double amputee with plenty of land and a big heart; and Punch, a handsome young rodeo rider who loves both horses and Hattie. Monniger’s writing is delicious, evocative and, especially during horse-focused scenes, moving.Horse story, road trip, coming-of-age tale: It's any and all of these, but mostly a tender and authentic voyage into the mind of a wise, funny and wholly likable protagonist.(Fiction. 11 & up)From the Hardcover edition.", "related": ["B007RP4KTI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she comes to, she discovers a bludgeoned, faceless body beside herAquite possibly Eddie's. The LAPD rushes to accuse Zen of the murder, but before they can arrest her, her new pal Sherrie Sangar kidnaps her at gunpoint, then tries to get the LAPD to shoot them both.

Throughout his teenage years, he edited various magazines and was a freelance journalist for many music and art-related publications. Bear Step is a veteran of the early 80s Chicago Hardcore Punk Rock scene and played guitar in Negative Element and many other Punk Rock bands. He and his band are featured in the movie, You Weren't There: A History of Chicago Punk 1977-1984. In his early twenties, he became deeply inspired by the tropical imagery of Pablo Neruda and the surrealistic madness of Salvador Dali. He published his first book, Silence Broken and other Poems in 1988. Step moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 1990 and became an integral part of the Café Diem Poets for over five years. The Café Diem Poets held monthly poetry readings, published The Shaky Table monthly journal and performed poetry readings at nightclubs, bookstores and radio stations across Georgia. Step also performed at the Lollapalooza festival in the mid 1990s. One of his live performances is captured in the movie, Coffeehouse: Atlanta's Underground Poets. In 1993, Step published the magazine, Libre, featuring articles highlighting local writers and artists. The magazine featured his famous fictional interview with Salvador Dali. He later had two poems published in Mudfish #7 from New York City. Step published his second book of poetry entitled, Palabaras Oscuras: Poems of Sweat from the Tropic Eye in 1995. He was nominated as \"Georgia Author of the Year\" at Kennesaw University in 1996 and hosted occasional spoken word radio programs on WREK FM at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He co-published Cultural Exploring Magazine in 1998 and served as the co-owner of Nuevo Impacto Magazine from 2001 to 2006. From 2001 through 2008, Step traveled extensively throughout Latin American.

For the past seven years, Nick has lived in the land of never ending sunshine, Palm Springs; after ten years under the shade of towering redwoods along the Russian River. He moved to San Francisco in 1976, still a teenager at 19. The first bar he snuck into was The Bolt. In those more carefree days of the 70’s, there was never a doorman and the older leather crowd greeted the handsome sailor-looking, under age boy, with open arms. Nick was hooked from the start and never looked back. For you newcomers, the more modern name for The Bolt is The Powerhouse. Soon after, a friend gave him a leather vest. To keep warm on those cold San Francisco summer nights he bought a Leather Motorcycle Jacket at Hard On Leather on Polk Street.

While still an undergraduate he began work on the little magazine Nomad (1959-1962) - which he co-edited with Donald Factor.

He taught a variety of courses in Western Civilization, literature and contemporary culture here, and published a number of articles on popular culture topics, American and British. Indeed, the Linicks began to spend more and more time in England, including a sabbatical year begun in 1979; in 1981 they moved to London. Here Anthony began a twenty-year teaching career at the American School in London, in St. John's Wood, offering many courses, first in the high school social studies department and then in the English department - where he served as department head from 1994 to 2002, the year he retired. Dorothy also worked at the American School as a special projects coordinator; she had also held the post of director of student services at the American College in London. She died in July, 2007. Since his retirement Anthony has been at work on a number of writing projects, including two earlier volumes in the dog people of Paddington Rec cycle, Strictly Come Barking and Have I Got Dogs For You! - as well as The Lives of Ingolf Dahl, a biography of his stepfather, and A Walker's Alphabet, Adventures on the long-distance footpaths of Great Britain.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then came wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, the Tao Te Ching, Zen, the Buddha’s Dhammapada, Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, the cosmos, and then from myself.  My watchwords were practice and rationality, respect for the ancient wisdom tempered by science.  Enlightenments came and went.  Some stayed.  Probably the most important of these was the realization that we never die, that we are always alive. I hope that readers of this book will learn the simple but stunning truth that we are always alive.  The fear of death will dissipate like dark clouds chased by the sun and a sense of freedom and lightness will ensue, elevating the spirit.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

D.M. O'Neal's expertise in the science of crime scene investigation makes for an exciting read. The twists and turns of the plot will keep you off-balance but captivated.A Stunning Debut Novel From a Major New TalentHow do you properly review a book without relying on clichés, when those clichés are uniquely appropriate? I'm talking about words and phrases like \"spellbinding\" ... \"couldn't put it down\" ... \"ingenious\" ... \"masterful\" ... \"devilishly clever\" ...It takes a talented writer to pull off such a complicated storyline, and D. M. O'Neal displays the same kind of dazzling talent that is the hallmark of such respected authors as John Grisham, Ruth Rendell, and even Dame Agatha Christie. \"Shambles\" deserves the widest possible audience.Emerson once said, \"Fiction reveals truth that reality obscures.\" I was delighted to learn that the reality I had created along the way was entirely obscured and the author led me to a twisted conclusion! It was a delightful surprise. The reality is . . . you are given an enchanting investigation into crime scene science and real life emotions.When you first start reading O'Neal's book you're just picking at the scab of a deep wound. You think you know what you're reading, but when you get around to the halfway point of the story, you realize the narrator has been somewhat less that forthcoming. About what, I won't say, ...\"Shambles damned near twisted my head off with the direction turn in the middle. I did not see that coming. Good stuff.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her only goal in life is to find the lost treasure of the Mission of Santa Isabel so she will be set up for life and not be forced into service by her old boss, saloon/dance hall owner, Tully Thatcher.  When Paris' card dealing father is killed, Paris steals back from Tully the supposed map to the legendary mission.  Now, disguised as a nun, all Paris has to do is hire the best bounty hunter/tracker to take her across the Sonoran desert in search of the mission and it's hidden wealth.  Nataniel Brannigan is not amused by the woman posing as a nun, claiming she is in search of the treasure for her parish.  But he is intrigued, and as there is currently nothing for him to do in Nogales, he figures he'll earn an easy two hundred dollars when Sister Frances discovers the impossibility of finding a mission that men have searched for for decades, only to succumb to it's curse, or the inhospitality of the desert.  Nate is soon frustrated beyond words at Paris' unwavering determination to obtain the treasure, nearly getting them both killed on more than one occasion.  Withholding the truth from him, lying to him, as well as his brother who also nearly dies, and not to mention drugging him and leaving him without his horse in the desert just because he does not share her desire to find any treasure, is more than anyone can take.  Then there is the obvious fact that she wants what rightfully belongs to a church anyway, and it is soon clear she is no nun!  But Nate tries to understand what is driving Paris to act the way she does, and why he is starting to have feelings for her, regardless of how she treats him.  Meanwhile, Paris is wondering if the curse is real after all, and she is finding herself wishing Nate could take the place of any treasure and take care of her himself.  She is certain it is just her bad luck to love a man who wants nothing to do with her.  I spent much time frustrated with Paris and her drive, feeling that no man in his right mind would put up with her, but by the end of the book - and it does keep you hooked - you realize that Linda Sandifer has the ability to create a character unlike any she has done before, and, even though you still may not agree with Paris' reasoning, you feel that only these two characters could have brought out the best in each other.  It works!Ms. Sandifer sizzles once again with passions that ignite the pages! Ms. Sandifer takes a darker side of human nature and turns it right side out.

Simeon, decidely heterosexual, is close to tying the knot with longtime lady friend Eleanor, when he's hired by a dying man who believes his elderly lover, Max, is in mortal danger. The man is right: Max is soon the victim of a homophobic serial killer who slices his victims open and then writes home to their families to reveal the secret of their sexuality. The wit of Hallinan's previous Simeon outings is still in evidence here (he begins with a coyly sinister introduction to the murderer), but some of these issues, e.g., uncertain sexual orientation and self-loathing, are hard matters to successfully crack wise over. Now nearing 40, Simeon seems a bit old for the whining angst that impending nuptials inspire in him.

At the age of 49, she had a spiritual awakening that led her on a journey to understand her childhood abuse and gift of knowing. After writing The Blessing of Abuse, she moved to northern Colorado and currently teaches a writing class at a local community college, Healing from Writing, an 8-week workshop devoted to understanding childhood abuse through the writing of your own spiritual autobiography. She is currently writing her second book, My Soul’s Journey, Experiences. She supports and champions the fight for children's rights in Colorado and all over the world. Laurie's story, from an abusive childhood to a life filled with Spirit, is engaging, moving and inspiring. She writes candidly and at times even humorously, as we travel with her through her childhood terror to the awakening of her gifts and life purpose, from fear and anger to understanding the greater meaning of her life experiences and finding forgiveness. -Sheila Bray, Ph.D Laurie has traveled down the road of child abuse but did not let it ruin her. She has turned the experiences into something positive and good by showing the resilience of the human spirit. By bringing Spirituality into her life, and reaching out to God and the Angels, she has redesigned herself to be the strong, confident woman she is today. I am proud to call her my friend. -Judith Statezny Ulch", "related": [], "rank": 2110549, "title": "The Blessing of Abuse (My Soul's Journey Book 1)", "author": "Laurie Stinson", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was encouraged at an early age to write by his English teacher and went on to read English at Birmingham University. While an undergraduate, he started to develop the radio play format for which he first became known. At the age of twenty-one he sold a play to the BBC and continued to write following his graduation while working as a stockbroker’s clerk. In 1938, by this time writing full time, he created the character Paul Temple, a crime novelist and detective. With Steve Trent, a Fleet Street journalist and later his wife, Temple solved numerous crimes. Durbridge’s style was very much in the mode of the earlier Golden Age middle-class amateur detectives. The first book,Send for Paul Temple, was written along with John Thewes as the novelization of a radio serial. Many others followed and they were hugely successful until the last of the series was completed in 1968.", "related": ["B004X2WYVE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No, not an electric one. A real antique, made of metal and heavier than a wet coffin. Her first professional novel was Killing Time - the controversial Star Trek book which was recalled and re-edited in 1984. None of the rumors were true, of course. It was just a Star Trek book - but apparently a good enough work that the \"reboot\" movie borrowed heavily from the plot and structure. No kidding.Della has written extensively in the non-fiction genre, with titles such as Quantum Shaman: Diary of a Nagual Woman and Scrawls On the Walls of the Soul. Quantum Shaman focuses heavily on the author's metaphysical explorations and experiences, while Scrawls is a continuation of those journeys many years later. If you enjoyed the works of Carlos Castaneda or Don Miguel Ruiz, you'll enjoy the non-fiction works of Della Van Hise.In addition, Della has written professionally for Tomorrow Magazine and other prominent science fiction publications. Her fiction works include Ragged Angels (an award-winning vampire novel); Year of the Ram (a space-faring gay romance); and Coyote (a novel of love, honor & personal sacrifice, combining the mystical elements of martial arts and the romantic conflict of a young woman torn between two powerful men.)", "related": ["B00DW1KADG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book includes many helpful worked examples. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through researchers/faculty.” [P. Cull, Choice, Vol. 50 (8), April, 2013]“There is no doubt that discrete mathematics is a mandatory component of any good computer science program. Therefore, a textbook for this area is always very useful. … this book particularly emphasizes the difference between the algorithmic and the descriptive approach. … topics are well presented and can be used immediately for teaching such a course. It is also very helpful that many exercises are included into the text and support the learning process.” [Christian Posthoff, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1254, 2013]“The overwhelming majority of the subjects is discussed from an algorithmic viewpoint, considering how we could use this or that result while writing code for a computer. … you want to teach a course focusing on how to use discrete structures in computer science, then the book is a concise, low-cost alternative to textbooks in discrete mathematics.” (Miklós Bóna, MAA Reviews, December, 2012)“The standard topics--including propositional logic, predicate calculus, sets, relations, discrete structures, defining new structured types, numbers, and reasoning about programs--are covered … . As such, the book is suitable for students who understand algebra and can program. … Teachers who use this text have noted how enthusiastically their students discuss its ideas in class. … Overall, the book is well made.” [Richard Botting, ACM Computing Reviews, December, 2012]\"Profound knowledge and skills in discrete mathematics are mandatory for a well educated computer scientist. Therefore a corresponding curriculum typically requires at least a basic course on this subject. This textbook, which is based on the lectures given by the author at the University of Malta, is a perfect companion for every student taking such a course. ... Besides a thorough formal presentation the book always gives a convincing motivation for studying the corresponding structures and explains the main ideas using illustrations. A well chosen set of exercises rounds off each topic. After studying the presented material a computer science student will be well prepared for further, more specialized courses.\" [Martin Leucker, Lübeck]", "related": [], "rank": 1876227, "title": "Mathematics of Discrete Structures for Computer Science", "author": "Gordon J.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans. It's the perfect human storm.\"", "related": [], "rank": 1430666, "title": "Where's Hansel and Gretel's Gingerbread House?

Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well. Best known for his exuberant proclamation that \"Jesus is Lord!\", Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness. Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions. Through these KCM outreaches, every day thousands of believers from Jacksonville to Johannesburg are moving from defeat, self-doubt and discouragement - to a life of God-given victory.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Originally thought to be applicable only to a rather small subset of infertile women, today busy practices commonly recommend the procedure and it is estimated that nearly all of the 400 or more IVF programs in the United States provide these services. Oocyte and embryo donation has established itself as a mainstay procedure within assisted reproductive care, and the breadth, depth and complexity of practice is deserving of focused attention.Much has changed within the field of oocyte and embryo donation since the publication of the first edition ofPrinciples of Oocyte and Embryo Donationin 1998, thus the need for a completely updated and more expansive text. The second edition of this book provides an overview of the major issues affecting men and women engaged in the practice of oocyte and embryo donation.  A primary emphasis has been placed on defining the standards of practice that have evolved over the past 30 years, clearly stating the outcomes expected from adhering to these established protocols.  Details of both the basic science and the clinical medicine are presented together and attention is also focused on the non-reproductive aspects inherent to this unique method of assisted reproduction that involves opinions from lawyers, ethicists, mental health care professionals and theologians. Oocyte and embryo donation requires a working knowledge of the medicine, the law and the ethics that underlies its foundation. This book is intended to serve as a complete and comprehensive reference for all health care professionals that provide services related to egg donation, reproductive endocrinologists, obstetrician- gynecologists, and fellows and residents entering the fertility field.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nearly a decade later, while attending university for her degree in Social Sciences and Psychology--which no doubt lends help with getting into the \"heads\" of her characters,  and understanding that pesky thing called human nature, as well as that of the fickle heart--she at long last became inspired to write her very first romance novel, one that she could call her own.

And she's felt like a proud mama ever since. No matter what.Miss Westland's profound hope is to one day come full circle and be the author of the very first romance novel that another someone happens to pick up, perhaps memorably changing their lifepath forever as well.", "related": [], "rank": 2624728, "title": "The Legacy of Blood (The Sanguivore Saga Book 1)", "author": "Shelby Westland", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After attending Miami University, Wendy went onto a career in the visual arts. After several years of creating and selling her own artwork she gave her first love, writing, a try. Her first novel flowed from her in only two weeks time (then the real work started with four months of editing). That moment was when she knew she had found her calling. Wendy now happily spends her days writing the stories her characters guide her to tell, admitting even she doesn't always know where that might lead. When she's not writing, this dog lover can be found spending time with her tech geek husband, their three amazing kids, and two pups. She loves to cook and is a film fanatic.

I just wanted to share my reasons for writing this particular story. I was talking to my husband one night about story ideas, and we hit upon the question what would happen if a wealthy young woman fell in love with a blue collar, working-class man - like a police officer. It's a concept that I've always been interested in because we hear all these studies about how men desire to be the bread winner and how they feel intimidated if a woman makes more money than they do. Plus, I kept reading romances where the hero was always this wealthy, corporate tycoon and the heroine is the one who comes from nothing, and I just wanted to switch that up a little. So, the Pierced Trilogy is sort of my stab at that underused dynamic. I hope you enjoy it!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story deals with how a certain strata of the society accept him and how the rest do not. The backdrop of the story is a music conservatory in Italy. For me the theme is bold and daring. It's not every day that you read stories on castrated men or eunuchs. So it's kudos to the writer for deciding to write on such a topic and taking some risks in his work. He has handled the theme very well. The emotions experienced by the castrated teenager, Leonardo Ponti, are portrayed very well. Vincenzo Spina, the meanest teacher in the conservatory, Gianni Scala, Leonardo's best friend, Cesare, the worst bully in the conservatory and actress Martina who has a soft corner for Leonardo are all strong characters that remain in the reader's mind even after finishing the book. Each one is unique and they dominate the story in their own way. Though The Not Wholes has many dark moments, the opera scenes are rich and descriptive. It gives another angle to the otherwise somber theme. The story flows nicely and there much suspense to keep the reader glued to the pages. The book is a kind of motivation for writers who want to tackle bold themes and controversial topics but who do not have the courage to experiment and try out new ideas.", "related": [], "rank": 2662086, "title": "The Not Wholes", "author": "Giovanna Pezzulo", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 19.0}

The only thing he was anxious to do was continue his online job hunting. He had a degree in Accounting and he wanted to put it to use as soon as possible. A nice cozy desk in a cubicle absent of large, smelly men looked like paradise right about now.Xavier read the last two names. He noticed that the second name was written and not printed like the others. Xavier figured that the guy had been transferred from one of the other units. He took his keys from his hip and unlocked the heavy door. He swung it open and stepped inside so that the door leaned against his back. Xavier opened his mouth to say the names as he looked up. But before a word could cross his lips he choked up.The sight before Xavier burned through his cornea. What he saw didn't totally shock him but it definitely caught him off guard. He'd been warned of what he would likely be seeing in a prison setting during orientation after he got hired. But it was one thing to be told something and another to witness it firsthand.A wiry yet muscular man was on the top bunk stroking his dick. Xavier's eyes slowly moved up and down the young man's midnight black skin; almost as slowly as the new inmate slid his manhood through his long, slicked fingers. Xavier wasn't gay but he couldn't pull his eyes away. His inability to look away bothered him deeply. The sight, just like the name Raheem Jones, seared in his mind.What struck Xavier the most was that Raheem hadn't moved to cover himself. He didn't stop. He just kept grinding his hips into his hand. With each slow, measured thrust upwards Raheem gripped every inch of his ridiculously thick pole. His body seemed to throb as one single, ripped muscle, flexing and releasing over and over again.Xavier's breath quickened as he heard a soft moan escape through Raheem's lips. He panicked for a moment. His eyes moved outside the cell to see if anyone was looking and then quickly darted down to Raheem's bunk mate. The burly man still had his large back to the cell door and Xavier. He hadn't moved. Xavier locked his gaze back on the inmate's slightly sweat moistened body.Raheem, who barely looked over eighteen, tilted his head back against the hard mattress, seemingly oblivious to his onlooker.

Having spent several years servicing aircraft engines, with stints in strife-torn Cyprus and hot and dusty Malta, he was posted to Singapore. Here he took on a new job, policing and administrating the men of RAF Changi’s technical wing. Singapore Island, newly federated with Malaya, was, at that time, feeling its way towards independence, amid much trauma and belligerence. British soldiers, sailors and airmen found themselves acting both as peacemakers during the riots and targets for the Malayan Communist Party’s ferocious Guerrillas. A medal—the Service to Malay Award—has been issued to all who took part in the campaign, including TB. At the end of his tour, Terence Brand decided to exchange battledress for sports jacket and flannels and try his luck in civvie street. A love of music and its quality reproduction in the home drew him to the rarefied world of the British hi-fi industry. Inevitably, becoming a part of it entailed retraining in electronics. At last, after several years working in Radio and TV servicing, a chance came to get involved in his first love. Entering the retail business as a salesman, he eventually assumed the management/directorship of a highly respected Hi-Fi emporium. After twenty-five years in retail, early retirement beckoned. Seeking something different to occupy his mind, he started to write.  A series of short stories set in Singapore describing the adventures of Senior Aircraftsmen John Newton and Red Halliday —under the collective title: On the Changi Beat— has won prizes; a group of novels featuring a dramatically maturing Frank ‘Red’ Halliday are receiving welcome interest. (Red’s Rebels, Mediterranean Red, The Angels See Red, and, in preparation, Red Sleuths in the Sunset).

Not having many friends to talk to other than the cats and dogs, she started writing in order to alleviate the excess of words swirling through her brain. And she happened to be none too shabby at it. Her earliest work debuted in third grade with a poem about a brown cat. From there she never really stopped. By high school, her creative writing teacher offered to be her literary agent both times she took the class. Still, feeling like a little bitty fish in a very big pond, she kept her writing mostly to herself and got lost in everyday life. She met people, now and then, that would fan the spark of writing into flame once again. She would share her work with them. She would be inspired to write and write and write some more. But always, after a while, she would let it die back again to embers and return to the day to day grind. Until finally, one day, she realized half her life was gone and she still wasn't what she was meant to be. But now, she is determined enough to finish what she had started and get her work out there. She has published three books featuring her poetry and photography: Where Moonflowers Bloom, The Tincture of a Radiant Madness and In Just a Few Small Words.  She has several more poetry books, two flash fiction collections and a short story collection in the works.  She also has several novels in progress as well and is currently focusing on a science fiction novel that she plans to publish as an eBook. She lives in Texas with a man and a menagerie.

I'm happy to report that my writing life has almost completely taken over my tour directing life. With that combination, it's easy to understand why my novellas contain travel to exotic locations. I've been living in Indonesia since 1982, and I've carved out my own little piece of paradise that I share with my dogs, my business partner, and our employees. Originally, I came to Indonesia because I was feeling frustrated with the path I was following.  I'd gone back to school to become a clinical psychologist; and although I loved studying psychology, I felt that a career in that field was going to tie me down too much.  I'd always loved traveling and felt that I even wanted to live and work overseas. Along came a job in Indonesia - for only 3 months.  Well, I figured a short time living and working overseas would get that itch out of my system.  But as you already know, 3 months wasn't enough time to get rid of that restless bug. When that short job ended, I'd already decided that I wanted to stay in Indonesia.  Living overseas was the adventure I wanted to continue. I ended up teaching English in Indonesia for around 13 years and then switched to tour directing for 18 years. I still lead some tours, mainly to Russia and the Baltics, but I spend most of my time writing. For a very long time, a good friend of mine named Jeannette kept saying that I should be writing books.  I always loved writing and kept a journal on and off over the years.  But I wasn't sure that I had enough to say to write a whole book.  Well, I'm now finding out that I have more than enough to say.  And it's been amazing to me that my books have been selling very nicely - both as ebooks and as paperbacks. Once I saw that strangers would buy something that I'd written, I became motivated to write and write and write.  I hope that you enjoy my books and that you look for my next books over the coming months.", "related": ["B00GVQOJZ4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 84.0}

Their\nfavorite places were the Brule River (they canoed the Brule every month\nof the year except December and even canoed its largest tributary from\nLake Nebagamon), the Apostle Islands of Lake Superior, and the expansive\n St. Louis River separating Minnesota from Wisconsin with its boundless\nmaze of tributaries; the wild rice harvesting grounds of the Indians\nwere their frequent sanctuaries. Fifteen years of their young lives were\n spent sailing and exploring with their home built 46-foot boat\nDursmirg.   Home based in Florida, they took up residence in Melbourne,\nMiami, Marathon, St. Petersburg, and St. Augustine.  Jane and John took\nto the road by camper van and bicycle. Canada, Mexico, the U. S., and\nEurope were some of the places they explored.  They live in Merida,\nYucatan, in an ecology concept home of their own design. Their jungle\nsanctuary gives them a place and the inspiration for writing of their\nadventures and history.", "related": [], "rank": 1052186, "title": "Brule River Forest and Lake Superior", "author": "Jane Grimsrud", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We just knew those factors would contribute to all kinds of classroom naughtiness, and so we thought we would help him gain a little maturity and self-control before we put him into a group learning environment.Fourteen years later, Hayden graduated from our homeschool having never gone to a traditional school. Along the way we added seven other children to our home, which means that for all sixteen of our homeschooling years so far, we have always had a preschooler in our home. For fifteen years I was either pregnant, postpartum, or nursing a baby.Yet, somehow we managed an education for our older children that allowed Hayden to graduate with his bachelor's degree at age 20 and for our second son to gain admittance to the university of his choice.Homeschooling works.Homeschooling successfully with little ones underfoot is entirely possible.You will be tired, sometimes frustrated, and always needing to lean on Jesus, but you can also be joyful, excited to dig in, and totally blessed. I created myPreschoolers and Peaceblog in 2006 as a place to distribute additional resources and information to home educators just like you. Since then, the site has been expanded to host more than eight hundred posts, thousands of comments, and a variety of helpful tips about an assortment of topics.

The scent of the orchard, the flavor of the peaches…and the beauty of the landscape form and enticing backdrop.

Working with the darker threads of Barrie’s bittersweet classic, Anderson weaves an enchanting tale.” (Kirkus Reviews (starred review))“The mythology of Neverland is eloquently woven into the story, and characters are reborn in fascinating ways…[and] Readers will find it hard to resist being drawn into Tiger Lily’s world, where dangers and emotions are painted several shades darker than in J.M. Barrie’s classic fantasy.” (Publishers Weekly (starred review))“Its many layers create a place of dangerous wonder. Tiger Lily has been reinvented with a complex backstory, giving her a credible source of deep strength and dark emotion.” (School Library Journal (starred review))“Serious and moving.” (Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books (starred review))“This unique retelling of PETER PAN by J.

Barrie has a literary feel, lush descriptions, and a mysterious but sympathetic main character…A sophisticated fantasy, a new spin on a classic tale.” (Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA))“In expressive, graceful language, Anderson tells the story of the fierce Tiger Lily and her thorny romance with the legendary Peter Pan. Its sensitive, passionate portrayal of familiar characters…is captivating.” (Booklist)“With this quiet and bittersweet story, readers will never again think of Peter Pan as simple animation.” (BookPage)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One of those delightfully unpretentious tales that proffers a tantalizing maelstrom of frenetic fiction, Maloney strikes an affable balance between suspense, tension and levity with a host of disparate characters that are altogether engaging. Her plot is well considered and confidently woven, rarely lingering in the detail, but when it does Maloney brings an emotive resonance to her tale that is both uncommon and beguiling. Yes, her novel might fundamentally be labelled 'chick lit' but that would be a tad disingenuous, for her style of writing certainly begets much wider appeal. A confident and undeniably accomplished debut, My Pace Or Yours definitely provides for timely escapism whilst being sure to build an enthusiastic following for author Maggie Maloney. It is strongly recommended.From BOOK VIRAL SPOTLIGHT", "related": [], "rank": 1955482, "title": "My Pace or Yours?", "author": "Maggie Maloney", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 85.0}

This book is 7 chapters that detail the life of Bill Gates from his meager start all he way up to now.What I loved most about this read is the succulent details offered in the book of his rise and how each painted the full picture of what it is Today. An example was the MITS deal. The book details clearly how Gates against all odds and despite short time frame was able to succeed and make good on his promise to MITS president. Quite inspiring.\"~Eric Paul Martin\"I always admired Bill Gates and I wanted to know more about him and this book delivers. The author leaves no stone unturned in this biography. We all have computers and most have windows and it is so interesting to read about how Gates made this all come about. I recommend reading this book. I was especially interested in the chapter about how he went from millionaire to billionaire. Pick this up today!\"~The Display Guy\"If you like biographies but don't necessarily want to fork out ten bucks for a 400 page tome then Steve Walters offers a nice alternative. His biography of Bill Gates delivers. It covers all the main topics and has fresh original insight into the elusive persona of one of the most talked about men of wealth in the past few decades. There is personal background data and more in-depth look at his rise during the Microsoft years.

Sleeper ships intent on delivering worker-bee colonists as cheap labor are under construction in Earth's orbit right now. But when corporate cost-cutting begins endangering lives and slavery becomes the next viable corporate practice managed by increasingly complex and ruthless AI overseers, a few brave have-nots will band together, first to save lives, and then to save humanity itself...While //The Displaced// is unabashedly more sentimental than other futuristic corporate sagas published recently -- like Neil Asher's //The Owner// series -- it's also more streamlined. The pacing of //The Displaced// is positively breakneck, offering little description to accompany the rapidly unfolding story...D'eith delivers engaging protagonists whose interactions feel sincere. Their struggles to maintain their idealism in the face of crippling realities -- corporate control, limited resources, and the growing danger posed by their fierce efforts to retain their individuality and personal liberties -- adds much-needed weight to what would otherwise be an elaborate cautionary tale about corporate thinking run amok.//The Corpocracy// series is already mining fertile ground in //The Displaced//; here's hoping D'eith strikes gold with the next installment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anchoring personal stories in horrendous floods and destructive hurricanes, Klein and Zellmer critique the mission of the federal government to create 'floodless floodplains,' a myopic (and ironic) quest to conquer nature that ends up producing 'unnatural' disasters. Along the way, federal taxpayers funded immense flood control projects, subsidized flood insurance, and then, provided disaster relief to those who built in the floodplains. Sometimes repeatedly.Mississippi River Tragediesuses this absurd narrative to call for comprehensive reform of flood control policy. Anyone who loves rivers will find compelling Klein and Zellmer’s pitch-perfect plea for ‘giving rivers room to flood.’” -Robert Glennon,Regents' Professor, University of Arizona\"Klein and Zellmer have provided a thoroughly engaging account of the human contributions to so-called 'natural' disasters that reads like a good mystery novel. By deftly weaving together a compelling historical narrative of the recurrent floods of the Mississippi River with legal and public policy analysis, they have produced a standard-setting contribution to the increasingly salient field of disaster law. The detailed vignettes of the heroes and rogues of the devastating River floods bring to life and deepen the impression of the book’s key lessons on natural resource management policies. Written by two of the nation’s top environmental and water law scholars, the book provides imaginative and persuasive solutions to the problems that result from policies that create incentives to aggravate rather than minimize flood risks.\"-Robert L. Glicksman,J.B. & Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of Environmental Law, George Washington University Law School\"A lyrical natural history and smart legal analysis of the Mississippi River. Like all great river guides, Christine Klein and Sandra Zellmer double as historians and entertainers as they use the Mississippi to explain America’s often-confounding water laws.Mississippi River Tragediesexposes how U.S. water law and policy create flood and other natural disasters—and offers specific solutions for the changes needed to prevent them. A must-read for anyone interested in the kinds of answers that help keep rivers free as they keep people safe from harm.\"-Cynthia Barnett,author ofBlue Revolution: Unmaking America's Water Crisis", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
