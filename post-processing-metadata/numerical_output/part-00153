These intercounty or 500 series roads are a 6,788-mile network of mostly one-lane highways. They are never the most direct way to get anywhere-but they are a pleasure to drive and a way to see New Jersey life as lived by New Jerseyans.Travel with Di Ionno as he takes us to see the state's amazing beauty-from the dizzying cliffs of the Palisades, to the blunted peaks of the Highlands and Kittatinny Ridges, to the rolling hills of Morris, Hunterdon, and Somerset counties, to the topsoil-wealthy agricultural belts of Monmouth and the southern counties, to the flat, sandy beaches of the Jersey Shore. Di Ionno calls New Jersey \"a place of infinite natural beauty, a place of intricate human patterns. A place where you can see a lot in a little time. New Jersey is a restless state for restless people. A state for wanderers to explore.\" Backroads, New Jersey is a rare chance to see it all through the eyes and experiences of a well-traveled Jerseyan.", "related": ["B00192S6U4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During this time, determined group of bankers and lawyers discovered that advising on takeovers could be lucrative for their firms. The M&A transactions that had started with the “conglomerate builders” of the late 1950s and 1960s continued to evolve as these influential figures began shaping this industry through their incredible influence and keen insights.Now, inM&A Titans, financial journalists Brett Cole offers you a rare look inside the world of mergers and acquisitions by deconstructing some of Wall Street's most important players within this field and discussing what drove them, how they won deals, lost others, and battled to overcome insurmountable odds. Through in-depth interviews and extensive research, Cole skillfully introduces you to the institutions and individuals that paved the way for modern M&A.These pioneers of M&A include the godfathers of the industry—lawyers Joe Flom and Marty Lipton—who taught the industry's leading bankers, such as Felix Rohatyn, Ira Harris, Bob Greenhill, Steve Friedman, Geoff Boisi, Joe Perella, Bruce Wasserstein, and Eric Gleacher how to strategize and advise. Also profiled is Michael Milken, whose unparalleled success in high-yield bonds fueled the takeover boom of the 1980s and the ensuing popularity of leveraged buyouts.Page by page, you'll discover what events shaped the early years of the merger industry's titans, how they got their start on Wall Street, and the battles they fought inside their firms as they pushed to have takeovers considered a business amid skepticism from colleagues. Later, as the merger business became highly profitable and won extensive press coverage, a clash of egos forced some to leave the firms they started their careers at and to establish their very own merger advisory boutiques.The business of mergers and acquisitions has been both glorified and vilified over the years. Its impact on the field of business and finance, however, is undeniable.M&A Titanstake you on a detailed tour of this dynamic industry and puts the players who built this profession in perspective.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The truth was, his pilot wasn't coming to pick him up for the return trip to Tesoro del Mar until the following morning, but after almost two weeks with Scott Delsey and his soon-to-be-wife, Eric needed some space. Spending so much time with the blissful couple and seeing how in love they were only made him more aware of what was missing from his own life.When he'd accepted the invitation to visit Scott's ranch in Texas, he'd thought his friend might want to offer him a job at DELconnex, his communications company. On more than one occasion in the past, Scott had mentioned that he could use someone with Eric's education and experience, though they both knew Eric had no intention of leaving the Tesorian navy.Now, of course, the situation had changed, and Eric was willing to consider any possibilities his friend presented. It turned out one of those possibilities was to stand up as the best man at Scott's wedding.It seemed that everywhere around him people were getting married and having babies. First it was his eldest brother, Rowan, who had been forced by tragedy and tradition to the altar. Luckily for him, he'd managed to fall in love along the way. After six years of marriage, he and Lara were happier than the day they'd exchanged their vows, even with—or maybe because of—the two active young sons who did their best to run their parents ragged.Three years after Rowan pledged \"till death do us part,\" their youngest brother, Marcus, had found a woman who inspired him to do the same. Recently, he and Jewel had welcomed their first child into the world—a beautiful baby girl who looked just like her mother and already exhibited the legendary charm of her father.Both of his brothers had lucked out, and Eric was genuinely happy for them. But the only mistress Eric had ever been committed to was the sea—and she'd tossed him aside, carelessly discarding everything he'd given her and taking away everything he was.As he drove his rented Mercedes northeast toward San Antonio, he forced himself to acknowledge the truth he'd been avoiding for too long—he wasn't just alone, he was lonely.He envied what Rowan had with Lara, what Marcus had with Jewel, what Scott had with Fiona. And he wondered why he'd never met a woman who made him think in terms of marriage and forever. Okay, having spent the better part of the last twelve years on board a ship might have something to do with it. Add to that the uncertainty of never knowing if the women he'd been with were genuinely interested in him or only attracted to his title or his uniform, and it probably wasn't surprising that he'd reached the age of thirty-six without ever having been in a long-term, committed relationship. Still, the realization wasn't going to fill his life or keep him warm in bed at night.The rumble of his stomach finally broke through his introspection and a neon sign announcing Shea's Bar & Grill snagged his attention.Despite the fact that the building was smack in the middle of nowhere, there were several vehicles—mostly dust-covered pickup trucks—in the parking lot. His empty stomach again protested his decision to leave his friend's ranch before dinner and he flicked on his indicator to make the turn.He parked his shiny rental between an ancient red pickup and a mud-splattered Jeep and sat for a moment, wondering if he would look as out of place in the bar as his vehicle did in the parking lot. A man who'd grown up in the public eye wouldn't usually worry about such things, but Eric had become more sensitive to the attention—and the speculation that surrounded him—since the accident.He pushed out of the car, slowly limped toward the entrance. The deliberate, unhurried movements helped ease the stiffness from his hip so that he was walking almost normally by the time he reached the door. His therapist had warned that he might always have the limp and the discomfort—at the time, he'd thought it was a small price to pay for being alive. When he'd had to leave the navy, he'd realized the physical scars weren't the biggest price.A sign inside the door invited him to seat himself. He bypassed several empty tables around the perimeter of the dance floor and made his way to the bar. As he slid onto a vacant stool, he forgot about his hip and everything else as he glimpsed a vision that was more impressive than anything he'd seen while sightseeing in Texas.Hermoso… espectacular…perfecto.Her hair was as dark as midnight and tumbled over her shoulders like a silky waterfall. She was wearing a deep, V-neck shirt that revealed just a hint of cleavage and was tucked into slim-fitting jeans that molded to narrow hips and long legs.His gaze skimmed upward again and locked with hers.He felt a sharp tug of attraction deep in his belly, an almost painful yearning, and he could tell by the sudden widening and darkening of eyes the color of a clear summer sky that she was experiencing the same sensation. Instantaneous, raw and powerful.But then she tossed her hair over her shoulder and smiled easily.\"Hey, handsome.\" The slow Texas drawl made him think of lazy Sunday mornings spent lounging in bed—and wasn'tthatan unexpectedly intriguing image? \"What can I get for you?\"She smiled again, and suddenly he was wanting a lot more than he'd come in for, but he forced himself to respond just as casually. \"A beer would be good.\"She grabbed a clean mug from the shelf behind her. \"Any particular kind?\"He tore his gaze from the stunning face to glance at the labels on the taps. He noted the familiar Amstel, Heineken and Beck's brands, but opted for one that he guessed would have a more local flavor. \"Lone Star.\"She tipped the glass beneath the nozzle to catch the amber-colored liquid that flowed out. \"You're a long way from home, aren't you?\"\"Am I?\"She slid the beer across the bar to him. \"Well, you don't sound like a local, and if you were, I would have seen you before now.\"He didn't think she was flirting with him exactly. But she seemed, if not interested, at least curious, and he couldn't resist testing the waters.\"You don't remember?\" he asked, his tone intended to convey both disbelief and disappointment.She made change for the ten he gave her and leaned across the bar in a way that greatly enhanced his view of her cleavage. \"If I don't remember,youobviously didn't make much of an impression.\"He grinned at her quick response and lifted his glass to his lips as she moved down the bar to serve another customer.He'd struck out with the sexy bartender, but it was his first time at bat after a long absence from the plate and, the way he figured it, it was only the top of the first inning. There was a lot of the game still to be played.Eric ordered a barbecued pork sandwich with a side of spicy fries and washed it down with another draft as he watched the woman who'd eventually introduced herself as Molly Shea check on her customers at the bar. She took a moment to chat with each one as if they were all old friends, and he knew some of them probably were.\"How long have you been a bartender?\" he asked her.She poured a glass of water and squeezed a wedge of lime into it. \"Forever.\"\"Has it always been your ambition?\"\"It's honest work,\" she said.\"I wasn't implying otherwise,\" he told her. \"You just seem like a woman who could do so much more.\"\"I can make all the fanciest drinks,\" she said, deliberately misunderstanding him. \"But we don't have much call for them here.\"\"You're determined not to give away anything about yourself, aren't you?\"\"Bartenders don't make confessions, they listen to them.\"\"I thought that was just a stereotype.\"\"I used to think so, too. But I learned quickly that a sympathetic ear and a shot of Scotch whiskey is a lot more successful at loosening tongues than a long couch and a fifty-minute clock.\"His gaze skimmed over her face. \"The ears are nice,\" he agreed. \"But I'll bet it has a lot more to do with your soft voice and warm smile.\" And the idea of this woman on a long couch—minus the fifty-minute clock—was more than a little intriguing.\"Is that why you're here?\" she asked. \"Are you looking to unburden your soul?\"\"My soul isn't burdened.\"Her only response was to raise her eyebrows.\"No more than most,\" he clarified.She smiled at that, and he felt a funny little kick in his belly. It was lust, he was certain of it. Certain that what he was feeling for this intriguing bartender couldn't be any more than that.Eric picked up his cup and frowned when he found it empty. He'd switched to coffee after his second draft, and he'd already had one refill, making him wonder just how long he'd been sitting at the bar.\"It's almost eleven,\" Molly told him, somehow anticipating his question as she brought the pot over to refill his cup again. \"Isn't there somewhere else you should be?\"\"Not anymore,\" he told her.Her eyes were unexpectedly sympathetic as she asked, \"Did she kick you out?\"\"Who?\"\"Whoever's responsible for that lost look in your eyes.\"\"No one kicked me out.\" Then he smiled at her. \"Not yet, anyway.\"She laughed. \"You've got another hour.\"*   *   *He was still there at the end of the hour.And Molly was still as conscious of his presence as she'd been from the minute he walked in the door. Conscious of his attention focused on her as she began tidying up her workspace and wiping down the counters after last call.She was flattered, of course. The man was sinfully good looking with that dark hair and those smoldering eyes, a mouth that made her think of long, slow kisses and shoulders that looked as if they could carry the weight of the world.But he didn't belong there. She'd recognized that fact even before he'd opened his mouth and started speaking in that smoothly cultured voice that spoke of private schools and a wealth of other privileges.And she wondered what he was doing in Texas or, more particularly, what he was doing in her bar.She did kn...", "related": [], "rank": 1058605, "title": "The Prince's Holiday Baby (Reigning Men Book 1942)", "author": "Brenda Harlen", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Part of the problem stems from Gunst, who undermines her own observations by supporting her narrative with myth and imagery. Rhoda, Gunst's childhood nanny and de facto mother, is undeniably loved, but, like all things black in this memoir, she is only a romantic figure. In describing Rhoda's first encounter with her future employer, Gunst's grandmother, Gunst writes, \"She remained standing, which had the advantage of giving her the edge, allowing her to be as tall and upright in her stance as in her spirit.\" In trying to capture the spirit and strength of the black women who helped rear her, Gunst pays little more than the requisite homage-\"yet only I could see who she really was: a person who happened to be a Negro, rather than a Negro who was therefore not a person\"-to the fact that black women had few options outside a life of servitude. Despite its title, Gunst's memoir isn't really about race, or family, it's about Gunst showing how she's always been different from-if not better than-the archetypal, bigoted southerners alongside whom she was raised.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

Jennings, a mechanic, signs on at Retherick Construction, agreeing to be paid richly on the condition that his memory will be wiped clean of everything he did after he completes his two years of service. When he awakes, his memory erased, he discovers that he had declined the money in favor of seven seemingly random items which he must use to avoid the Special Police, who are investigating Retherick Construction. Narrator Dullea does a fine job of evoking the story's tension as well as Jennings's puzzlement over his situation. However, he lends the story's one female character a saccharine, whispery voice that detracts from the narration. Although this audio adaptation may please fans of the movie who are interested in seeing how the original story has been altered for the silver screen, those looking for an introduction to the author's works would do better to pick up the collection on which this audio is based,Paycheck: And Other Classic Stories.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time. His use of the time-honored artifice of writing under a pseudonym comes from the necessity to still maintain a day job and the habit of employers to Google new applicants to discover what stupid things said applicant is willing to foolishly do, and then doubly foolishly post for the world to see afterwards. Such invasions of one’s personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother’s secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually “better” he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, “Writing time is always good time.” He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B007NMO0JA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While pointing out the dogmatic nature of many 'scientific' views of consciousness, he presents a cogent account of Buddhist views, showing the supporting evidence that lends itself to further empirical investigation. This is an important work that brings Buddhist views on rebirth into the modern world in a thoroughly non-dogmatic, open-minded fashion, and I recommend it to all who are interested in the nature and potentials of consciousness. --quoted on the back cover", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He touches on Germanic migrations, the Carolingian Empire, the Reformation, and the rise of absolutism; treats more elaborately the Enlightenment, revolution, and the Romantic age; and finally concentrates on the emergence of the unified Wilhelmian German Reich and its defeat in WW I, the short-lived Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, divided Germany, and the reunification of Germany and its aftermath. Without overwhelming readers with too many details, the author skillfully combines aspects of political and social history with vignettes and portraits of major intellectual figures and developments. The engaging narrative features analysis and up-to-date interpretations of the major epochs of German history. . . . Overall, Mustafa's account is judicious and informative. The short bibliographies at the end of each chapter contain suggestions for further exploration. . . . Highly recommended. General readers to graduate students.(CHOICE)A concise and lucid primer. Easily accessible to students, the book clearly explains the central issues related to the development of Germany as a cultural and national identity over the centuries. Mustafa weaves political and social history together with ease, offering a solid and informed approach to the study of German history. (Frederick C. Schneid, High Point University)Sam Mustafa's ability to present a range of complex material in an accessible manner to students is impressive. I especially appreciate his emphasis on regionalism in German history and dynamism in German nationalism, as many texts are overly teleological in their goal to arrive at the German nation state. I look forward to using this fine book in my introductory German history classes.

Author Brian Clegg clearly understands that science is only as dry as the ivy-covered professors who make it so.' -- Word Magazine 'This is science simplified, surprising and entertaining.' -- Choice Magazine 'Everything you were afraid (very afraid) to ask is explained in this brilliant guide to the science of getting into the air, staying there and landing.' -- Iain Finlayson, Saga \"Inflight Science,' by Brian Clegg, is essentially an eye-spy book for adults. After passing through the traumas and trials of security (where it is unlikely, you will be pleased to learn, to get enough of an X-ray dose to damage your DNA), and settling the kids to watch movies on their seatback screen (the LCD TV, by the way, relies on the same technology as sunglasses) this book will take you through the rest of your journey. Despite the odd alarming fact it is not, however, designed to scare one off flying. Quite the reverse: its intention is to inform - fitting into that publishing niche somewhere between hard science and Schott's Miscellany that was so successfully exploited by books such as 'The CloudSpotter's Guide.' The great strength of the book is its ability to pull out from the mundane experiences of modern air travel - the contrails and cumulonimbus, the security scanners and salted snacks - to explain a wider technical point.' -- Times '...we should be grateful for this book from Brian Clegg, an unabashed aircraft geek. Everything about aircraft seems to fascinate him: how much they weigh, how their lavatories work, how they affect our bodies. His curiosity extends to airports, which he turns into pleasure palaces full of little-known facts rather than the dull shopping malls we normally take them to be. His book is structured as a representative flight, from check-in to customs, in which at every turn he micro-analyses the technical and scientific aspects of the experience. I consider myself reasonably competent on matters aeronautical, but he still managed to surprise me with something new on every page. For example, he digresses on why there will never be electric aircraft. The reason is that to carry the same amount of energy as 10kg of jet fuel, you'd need one ton of batteries... With this book in hand, we have all we need to set off on our next flight with our eyes open to the sheer wonder of what is involved.' -- Alain de Botton, Mail on Sunday 'Clegg's foray into the science of air travel should be awarded some precious space in your hand luggage ... The beauty of the book ... lies in the way it makes you see the world afresh, learning about the way things work.' -- Erika Burrows, Engineering & Technology 'Each paragraph makes the world of science easier.' -- Statesman 'The perfect non-fiction equivalent of an airport novel.' -- Sunday Star Times 'Light but informative ... fun and accessible and the perfect book to read on your travels ... it'll leave you marvelling at the science and engineering that goes into flying.' -- Laboratory News \"Inflight Science' catches the current wave of Brian Cox-approved popular science ... for those who are interested in the way things work, and have seen the films on offer on board, it's a pleasant way of riding out the bumps.' -- Rebecca Nicholson, Sunday Times 'An engaging guide for the unscientific to every aspect of your flight.' -- Sunday Times '['Inflight Science'] is a revelation ... In short, a whole new world of flying opens up.' -- The Scientific and Medical Network 'Imagine Leonardo da Vinci seated next to you on an airplane... Brian Clegg attempts to restore something of the lost wonder of air travel ... even as Leonardo, so fascinated by science, might have done ... leav[ing] his readers improved for the journey and filled with a renewed sense of curiosity toward the wonders out their window.' -- Wall Street Journal 'If flying in an airplane has left you with questions, Clegg will have the answers you're looking for and then some.' -- Publisher's Weekly 'In other discussions of everything from jet engines to jet lag, Clegg both fascinates and informs.' -- Science News 'There's much to be learned in this book, for both young and old.' -- British Airways Business Life", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the basic settings tour Doug then gets down to the heart of this great camera: the custom settings and focus system. His explanation is first class and he explains how various custom settings are related to each other. The focus system on this camera is top drawer and Doug does a fine job explaining what can be a very intimidating area of this camera. All in all a great read.  Camera in one hand and reader in the other and dig in. I am on my third read through and still absorbing and tweaking. Thanks Doug....just what I was looking for.-Tim S.A Must-Have Accessory- What a great addition to my bag.

I look forward to learning more every time I open the book.-StevenBrilliant - just what I was looking for!A manual that was exciting, clear to follow, had examples and was used by a professional who gave just the right amount of technical info with explanations of why you use those settings, when to use those settings and so on...all properly explained. Doug's book is a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. The camera company should be employing Doug to write their cameras manuals!-Robert D. Definitely reduces the slope of the learning curve to an easy gradient- I found that it was easy to read and understand, full of important hints and suggestions and allowed me to get to grips with the tools available in the camera in a very short time indeed. Excellent value!-O.B. This book, together with the manual that came with your camera, is all you need to start discovering all the potential of this camera.-Max M.It's the first guide I've read which has taken me through all the settings in an understandable way.

Credit is then taken by the author for the seemingly random charges of chemical and electrical energy that make those thought processes possible and that have then been woven into a tapestry of verbal music that plays upon the hearts and minds of those who open their eyes to see into the world of the author's mind. Ava is no such author.  \"Take the tools you have been given and share your works with the world of men.\"  This is a motto of one who writes from the heart, one wishing to share the emotion felt, to give the reader pause to see beyond the ordinary into a world that may or may not exist in reality, but most certainly does in the heart and soul of any and all who believe there exists something greater than the frail human body.  To dream and help others dream of a world beyond their own, to share the life and love of those who might possibly reside there, to help them see that they do not journey upon the secluded path alone...that is the goal of this author.", "related": [], "rank": 3593325, "title": "The Chronicles of Heaven's War, Book I: Sisters of the Bloodwind", "author": "Ava Dohn", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reinecke and a number of family members and Board Certified Behavior Analysts offers the reader a look at some of the ways in which problem behaviors can effectively be addressed, especially when one intervenes early in the child s life. The book presents a broad array of difficult to manage behaviors, and describes creative interventions for addressing these problems. Newman and Reinecke remind the reader that without a functional analysis of a problem behavior, it is very risky to take a procedure that was effective with one person and use it with another. That caution is very wise, as the wrong intervention may serve to strengthen an inappropriate behavior. However, the take away message from the book is that there are a great many behavioral interventions that can be of benefit to children and parents alike and that the parent-professional collaboration can yield powerful results for the whole family.    Sandra L. Harris, PhD.  Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey --Back CoverHats off to Drs. Bobby Newman and Dana Reinecke, who have brought together a wonderful array of writers providing real solutions to common challenges faced by families of individuals with autism spectrum disorders! Move with a Purpose: Addressing Common Behavior Issues on the Autism Spectrum contains recommendations based on a careful assessment of underlying functions and contexts and is solidly grounded in applied behavior analysis. The chapters are presented in an upbeat and authentic manner by the very individuals involved in implementing the interventions that are described.

In this book Douglas Irwin explains why, shedding important new light on both that history and current policy.\" --Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley\"There was much less resort to protectionist measures in the Great Recession than there was in the Great Depression. Douglas Irwin carefully reviews the disastrous protectionist policies of the 1930s and shows that countries that persisted in fixed exchange rates heightened protection much more than those that abandoned a peg. He concludes that the difference in 2007-9 was in significant part because many more countries had flexible exchange rates. This is a very important finding, and the book is a must-read for all those concerned with macroeconomic, trade, and exchange rate policy.\" --Anne Krueger, Professor of International Economics, Johns Hopkins University, and Herald L. and Caroline Ritch Emeritus Professor of Sciences and Humanities, Stanford University\"Douglas Irwin's book reminds us why we should pay attention to the lessons of history. He recounts how policy constraints, combined with the orthodoxy to exert pressure on open trade relations in the 1930s, led to a fiasco that took decades to reverse. Irwin argues that the non-trade policy options available today have saved us so far from a protectionist explosion in the wake of the Great Recession. The danger of protectionism still haunts us today, and its impact could be even greater, given the role of global production chains today. This is an innovative book that helps us to understand and anticipate the policy reflexes of governments.\"-- Pascal Lamy, Director-General, World Trade Organization", "related": [], "rank": 1605064, "title": "Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s (Ohlin Lectures)", "author": "Douglas A.

After the war he turned to full-time writing of detective and adventure novels and produced more than forty-five books. His work was serialized, televised, broadcast, filmed and translated into some twenty languages. He is noted for his varied and unusual backgrounds -- which have included Russia, newspaper offices, the West Indies, ocean sailing, the Australian outback, politics, mountaineering and forestry -- and for never repeating a plot.

Maybe others could have come across what he did without living it, but, if that is so, there seems to be a value in actually doing it. His most important years were spent in San Francisco -- forty of them. The center of those years was his thirty-four years as a practicing trial lawyer, beginning April Fool's Day, 1971, and ending in January of 2005. It was on the latter date that the California State Bar placed him on \"inactive\" status. At that point, he and his wife returned to the Portland, Oregon, area, where they had attended high school. There, they took over a failing little farm and took to raising two Labrador pups. Finding farming very hard and hunting season short, he began to spend some time mulling over and writing about his practice as fiction. After all, being in San Francisco from 1965 until 2005 was like trying to enjoy a good bottle of wine and some pasta in the middle of a battlefield.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After going back to school to earn an M.S. in Accountancy and her CMA (Certified Management Accountant), she went to work for The Wiremold Company, a world-class organization and textbook case in Lean and Lean accounting. Then, after 15 years of service in operations and finance in two manufacturing conglomerates, Sue semiretired, and went back to education as an adjunct at two universities, one online and one brick-and-mortar. It was here that she realized that the behavior we see in business today is \"learned\" behavior, and that it has been learned, both by engineers and by accountants, at our universities. Sue believes Lean accounting will never become a valid, well-utilized, and respected cost management system until we begin to teach it in our accounting texts and curricula, including our MBA programs, at all universities.Since 2007, Sue has been the creator of the innovative new Lean Beans program on Lean accounting, and owner of Lean Beans LLC, an education and consulting group in Lean accounting. She has delivered her highly respected seminar, \"Lean Thinking for Accountants Sustaining Corporate Growth,\" for over three years and in 30 major U.S. cities, to assist CPAs in fulfilling their continuing education requirements in cost management. Today she spends most of her time assisting small manufacturers in their Lean accounting journey.Her new book,The Controller as Lean Leader: A Novel on Changing Behavior with a Lean Cost Management System, brings together the good, the bad, the ugly, and the humorous from all of her experiences. She presents information in a way that will change the way you think. She creates surprising and compelling visuals to change the way you feel about finance in business today. She guides readers through the first three principles of Lean, which are so crucial to the successful implementation of the Lean cost management system. Then she guides the reader to understand how only a Lean direct cost management system will drive the correct \"behavior\" to sustain a Lean change management initiative and change the culture in any organization today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of my books are based on real places and in some cases on real events, although the places and events are fictionalized.Fictional characters live only because the reader can relate to them and I do my best to make that easy. I hope you enjoy reading my books and feel free to me or use the contact information at the left if you have any comments or questions.I was born and raised in Decatur, Illinois, but moved to the Moweaqua area around 1991. I like small towns and rural settings, as does my wife of thirty-six years, Barbara. We have two grown children, John and Anna to whom I dedicated my first book, The First Suitor. Now after over thirty years of practicing law I would like to write full time, but yet I find myself full time in the law and part time in writing. I enjoy telling stories and some would say that all lawyers are born fiction writers, because fiction is all they write in the first place. I have to admit that there is some truth to that.Recently I have retired from the private practice of law and now work for the United States Department of Justice. I have now relocated to Louisville, Kentucky.I try to draw on my experiences in the practice of law and my life experiences in general to give realism to my stories and characters. In the 1970s I served in the U.S. Army as a Military Policeman and in the late '80s, I was a Captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, Army National Guard. I have been to Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and many of the United States. I like to work the settings of the places I've been and things I've done into my stories.I am foremost and always an entertainer and that is why I write fiction, but I try to make it real and believable as well as entertaining.", "related": [], "rank": 370107, "title": "The Preacher", "author": "Robert James Allison", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Joining the Sisters of Providence Community after high school exposed her to an awesome group of spiritual women who fostered creativity, spirituality and individual talents.   With the support of the Providence Sisters, Meg went on to get a BS from St. Mary-of-the-Woods College, a MaEd from Washington University and a PhD from Indiana University.  These degrees translated into a variety of professional educator experiences, including an Academic Vice-President, an Electronic Information Vice-President, a College Professor of Computer Science, Business and Education, an Education Department Chair, a High School Counselor and teacher. Conversations with students, parents, parishioners, friends and family frequently exposed the raw emotions surrounding death of a loved one.  While she was unaware she was storing these conversations, Meg found them playing a significant role in fleshing out the details of Erin Malone’s role as a conduit between the human and the spiritual world. While Meg is a new author, story-telling has been in her bones since childhood, telling nightly “Little Mama and Orville” stories to her younger sisters.  Her story telling skills lay dormant for many years until nieces and nephews were old enough to respond to new characters, like the “Inside Out People.” For years she was like a Pied Piper entertaining any young relative who would sit and listen. Many years later Wood Spirits resurrected that penchant for creating believable fiction. The story grew out of actually seeing human faces in a cabinet.  These realistic images sparked her imagination, raising questions about their origin and purpose and giving her months of creative activity.   After many years, what started as personal entertainment, resulted in Wood Spirits and became the source of many wonderful heartfelt conversations with family, friends and strangers about their personal spirit world communications.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Found running down an English motorway clad only in jeans, a blood-splattered amnesiac is admitted to a hospital where young, widowed psychiatric registrar Dr. Elizabeth Santer and her boss, Dave Watson, try to restore his memory. Named John West by the staff, the man gradually shows signs of being either a highly trained military officer or a deadly terrorist--the latter prospect being especially worrisome since a world peace conference is about to take place in London. Although British military experts believe the man to be a terrorist and want to move him to a secured military hospital, Elizabeth has her doubts about their assessment. She likes him, and she manages to jog his memory with pictures of a Welsh town after detecting an accent in his speech. But John raises the stakes significantly when he makes a run from the hospital and takes Elizabeth hostage. Unharmed, she learns that Dave and two guards have been killed. The authorities say John murdered them, but Elizabeth knows better. Hoping to reawaken more of his memories, she stays with John as he searches Wales for his identity--all the while dodging the military police. At the end of this grueling story of survival, not only is John's real identity made clear but his true involvement with the peace conference is revealed. While the rewards prove ample enough for Elizabeth, they're not likely to satisfy more discriminating readers.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jesse has studied anthropology and used her \"education\" as an excuse to hang out with vampires- her masters' thesis was going to be modern vampire culture. They really do exist. Vampires have been her obsession since she was about five years old when she swears she was bitten by one. She enjoys reading and writing.

The comical office romance and life-journey story combine for a satisfying, amusing read.Pleasantly Surprised. Elizabeth Wright: BestChickLit.comAlthough it starts off with a humorous insight into the life of a compulsive eater, it quickly moves into much deeper territory, exploring the way that our past can affect our actions and even personality. There is no clichéd makeover as the protagonist, Rowan, suddenly becomes beautiful. Instead she slowly evolves, learning to like who she is, eat cleanly and ditch her old hang-ups, losing the weight along the way. And that is, essentially what this story is about; the evolution of humans into people who can control their impulses, are accountable for their actions and entirely happy with their lives.The setting of the law firm is ideal ... Throw in a couple of gorgeous, rich and intelligent men, a tropical destination and a bucket-load of tension and you've got one gripping book.

Not so inThe Color of Power.Through the time-honored technique of closely observing one city, Douzet illuminates many conjunctions: space and demography, race and class, immigrant and native-born, coalitions and competition, winners and losers, politics and policy.The Color of Powercaptures the booming, buzzing confusion and exhilaration of American urban politics as well as we can hope for.(Jennifer Hochschild, Harvard University)Anyone who wants to understand the ramifications of the nation’s changing demography should readThe Color of Power.Frédérick Douzet traces the evolution of Oakland from its early days as a white-majority city through the rise of Black Power and the subsequent political incorporation of African Americans and then on to today’s multiracial city of the twenty-first century. Douzet provides both breadth and depth in her analysis, covering class as well as race over time and giving special attention to spatial concentrations and how they help shape the building of city coalitions.(Clarence Stone, George Washington University)", "related": [], "rank": 4211745, "title": "The Color of Power: Racial Coalitions and Political Power in Oakland (Race, Ethnicity, and Politics)", "author": "Frédérick Douzet", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jason sets off with his companions in the ship Argo to recapture the Golden Fleece, but the crew of the Argo is different, and many well-known events are missing or changed. In an interesting afterword, Evslin explains that he has chosen lesser-known details from the classical sources and omitted the familiar; he does this without violating folklore tradition. His streamlined version has emotional involvement because of the first-person narrative of bitter, sharp-witted Ekion, Argonaut and son of Hermes, who colors the account dramatically with his fascinating personality. Unfortunately, Evslin periodically shifts point of view to different characters, interrupting the flow. But there is still more immediacy than in the third-person accounts of Ian Serraillier's The Clashing Rocks (Walck, 1964; o.p.) or Padraic Colum's The Golden Fleece (Macmillan, 1983). Characterization is excellent. Lethe, an egocentric, amoral bubble-head, is truly the valley girl of nymphs, and Medea is despicable. Motivations are clear for both mortals and gods, rendering their actions logical. Evslin's language is more accessible than Colum's heroic tone or Charles Kingsley's Victorian didactism. The plot is full of seething emotions which effect deeds. The book is exciting, and the fight scenes dramatic, but there is a feeling of not being completely fleshed out, and there are a few abrupt skips in plot. Full-page black-and-white illustrations reinforce the mood of the story. Despite small flaws, this is an interesting supplement to standard reading.

Mention nyama choma (roasted goat meat) to a Kenyan, durian fruit to a Malaysian, or a churrasco completo (a huge sandwich) to a Chilean, and you've instantly got a local friend that you will be able to connect with even if you don't speak their language.The more I've traveled and eaten food from around the world, the more I've realized just how important food is to everyone.\"The Dirty\" does not imply unsanitary or unclean. It rather relates to the dining conditions where many of the tastiest restaurants are located: in transportation stations, on the side of the street, or in the alleys of the back streets. However, street food, though it may not have the best seating or conditions, the food is equally clean, if not safer to eat than food in more sit down style restaurants. Why? Because in many countries, street food is often the cheaper and more popular meal option. This means that the food is constantly being served fresh to a continual flow of demand.\"The Delicious\" is not hard to explain. One of the most exciting aspects of life is being able to enjoy meals. The diversity of ingredients, cooking styles, spices, and flavors all make each and every cuisine in the world unique and delicious. There are tasty things to sample anywhere you go and finding things that are appealing is normally not too difficult. That being said, it's important to have an open mind and to be a willing sampler when you travel. You never know what kind of mouthwatering, and sometimes bizarre, edible you'll discover!Whenever you travel, remember this one thing: local food will always be the best. Whatever country you visit, if you stick to the most popular regional foods in that particular place, it will be the safest and the most delicious food available.So let's journey through twenty different countries and explore the tantalizing variety of food that exists on this tasty planet!Mark Wiens, Migrationology.com", "related": ["B00A7HW52W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Porém, antes de tomar tamanha decisão radical, o autor cursou gastronomia vegetariana na prestigiada The Cordon Vert dentro da Sociedade Vegetariana do Reino Unido, a mais antiga do mundo. Continuou seu périplo pelo mundo e pelas muitas formas e estilos de gastronomia, realizando cursos na Le Cordon Bleu (Estados Unidos) e na Ecole Ritz Escoffier (França). Também fez cursos de cozinha indiana nos EUA e tailandesa no Brasil. Além de todos estes estudos, ainda possui certificação em Personal e Professional Coach na Sociedade Brasileira de Coaching no Brasil, e Health and Wellnes Coach Certification na Universidade Rice, Texas, EUA. Apesar de tamanha expertise e contato com amigos e chefs de várias culturas, o que mais o incentiva é levar todo esse conhecimento aos não iniciados nesse complexo meio. Como?

As the intensity of the relationship grows between the hero and heroine, their sexual relationship becomes so much more complex and meaningful--just as it would with real people.I hope you will all enjoy my trilogy as much as I have enjoyed writing it.

Liebegott has unleashed a book that’s part road novel, part portrait of a would-be artist as a young woman and part unabashed romance.\"—Josh Davis,The Rumpus\"Ali Liebegott’s books evoke a life-affirming sensation that comes from embracing the pendular. Her ability to hit the right tone is scientific, almost violent in its precision—a single word or observation, well-placed, can have a reader crying or laughing aloud.\"—Evan Karp,Bomb Magazine\"Cha-Ching!, [Liebegott's] latest novel, is one of those books that cause you to look up, blinking, realizing that you’ve read 75 pages and your coffee is cold. It’s a rush of offtrack betting, impulsive road trips, liquor-fueled make-out sessions, and the sort of low-end jobs that are invisible in most fiction but everywhere in Liebegott’s work.\"—San Francisco Magazine\"Cha-Ching!is a rush - the clatter of youth on the angry move, the rattling of dreamy gambles in crappy apartments, the desperate crash of falling for someone despite the million reasons why and the bang! bang! bang! of our tender hearts.\"—Daniel Handlerauthorof Why We Broke Up\"Cha-Ching!is so raw with need that I found myself itching that addict's itch to chase the seemingly impossible.\"—Karolina Waclawiak, deputy editor ofThe Believerand author ofHow to Get Into the Twin Palms\"An open-hearted, deeply romantic story about a fucked-up dyke, her pit bull, her search for love, her tenuous grasp on hope, a pretty girl and the literal spin of the wheel.\"—Sarah Schulman, author ofThe Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination\". . . fresh and compelling . . . the novel offers a subtle and compassionate depiction of addiction and its cycle of despair-and-hope, too.\"—Charlotte Bhskar,Zyzzyva\"Cha-Ching!is an addiction story without recourse to self-help and redemption. It’s a romance built not from exchanging vows, but traumas, drugs, and fluids. You had me at the puke on my sheets. The characters are always making something out of nothing—a dime into a jackpot, a shitty apartment into a home, a blank sky into a declaration of love. It’s gruesome. It’s hilarious. It’d make a puppet out of the hardest of hearts.\"—Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal,HTML Giant\"[Ali] Liebegott continues [her] winning streak with her third novel Cha-Ching!, tracing the life and times of compelling lead character Theo, a restless lesbian with a military hairstyle (which makes her gender-ambiguous enough to nickname herself \"sirma'amsir\") . . . There is a lot to relate to in Liebegott's cleverly addictive novel. Readers will wonder what happens next to Theo and Cary Grant. Will the love she finds be everlasting, or will her addictions get the best of her? Theo is an engaging character, and she will linger in the imagination long afterCha-Ching!'sfinal page has been turned.\"—Jim Piechota,The Bay Area Reporter\"Cha-Ching!is a rare novel, a smart page-turner which honestly delves deep into the screwed-up heart of one young working-class dyke. At a moment when novels about social outcasts and the downwardly mobile are rarely published, Liebgott has hit a home run with this tender, funny, and moving book, which examines the profound difficulties of being young and gay, and carving out a new home in an indifferent world.\"—Jeff Miller,Cult Montreal\"Liebegott . . . writes with easy-going, straightforward style and without a whiff of pretension. . . . Set in depressing casinos and grimy apartments,Cha-Ching!is a surprisingly optimistic, sweetly funny tale--and Theo is a heroine you might have more in common with than you think.\"—Shelf Awareness\"Ali Liebegott’s captivating second novelCha-Ching! [is] a realistic but tender portrait of the affectionate and relentlessly hopeful butch-dyke heroine Theo.\"—Shameless magazine\"Cha-Ching!is about being young, looking for love, trying to build a future, losing everything a few times, and praying for luck in Atlantic City. It's also a witty, engaging read that deserves to be called a must-read.\"—Gabino Iglesias,Verbicide Magazine\"In her honest, raw and, at times, tenderly humorous narrative, Liebegott leaves the reader asking the question: how much is it all really worth?\"—Elizabeth Coleman,Art Animal\"Addictive!\"—Marcie Bianco,Velvet Park\"In the game of American-life-on-the-go hopscotch, Ali Liebegott's heroine Theo just jumped a square ahead of Dean Moriarty. . . . The author's fine writing about gambling is as good as I ever read, including Dostoevski's and the Barthelme Bros. In the end, love, in whatever twisted, pallid form, a love that has little to do with sexuality, is the only answer. . . .Wonderful book.\"—Andrei Codrescu, author ofSo Recently Rent a World: New and Selected Poems\"Ali Liebegott chronicles the ups and downs of Theo’s life, which should resonate with everybody—the time in your life when you felt the need for wild abandon—also, unfortunately, the time when you couldn’t stand up for yourself very well.\"—Kathleen Hennrikus,New York Journal of Books\"Cha-Chingis a moving coming-of-age tale, funny and heartbreaking, compassionate and real. . . [a] well-paced, well-written, and well-conceived story.\"—Eleanor Bader,ReviewFix.com\"The biggest pleasure of this book, besides the companionship of the sensitive Theo, is its language.

Coming out of the closet after 4 marriages and 8 children, David found both crystal meth and an alternative bisexual lifestyle after a long interest explored through porn, and secret fascination for transsexuals or “T” girls as they are called in the gay community. Exploring both of these lifestyles eventually led him to befriend the real “boulevard girls”, Felicia, Amanda, Kelly, Monica, Monet, Bianca, and the famous Chocolate, the most exciting T-Girl of them all. Over time, a few of these new friends, with the exception of Chocolate, relieved him of his credit cards, money, valuable belongings and left him with a meth habit and a lifelong fascination with the “T” girl lifestyle. “Living my life with them was a continuous high” David recounts. To this day he considers Chocolate his BFF.  David has lived more than 9 lives in his colorful and very productive professional/personal life and has absolutely no regrets. Having recovered from 4 different bouts of cancer, and still living true to himself at 76, his most poignant advise to date is to “live every moment as if it’s your last… it just may be”.", "related": [], "rank": 1681364, "title": "Boulevard Girls", "author": "David Kaye", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They made a decision that they both had to work on their relationship, as well as themselves, if they wanted their relationship to work. For a long time now they have been enjoying the rewards that only a great relationship can bring. Their commitment to each other has overflowed to other couples who come to them for coaching and mentoring. Communication plays a vital role in their relationship and they are sure that at some points their level of communication entertained the neighbors! They are featured columnists, authors, speakers, and relationship consultants and have been inspiring other couples in their journey for over twenty-six years. For seventeen years they helped younger couples prepare for marriage. They believe in working with all couples.. William and Edrina have appeared on local TV shows, talk radio, and in a variety of print media. They also consult privately with other couples when time permits. They are regular bloggers on their Alive In Love blog site. Couples who have attended their Alive In Love Couple’s Workshop have found themselves being able to communicate better, respect each other more, and generally discovered a renewed sense of love for each other. William and Edrina also believe that a strong nation is built from strong family values. Families are the backbone of our society. What is taught in the home eventually becomes the pulse of the nation. When family units become broken and aren’t repaired, our nation, and our world neighbors, suffer as a result. They believe that couples have more responsibility to live in love, and act out of love, than they may realize. Strong family values, built upon incredible faith values, and couples who live out those values with each other, overflows that love into their children and out to the world. This world needs couples who have strong relationships.

Some of these shorts\nhave a paranormal aspect, while others are more along the lines of urban\n fiction. Still others represent a number of distinct genres. One thing\nthis collection makes obvious is that Jill Vance has a far-reaching\nimagination, and the ability to create riveting tales. I was so\nengrossed in these stories that I was surprised when I realized I was on\n the final page. I think what had me so riveted was that the great\ndiversity of stories exposed me to a number of genres I wouldn't\nordinarily read. I was pleasantly surprised to discover I stayed fully\ninvolved in each tale. Having said that, I am confident in predicting\nthat anyone who reads this book will find stories to enjoy.The Other Side of the Door is an apt title for this book. As the author\nnotes in her introductory text, \"You never know what's on the other side\n of the door until you open it. It might be pleasant, it may be a shock,\n but one thing is for sure - it will be a surprise.\" Those concise\nstatements provide an appropriate description of this book, and nothing I\n can say would add a thing to her remarks. The Other Side of the Door is\n truly a book with something for everyone. Regardless of your usual\ninterests, you will find at least one story herein touching upon that\ninterest, along with several - perhaps many - other tales you may be\nsurprised you enjoy. This book is an excellent way to \"test drive\"\ngenres that may be new to you. I highly recommend this book for\neverybody.", "related": [], "rank": 3037158, "title": "The Other Side of the Door", "author": "Jill Vance", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 30.0}

A boy, Jordan, is\nunusually precocious in childhood, both physically and mentally. In fact\n he's a kind of superboy who has to conceal his abilities to an extent\nso as not to attract unwanted attention. When his folks move to the\nBoston area he is 16, in tenth grade. There he meets a girl his age,\nTia, and it is instant love. She has dreamed of him, literally, for\nyears, and now at last they are together. But there are constraints:\nhe's not sure he should tell her that he's a vampire, and she's not\nallowed to tell him she's a witch. Both species have a mixed history\nwith normal folk, what with burnings and stakes through the hearts, so\nhave learned to keep out of the public eye. In fact their subcultures\nare none too certain that they should even interact; they don't quite\ntrust each other. That of course further complicates the idealized love\nof Jordan and Tia. But this summary hardly begins to describe the\nnuances of this novel. It sparkles with cleverness and information at\nevery point, and is an education to read. In fact there is so much\ninformation that the story line is sometimes slowed. You really get to\nknow how vampires and witches operate--it's not at all as nasty as\nignorant folklore makes it--and how they cope. This is the first of two\nor more novels, and there's clearly a larger story developing.\"--Piers Anthony", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As policy makers have sought to understand why these policies have floundered, many critics have focused on the failings of the women. In this engaging book, Judith A. Levine shifts the conversation in a fresh and original fashion. In rich, in-depth interviews, Levine presents women’s accounts of how employers harass them, caseworkers lie, and even family members often remain untrustworthy. Levine shows us that feelings of trust are a crucial social lubricant, but this lubricant is in short supply in the lives of single low-income mothers. Without trust, it is hard to get ahead.

It would be the first of many such appeals. As her\ncreator, the connection I've felt with Cassie since first meeting her inSunder the Hollow Oneshas been both\ndeep and personal. Nevertheless, for a character whose entire contribution to\nthe nearly half-million-word series occupies just eight of those words -- a\nsingle gesture -- her impact on readers continually impresses me.To me, nothing is more\ncompelling than a tale of sadness and strife told from the unique perspective\nof a young child. How might tragic events be differently depicted when seen\nthrough the prism of adolescent preoccupation and naiveté? Given the exact same\nset of circumstances, which are the forces that propel youngsters to make their\nfateful decisions, and how are they different from those which impel adults?\nThis distinction is what I have tried to highlight inVelveteen.Cassie's ideation of a world in\nwhich the recently monstrous are now considered mundane reflects her limited\nperspective and experience. The relatively new \"technology\" of Reanimates\n(zombies) as civil servants harbors an inherently destructive potential, to\nwhich her parents are sensitive, but which Cassie is only marginally aware. But\nlike the pre-rabid dog which will inevitably turn on its owner -- or perhaps\nmore aptly, a machine with the capability to be misused as an instrument of our\nannihilation -- all it takes is one mistake or individual with an agenda to\nunleash that potential. Even as her parents' fears become reality, the\nconsequences remain primarily in the background for Cassie as she struggles to\ndeal with her own issues using a belief system apropos to her age.Despite her overprotective\nmother's attempts to shield Cassie from the harsh world (admittedly for her own\nselfish reasons), the tragic irony is that she and Cassie's father unwittingly create\nan equally immediate and harmful environment in their own home through their\nsquabbling.Velveteentells the story\nof what happens when these two destructive forces begin to collide.Velveteenis a standalone novelette, but the story is very much a\npart of the dystopic world of GAMELAND. If you haven't already read the series'\nfirst season, you can get a sense of it in the includedshort\nexcerptwhere Jessie encounters Cassie shortly after entering Gameland (also viewable in the \"From the Inside Flap\" section on this page). For\nthose who might be wondering: Yes, Shinji does make an appearance inVelveteen, but only in a supporting role.\nThe focus of this story is on Cassie and, of course, her rabbit.I have also included brief\nexcerpts of two upcoming novels from the same world:Jessie's Game, a continuation of\nthe GAMELAND saga (due out fall 2013), andA Dark and Sure Descent, a bridge between the\noriginal series andVelveteen.Descenttells the story of the Long\nIsland outbreak and the role which Cassie's parents, as animal researchers at\nthe controversial Laroda Island animal research laboratory, play in it (due out\nwinter 2013).For those interested in the\nvampire rabbit story referenced inVelveteen,\nthe title isBunnicula:\nA Rabbit-Tale of Mystery,\" by Deborah and James Howe.To be notified of upcoming\nreleases such as these, please make sure to subscribe to theTanpepper Tidings, my ~monthly newsletter.\nOpting in and out is easy:tinyletter.com/SWTanpepper", "related": ["B00AI0KX18"], "rank": 530773, "title": "Velveteen", "author": "Saul Tanpepper", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rostand, spy for the Alliance, infiltrates the enemy's base of Cistern on the moon Andromeda. While scouring the base for information, Kira Chand, a prisoner on the base and one of the Alliance's best trainees escapes. Like Rostand, she is on a mission to retrieve any information about the enemy and has a disturbing intel on Hideux. A mythical demon, Biskara, turns out to be Hideux's father and the reason why Hideux is always one step ahead of Azimuth. An important discovery indeed, but both Rostand and Kira need to make a getaway from the enemy base and relay the message to their superior.The Cistern Mission: A Kin Chronicles Short Story is the prequel to Michael Dadich's The Kin Chronicles series. It is a novelette and an introduction to this series. Four first chapters of Book 1, The Silver Sphere, are also included to give potential readers - who would be excited and swayed by this prequel - some insights into the sci-fi/fantasy adventure that awaits them. Characters Malefic, Shelby Pardow, Zach Ryder and even a librarian, Walter Dempsey, are introduced to us. Prose is faultless. The action scenes are excellently written with just the right amount of suspense, excitement, and intrigue. Even though this novelette is aimed at YA readers, I think that mature sci-fi and fantasy fans will enjoy it immensely as well. I am intrigued and excited enough to follow the series and no doubt it will garner other prospective followers.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 1283229, "title": "The Cistern Mission eBook", "author": "Michael Dadich", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He then retired to work in industry for seven years before retiring for a second time.  At that point he and his wife bought a yacht and went to live in the Caribbean.  It was this experience that led to the idea for his first book ‘Jacaranda’.  There is so much history in the islands that remains forgotten.  The book and its sequel ‘The Guadeloupe Guillotine’ seek to illuminate a small corner of history that is largely ignored and at the same time provide a thrilling and exciting story for all who love the sea and sailing. Brought up on the books of C S Forester and Patrick O’Brien he was surprised that no one was writing similar stories about the modern Royal Navy, especially with so much going in in previous decades.  As he was himself a Lynx helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, he decided to start there, using his own extensive knowledge of the conflict.  ‘Sea Skimmer’ was the result; a book based on many true stories, the main one being why the Argentinian Exocet missiles failed to explode.  Directly involved in anti Exocet countermeasures and also with a grandstand seat of the final Exocet raid of the war, the book, although a novel, has an authenticity that cannot be bettered.  The next one in the series, ‘The Caspian Monster’ looks at Cold War Operations and the little known fact that 1983 was the year nuclear war almost broke out and no one realised it.  The next book in the series is about anti-submarine and anti-drug smuggling operations in the West Indies, something else he has first hand experience of. This novel is about the little known evacuation of Beirut and the hijack of a cruise liner and once again based on his own military experiences. He now lives near Plymouth in Devon, where he works as a full time writer and extraordinarily bad golfer.", "related": ["B00BLTJEK6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've also written Fifty Shades of Jezebel and the Beanstalk and The Sexperts: Fifty Grades of Shay, and The Sexperts: Girl with a Pearl Necklace.Question: Why do you use a pen name?Answer: I have a wonderful family, but they don't need to know their daughter/mother/sister/cousin/aunt writes sexy stuff like this. Though I firmly believe fantasy is healthy, and sex is nothing to be embarrassed by or ashamed of, a pen name makes things easier.Question: But I love your writing and want to read all of your other books!Answer: Thank you! I'd love for you to read my other books, too! But for the time being, I'm keeping my identity a secret.

La novela está basada en los acontecimientos ocurridos durante siglo XVI-XVII que dieron lugar a la piratería bajo la teoría elaborada por el holandés Hugo Grocio, Mare Liberum. Ya desde tiempos de Isabel I Tudor los corsarios y aventureros habían creado un imperio pirata, siendo precisamente ese movimiento el que utilizó la monarca para arrebatar a España su dominación en las Indias Occidentales. Otro movimiento destacable en la novela es el ocurrido en La Rochelle, la capital gala del protestantismo, ya que se destaca el papel del Cardenal Richelieu en su batalla contra los hugonotes. La escritora recrea la novela en escenarios reales, leyendas y sucesos históricos ocurridos durante el período en el que se desarrolla la trama. Lugares que además, ha visitado personalmente para recabar datos históricos de primeras fuentes con los que ha dado vida a su primera novela, Liberum 1580. Especial mención tiene La Rochelle y las islas que hoy forman parte del Caribe, las Islas Vírgenes que remontan su origen a la dominación española, inglesa, francesa y holandesa. Desde su temprano lanzamiento la novela, Liberum 1580, ha tenido una gran acogida en las redes sociales contando con más de diez mil seguidores por todo el mundo.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Edge is no match for her and he finds his guarded universe crumbling as he submits to the whims and fancies of this powerful woman. The story takes us through her manipulations and how she starts playing with his life, rules his world and completely possesses him to make him her property. Edge Steele finds himself powerless and giving in to her charms; he becomes a slave to her ruthless passion. The story explores various angles of human passion and sexual experience.The erotic theme in the story is provocative and that dominates the plot till the very end. Athena's emotions range from a kind of voyeurism to sexual submission to intense desire. The premises where the sexual encounters happen is really interesting. The steamy scenes, voyeurism, and the sweetly sadistic sensuality of Athena will keep readers glued to the book. The story shows a woman's desire to own and possess what she sets her eyes on, and her need to treat a man as a sex object and use him for voyeuristic purposes. The entire story is based on sexual activity which is sensual and erotic. Edge's submissive behavior and Athena's dominating character are well portrayed. The deep desperation to possess and own and the characters' obsessive desires have been clearly defined by the author.", "related": [], "rank": 957708, "title": "The Wine Club", "author": "Edge Steele", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
