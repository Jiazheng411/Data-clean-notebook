The Mysterious Island follows the adventures of a group of castaways who use their survivalist savvy to build a functional community on an uncharted island.  A hot-air balloon carrying five passengers and a dog escapes from Richmond, Va., during the American Civil War. It is blown off course and deposited near an obscure island. One of the castaways nearly dies after a skirmish with pirates; he is saved by the unexplained appearance of medicine after the pirates are unexpectedly routed. The group later discovers that their secret helper is the reclusive Captain Nemo (first introduced in Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), who dies and is buried at sea in his submarine. The castaways are eventually saved by a passing ship.  --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 108, "rating_average": 4.2963, "rating_total": 464.0}

Medical statistics is known to be challenging and not to mention dull. This book was designed to provide the knowledge of statistics for a wide range of healthcare professionals from medical students to doctors sitting their postgraduate exams. This book helps medical students understand the basic concepts of medical statistics starting in a \"step-by-step approach\". The authors have designed the book assuming that the reader has no prior knowledge. It focuses on the most common statistical concepts that are likely to be faced in medical literature. All chapters are concise and simple to understand. Each chapter starts with an introduction which consists of \"how important\" that particular statistical concept is, using a \"star\" system. A \"thumbs-up\" system shows how easy the statistical concept is to understand. Both these systems indicate time-efficient learning allowing yourself to focus on areas you find most difficult. Following this, there are worked out examples with exam-tips at the end of some chapters. The last chapter \"Statistics at Work\" shows how medical statistics is put into practice using worked out examples from renowned journals. This helps in assessing the reader's own knowledge and gives them confidence in analysis of statistics of a journal. In conclusion, we would recommend this book as an introduction into medical statistics before plunging into the deep \"statistical\" waters! It gives confidence to the reader in taking up the challenge of understanding statistics and [being] able to apply knowledge in analysing medical literature. To be honest, medical statistics is not a common book that a medical student will pick up, but if one has keen interest he/she will find it interesting and engaging as it is a simple read -- Stefanie Zhao Lin Lip & Louise Murchison Scottish Medical Journal 20100621 I don't own a copy of the original edition of this book; in fact I've not even seen a copy so I am unable to comment on how much better or worse this edition is in comparison. What I can comment on, however, is how utterly grief stricken I am having realised half way through life that such a book exists! It verges on being the Holy Grail for Idiots! If ever there was a book that completely lived up to its title, this is it. The first three pages are devoted to explaining how to even use the book (not many things are made that easy), and the next couple explain the design of the book. I almost feel that I should merely compile a list of excellent features this book exhibits but space would clearly not allow so I'll concentrate on a select, but by no means exhaustive few. There are eight sections divided into a total of 24 chapters (unfortunately none of these are numbered - a minor drawback), each of which tackles a particular aspect of statistics or statistical test. The first chapter, for example, looks at percentages and this is then followed by chapters on Mean, Mode and Median and so the book goes on, passing through p values, t tests, regression, odds ratio, survival analysis, etc, etc. Everything is covered. Perhaps above everything, it is the chapter layout and design that makes this book stand out head and shoulders above the crowd. At the beginning of each chapter two questions are posed - how important is the subject in question and how difficult is it to understand. The first is answered on the basis of how often the subject is mentioned / used in papers published in mainstream medical journals. A star rating is then given from one to five with five stars implying use in the majority of papers published. The second question is answered by means of a 'thumbs up' grading system. The more thumbs, the easier the concept is to understand (maximum of five). This, of course, provides a route into statistics for even the most idle of uneducated individuals! Five stars and five thumbs must surely indicate time-efficient learning! Chapters then continue to follow a uniform format with short paragraphs explaining what each particular aspect means and when it is used. Common pitfalls are also explained and highlighted boxed examples are given in each case. At the end of each chapter exam tips (light bulb icon!) are given - I doubt anyone could ask for more! The whole way in which the authors have written this book is commendable; the chapters are succinct,easy to follow and a pleasure to read. Even the total lack of colour doesn't seem to detract from the excellence of this book, it really is brilliant and the glossary at the back of the book must surely be capable of ensuring a couple of extra marks in the FRCS (Urol) written paper. Is it value for money - a definite yes even at twice the price. Of course I never exaggerate but if you breathe, you should own this book! -- Ian Pearce Urology News 20100615", "related": ["B000WLKJ08"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Its conclusions challenge many leading theories of ethics' claims regarding necessary and sufficient cognitive capabilities for moral reasoning. In practical terms, it challenges assumptions about the appropriateness of some parental decision making and research in relation to autism.\" —Ronald M. Green, author of Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice(Ronald M.

Why this is a true ethical problem is only one of many insights to be gained from Deborah R. Barnbaum's meticulous analysis. Along the way, we confront perhaps the greatest challenge—what would it actually be like for us to get inside the heads of persons with autism, and experience life as they do?\" —Howard Brody, MD, PhD, Director, Institute for the Medical Humanities, University of Texas Medical Branch, and author of The Future of Bioethics(Howard Brody, MD, PhD, Director, Institute for the Medical Humanities, University of Texas Medical Branch, and author of The Future of Bioethics )\"[The Ethics of Autism] provides a serious examination of the moral and ethical issues surrounding autism and Asperger's syndrome.

How do you get a girl into bed? Try \"pushing her onto the sheets while she's making the bed.\" What's the polite way to kick out a hooker? Give her $100 for the cab ride. Etc.

When he discovers the body of his boss's wife while cutting hay, fear motivates him to dispose of the corpse, even though he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Recognizing her son's unease and guessing its cause, Mama Lou manipulates the situation to force Roper to take responsibility for himself and his family. Daugharty (Earl in the Yellow Shirt, LJ 5/15/97) has done a masterly job of mixing bravado, indifference, paranoia, and panic into Roper's character. In addition, she delicately stirs in hints of the early Civil Rights Movement, memories of Freedom Riders, and a healthy serving of fantasy to round out her too-easily-resolved story. A reader may finish this book wishing that Daugharty had captured the essence of the Southern black experience as well as she has created the multifaceted character of Roper.

Strelecky, an M.B.A. and inspirational speaker, gives some of these questions a fresh turn and brings the reader on a quick journey into self-exploration. Through a fictional account, he tells the story of John, who sets out on a vacation to escape from his unfulfilling life. But after a forced detour, he finds himself lost and his car very low on gas as darkness falls. Beginning to despair, John sees the lights of the Why Café in the near distance and heads in that direction. Despite its appearance, this isn't your typical cafe; it's one where the menu poses questions like \"Why are you here?\" Before long, John is facing up to what he needs to do to find his way to the life he really wants. This is a simple read but asks profound questions about the purpose of life and our role as individuals. While it often seems that John is overly obtuse, his questioning helps to draw the story out and offers a richer picture of the options available to anyone looking for more meaning in life.(June 1)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Depending on helicopters for insertion and extraction, usually employed in teams only a half-dozen strong, the Vietnam-era rangers specialized in intelligence collecting and small-scale raids. Their improvised role was the product of a war without stable fronts and terrain that defied conventional means of information gathering. Stanton describes the rangers' history company by company and discusses their use and misuse by generals often as bewildered by the war as were the men they led. The book is particularly useful as a background for the large number of memoirs by veterans of long-range reconnaissance units. Not every fire fight was a victory, not every ranger a hero, but in Stanton the men in black berets have a worthy chronicler.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Using his experience as a U.S. Naval officer, and his extensive experience in the aerospace industry, he began his first novel in 1976 with a story about an attempt by North Korean special forces to hijack a U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. Fifteen years later Raid On Truman was published in hardbound and paperback and was translated into Japanese for hardbound and paperback sales in Japan. That was the fulfillment of a dream to become a published novelist. He sold a second novel on the heels of the first. COBRA DANE was published in paperback in 1995. A third novel, Sub Zero, quickly followed and was published in 1996 along with publication in Japan. John has written four more novels, Vauclain’s Shield, Hidden Sun, These Final Hours, and The Telekinetic Man and a screenplay derived from The Telekinetic Man and is in the process of trying to sell them.  Another book was published in 2003 just before the Iraqi War. Desert War was a nonfiction look at how the war might be conducted, weapons systems, intelligence gathering, and forces on both sides. While John was the author, his daughter, Christine researched the work.  Influenced initially by the works of Ian Fleming and his brand of no-holds-barred action and intrigue, John has tried to bring to readers that same action elements, but with a large dose of sobering reality. Violence has profound consequences and the characters within John's novels feel all the passion and agony of real people. Raid On Truman, COBRA DANE, Sub Zero, Vauclain's Shield, These Final Hours, The Telekinetic Man, and Hidden Sun are available on Amazon's Kindle Store. Note that COBRA DANE has for its cover image a picture of the actual COBRA DANE radar on the island of Shemya in the Aleutians. Vauclain's Shield's cover image has a photo of actual reentry vehicles passing through the atmosphere over Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and Raid On Truman has a real picture of the USS Harry Truman taken by the author.         A collection of fourteen sci-fi/horror/paranormal short stories, A Case of the Vapors was added to the Kindle store in August 2013.

Tuttle’s quick wit, unprecedented use of words and fertile imagination all serve him well in crafting works of singular interest. Writer Tuttle sets lusty, creditable characters against a backdrop of spectacle, resonance and redolence. Tuttle’s characters are all beset with the foibles of us all. They experience happiness, disappointment, defeat and victory with much the same behavior as any of us might. And, that is exactly what makes Tuttle’s books a joy to read. Whether human, unicorn, bird and evil mage we can identify with the character and the emotion felt.Filled with the fast-paced action, industrious behavior and thoughtful dialogue typifying each of Tuttle’s worksUnicorn’s OpalBook 2 Sword of Heaven series does not disappoint. The reader is carried along on an exciting ride from the opening lines as the young adventurers awaken to a lovely sunrise. Told in twenty six chapters the excitement continues right on into the battles, escapades and at last the finding of the opal.I found this to be one of the best of Writer Tuttle’s works to date.", "related": ["B006QOKIQA"], "rank": 798689, "title": "Unicorns' Opal (Sword of Heavens #2)", "author": "Richard S.

After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day.

Edgar. As an infant he was adopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, before transferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa.In 1898, he published a collection of poems called 'The Mission that Failed', and subsequently left the army to become correspondent for Reuters. South African war correspondent for 'The Daily Mail' followed and his articles were later published as 'Unofficial Dispatches'. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentials. He then edited the 'Rand Daily Mail', but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market.Returning to England, Wallace at first reported on crimes and hanging trials, before becoming editor of 'The Evening News'. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing 'Smithy', a collection of soldier stories, and 'The Four Just Men'. The latter was published with the ending removed as an advertising stunt and he offered $500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallace also worked as a journalist on 'The Standard', 'The Star', 'The Week-End Racing Supplement' and 'The Story Journal'.In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln's Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his 'Sanders of the River' books. In 1923, he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidate for Blackpool.Wallace's first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King.Along with countless articles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories, Wallace wrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920's one of Wallace's many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by 'The Bible'.He died in 1932 whilst working on the screenplay for 'King Kong', having moved to Hollywood after being offered a contract by RKO.", "related": ["B00J8P6S5Y"], "rank": 28262, "title": "The Man Who Knew", "author": "Edgar Wallace", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He contributed to various periodicals, writing first essays and later fiction. His first novel was Treasure Island in 1883, intended for his stepson, who collaborated with Stevenson on two later novels. Some of Stevenson's subsequent novels are insubstantial popular romances, but others possess a deepening psychological intensity. He also wrote a handful of plays in collaboration with W.E. Henley. In 1888, he left England for his health, and never returned, eventually settling in Samoa after travelling in the Pacific islands. His time here was one of relatively good health and considerable writing, as well as of deepening concern for the Polynesian islanders under European exploitation, expressed in fictional and factual writing from his final years, some of which was so contrary to contemporary culture that a full text remained unavailable until well after Stevenson's death. R. L.

Tim Tosta has written this kind of book.  His writings offer a way for the dying individual to remain in the present while embracing death in a way which is both humbling and inspiring.  Furthermore, Tim encourages the Witness to create their own roadmap for the privilege of accompanying their loved one into such a passage.  As a psychologist, I would heartily recommend this sensitively written, compassionate and thought-inspiring book to both patients and professionals as well as anyone interested in facing death with integrity, comfort and an affirmation for life. To use the author's words, \"The only thing that lasts forever is love\".  Simply, those words offer profound encouragement to those experiencing the loss of a loved one and similarly it gives the dying individual assurance that their essence will be both remembered and cherished. --Meyers, Susan - Psychologist and Family TherapistFor anyone dealing with confronting or embracing the realities of death and dying, once again Tim Tosta finds that sacred space where most of us struggle with our emotions, our words and our spirit.  #DEATH tweet Book02 allows us to stand amidst these difficult times not driven by fear and anxiety, but wholeness and care.  Everyone will face death in life and for those who appreciate the wisdom that can be found in 140 characters, this book is a must.  --Reyes-Chow, Bruce, Reverend - Pastor, Mission Bay Community Church, San Francisco", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was there that his cartooning hobby flowered and drew the attention of his peers - which resulted in the appearance of a nameless little monk in college flyers and posters.  In 1942, he dubbed this cheery, pint-sized creation, \"Brother Juniper.\" McCarthy was a member of the Secular Franciscan Order for seventy-one years.  He served as art director of the national Franciscan magazine, Friar.  He also taught classes about the art of comics and humor at numerous universities and colleges; and networked with fellow comic artists by playing street football out in front of New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.  Rumor has it that, at eighty-four, he could still punt a football forty yards. Father McCarthy retired to southern Florida with his wife Lilly and continued to create new material for the well-traveled Brother Juniper.  In a 2004 interview he is quoted as saying: I hope that my 'little sunbeam in burlap' will serve as an exemplar of Catholic good humor while providing us with a chuckle a week.", "related": [], "rank": 1888413, "title": "Brother Juniper at Work and Play - Empty-Grave Extended Edition", "author": "Father Justin McCarthy", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But under the leadership of young hunter Tagart, the many nomadic tribes join together to defend themselves. In the end, both are defeated, for the reinforcements, under orders from their Home Lord, capture Gehan's stronghold while they virtually destroy the tribal forces. All the principals are left alive to fight on; it is doubtful, however, that this well-researched, well-written but darkly dour book will inspire any calls for such a sequel.

Bo meets Moonbird at Ghost Flower Lodge, a psychiatric rehabilitation facility run by the Neji Indians in the desert mountains of Southern California. The boy is there with his father, Mort Wagman, a single parent, aspiring comic and schizophrenic who had recently gone off his medications. Bo (seen last in Turtle Baby) is there climbing out of a deep depression that had been precipitated by the death of her 17-year-old dog.When Mort is shot to death in a nearby canyon, Bo is devastated, but her sympathy for the boy and her job as a social worker for the San Diego Child Protective Services give her impetus to investigate Mort's death and watch over his son, who will be moved into the child welfare system if no relatives are found. Bo, whose illness gives her an acute, reliable self-awareness, has become more forceful and credible with each of her four appearances. Padgett places her in a complex, well-orchestrated plot here, involving the greedy aspirations of a medical management corporation that hopes to franchise the Lodge's traditional Neji healing approach. Firmly rooted in Bo's unique interaction with the world, the narrative develops texture and depth as Padgett weaves strands of neurophysiological research, Indian ritual, murder, big business, WW II atrocities, family ties and romance (in the continuing relationship of Bo and pediatrician Andrew LaMarche) into a gripping novel.

He gained favor with Sweden’s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII’s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Longinus Flavius Libertus, a pavement maker with a gift for solving mysteries, returns one day from an errand to his mosaic workshop in Glevum (modern-day Gloucester) to find Lucius, a poor pie seller, lying face down on a heap of tiles, strangled to death. The absence of the dead man's purse suggests that bandits may have murdered the pie seller, who was dressed in a new tunic that could have conveyed a misleading idea of prosperity. An elderly slave, Glypto, overhears a conversation at about the fatal hour between two people, one of whom Glypto can only describe as a green man, giving Libertus another avenue to pursue. The detailed picture of life in Glevum, rather than the puzzle, is the book's major attraction.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When news of her capture and subsequent relationship with the half-breed reaches polite society, her reputation and engagement (to Cain's white half-brother, as it turns out) are ruined. The young lovers decide to wed and soon realize that they have become pawns in a power struggle between two railroad magnates. Adding to the confusion, Roxanna/Alexa finds herself caught between the passions of the two brothers.

Prior to her work with Wells-Smith Partners, she was a human resources director and consultant for more than 20 years, using the Enneagram extensively as a system for evaluating employees for proper placement through personality testing and evaluation (similar to the popular Myers-Briggs System). In those positions, she helped over 500 employees at a large retail chain. As evidenced, her vast knowledge of the science of personality combined with proven spiritual practices not only helped her achieve transformative results in her own life, but they have enabled her to help others as well through the written word. For the last decade she has been sharing her lessons by writing articles, reports and books on incorporating these practices into people's lifestyles to create a \"happiness mindset.\" Some of her books include \"I Want to Be Happier Right Now!\", \"Spiritual Practices for Happiness\" and \"How to Have a Happier Home.\" She is also the author of YourEmployeeHandbook.com, which provides employee policy manuals for small businesses in six industry categories. Today, Jackie has been free from depression and at peace for more than 20 years. In her spare time, Jackie enjoys reading, spending time outside with lawn work, and being with her family and six cats.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She's even more surprised to discover that her late, abrasive uncle willed to her a plot of land subject to a sales agreement from which she stands to benefit richly. Uncle Bud's \"accidental\" death echoes that of another landowner eight years earlier, a woman whose death prompted an investigation of Janet's more beloved uncle Paul. Janet is gradually pulled into a mystery that centers on the property she's inherited, for which she feels a responsibility as its steward. Her ecologically principled curiosity places her in ever-growing danger, while the determined killer, perhaps an obvious suspect to the reader, eludes her amateur sleuthing until the moment of confrontation. An unlikely murder scheme (collapsing a bridge to kill someone?) lends interest to a predictable plot.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Howard is hired by an alcoholic woman to find out if the body of a young woman recently found in a burned-out home is that of her daughter who had run away three years earlier. Determining that the victim was indeed her client's daughter, the PI also learns that the young woman, who had been living on the streets in Berkeley, had had a young daughter. The client seems uninterested in her grandchild, but the PI feels compelled to search for the little girl. As Christmas approaches, Howard mingles uneasily with the homeless in the cold damp East Bay winter, moving from street markets to a backstage tour of Oakland's historic Paramount Theater as she tracks the murder victim's associations with high-school friends, some kindly \"old hippie\" benefactors and an enigmatic drug dealer. On the way to the satisfying solution, characters trade observations on homelessness, HIV infection and race relations, yet Dawson offers no glib answers in this timely, gentle tale.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0054TSKUE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was trying to paint a picture of the perfect hero. This made me think, do I actually know any heroes? I know some people that have served in the army, but I wanted something I had firsthand experience with. Then it hit me. I know a hero. This was someone that threw themselves into harm's way when I was only six years old. Her evil opponent was bigger, stronger and nastier. It was a big black muscular dog. It was a dog that had attacked children before. I was walking home with my dad and my Lakeland terrier, Katie, when this dog charged out of its front door and went for me. People who have dogs know when a dog is posturing or appearing big because it is scared. This dog was out to kill. Its target was a little blonde haired, blue eyed, six year old boy. All I remember was a blur of motion, a squeal and Katie hanging from this things ear as it tried to shake her off. I also remember the look in her eyes. \"I am going to die.\" Nevertheless, Katie was my hero. She was frightened, scared and out matched, she could have easily run away, but she fought for me and I believe had she not been there that day something very bad could have happened to me. This made me think. Who would actually do that? Who would put themselves in danger to protect someone that is important to them? Katie has sadly passed away after living to the grand age of eighteen years old, but I have a million and one memories of my amazing, brave and faithful dog. There have been so many occasions where she has stood by me when I was growing up and I was scared, but then many of my animals have done amazing things too.I wrote The Legend of the Hermit Master to keep my memory of Katie alive, but also share some of the excellent adventures that we both went on.

While she does offer basic directions and phone numbers, she's more interested in exploring and enjoying free and inexpensive pleasures. Each chapter focuses on a place that holds some mystery and fascination for Husher. She takes the reader to a cemetery in Barre, where graves are decorated with \"a whimsicality you don't normally associate with burial,\" offering a unique history of those interred there. Another chapter describes the breakdown and rebuilding of her Vermont hometown, Randolph, after a number of fires gutted the downtown area. Husher visits a series of concrete sculptures along Interstate 89 and follows with a thoughtful essay on the intention and effectiveness of public art. Throughout, she includes little-known historical digressions, such as one about the Fenian Raids, which occurred between 1866 and 1870, when a group of Irish soldiers attempted to invade Canada from Vermont and establish an Irish republic. \"It's fun to know a few things, however sloppily the knowledge is acquired,\" writes Husher, encouraging travelers to pick up bits of information along the wayAand her tour is bound to stir up curiosity not only about Vermont but also about all the places lost in the daze of hotels and gift shops.

I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.​", "related": ["B004XEKGP8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 38.0}

As millions of students on campuses across the country read and talked about his books, little did they know, their hero was well past thirty.Bob started writing early in life. As a high school student in Massachusetts in the 1930s, he wrote articles for, as well as helped print and distribute, a small local magazine entitled Boy's Pal. He graduated from Bates College with a multi-discipline degree in English, Psychology and Philosophy and later obtained an MBA from Harvard. His life has been an eventful one.

However, after years of mail-order sales through a small publisher in California, Rimmer's The Harrad Experiment was published by Bantam in 1967 and was finally available to a wide audience.

Now in his eighties, Bob Rimmer, always in the vanguard in his advocacy of alternatives to the traditional monogamous relationship, becomes one of the first authors to recognize the potential of the Internet to bring his books to millions of new readers.

Her heritage shows from head to toe -- in her tough, work-worn hands, and in the easy, flowing cadence of her mountain voice. Always curious, she wants to know everyone's story and has a knack of getting it -- from the old timers of her childhood to all the other people she has come across since -- from laborers to affluent developers. One cannot encounter Peggy without sharing stories. Many of her stories have roots in her own experiences:  Her dad grew beans and raised livestock. Her mother worked at a local factory to supplement the farming income. Relatives, extended family, and church provided a unique atmosphere for living and learning the old mountain traditions. She married at seventeen, finished high school, and started a family. She furthered her education at Appalachian State, but the responsibilities of six children quickly made formal study impossible. She did manage to write a few manuscripts on an old portable typewriter. Her husband teased about her spelling and sentence structure, causing her to become somewhat disillusioned with writing. She turned to crafts to assist in the struggle for survival, marketed her crafts through Blue Ridge Hearthside Crafts Cooperative, and became a board member for the organization. Moving to her own farm, she continued to raise her own food, adding a milk cow and other livestock. Tobacco was the main cash crop. Christmas trees were planted to assist the children through college. Being active in agriculture, Peggy became a board member of Farm Bureau Insurance, the local Christmas Tree Association, NC Agricultural Extension Advisory Council, and NC State University. These positions enabled her to experience some of the life beyond the mountains. For more than thirty years, Peggy assisted her husband -- a land surveyor-- with the field and office work. Through contacts made with a developer client, she started selling her Christmas trees on a lot in Naples, Florida, becoming known there as the \"The Christmas Tree Lady\". The survey business gave Peggy additional insight on the impacts -- good and bad -- to the community as the mountains became a tourist and second home destination. As the children grew up, went to college, married and had families of their own, there became time for writing. Wanting to know if she was good enough to write seriously, she attended many classes and joined a local writers group. During a luncheon, Terry Kay told her \"All words are the same. It's how you use them that makes the difference\". He also advised her to write something that wasn't personal. Her first (2003) published novel, Heaven-High and Hell-deep, resonates with Peggy's unique strong voice and storytelling ability. Always resourceful, Peggy decided she would not only write books, but she'd make and market them herself. Consequently, every book is uniquely hers: she writes the stories, paints the cover picture, then prints and binds each one at her farm.  Whether from her experiences, shared stories, or from the spirits of the past; characters keep evolving in Peggy's imagination. Then they nag her until she relates their story. Often she is working on seven or eight novels simultaneously, completing one for the character that becomes the most persistent. They just have to deal with Peggy casting their stories in her beloved mountains.", "related": ["B00BRM7QCU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It then presents the navigation problem and develops the X-ray pulsar signal models, formulating and analyzing the pulse delay estimation problem through these models. It proposes different pulse delay estimators and, using these estimators, provides a recursive algorithm to obtain the navigation solution. Closing with suggestions for future work in the field, this monograph is aimed at students, researchers and industry practitioners involved with new space navigation techniques.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She enjoys a fulfilling and enriching life that includes writing books, drawing, painting, listening to music, cooking, and spending time with friends. Tiana Laveen is a uniquely creative and innovative author whose romance fiction is geared towards those who not only want to temporarily escape from the daily routines of life, but also delve into social taboo as it pertains to interracial relationships. She creates a painting with words as her readers are guided through the lives of each and every character.Her first book series entitled Cross Climax tackles interracial dating, sex, and marriage head on without any false bravado. \"Cross Climax I\" and \"Cross Climax II\" allow the reader to dive headfirst into short stories that are packed with seduction, romance, and heart-pounding punch. The two novels in conjunction lead to a surprising, but fulfilling conclusion.Her third novel, \"The Slave Master's Son,\" transports readers back to a time and place where interracial relationships were not accepted by the dominant society. The novel delivers a scintillating, historical account of one family's struggles to deal with love, lust, and consequences.Her fourth novel, \"The Naughty Sins of a Saint,\" tells the story of Dr. Saint Aknaten, a sex therapist and public speaker who preaches his controversial philosophy - that all non-Black men should pursue Black women. Along the way he finally meets his \"queen.\" All is good until those threatened by his ideologies take action to permanently stop him. Saint must confront both personal secrets and his nemeses if he is ever to live peacefully.If you wish to contact Tiana Laveen, please contact her at facebook.com/tianalaveen.", "related": ["B00FQRW2FS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.2857, "rating_total": 23.0}

Children reading the Depression-era series about Kit from the American Girls collection will welcome books 4 and 5. InHappy Birthday, Kit has mixed feelings when Aunt Millie comes to live with her family. On the one hand, she enjoys Aunt Millie's affectionate, cheerful manner and thrifty ideas. On the other hand, Kit is sometimes embarrassed by her elder's lack of concern for appearances. InSaves the Day, readers get a glimpse of the darker side of Depression life. When a young hobo befriends Kit's family, she forms a romanticized view of life in a hobo camp. Kit revises her opinion when she visits the camp, hops a freight train on a dare, and ends up in jail. Appealing color illustrations help establish the period, which is considered in greater detail in the appended \"Looking Back\" section of social history. Two entertaining entries in a popular series.Carolyn PhelanCopyright © American Library Association.

Well, mostly Supe, illustrated by Smith to be roughly the size of a house, as he uses his superbreath to damp fires and superstrength to pull Jimmy from the rubble. Best of all is when the “caped clod” (as the Toyman calls him) corners the villain in his lair, only to be attacked by “a platoon of perilous playthings.” The book begins with a page of introductions to make things crystal clear, and there is never any doubting character motives or action choreography. This is good, old-fashioned, rock ’em, sock ’em fun, complete with your classic one-liners from Supe: “Playtime is over!” No doubt this will prep readers for longer, more serious comics.

At age five, Nick sees his father hanged as a thief; his mother is reduced to taking in laundry, and the intelligent boy becomes a scholarship student at the King's School in Canterbury. But his headmaster deems the wild, angry teenager unsuitable for higher education and apprentices him to a wheelwright. After stabbing his brutal master in self-defense, Nick runs away to London. Playwright Kit Morley (aka Christopher Marlowe) seduces the impressionable youth and places him with actor/manager John Heminges, whose beautiful wife Rebecca prompts Nick's first heterosexual longings. Torn and confused, Nick feels he must avenge Morley's murder; yet he feels loyal to sympathetic Will Shagspere (Cowell uses the variant 16th-century spelling), who comforts him; and to Heminges, who offers him trust and affection. Overriding all is his own wish to be a priest and a physician. Struggling to master his uncertainties, he follows Lord Essex to the disastrous Irish war. Later, shaken by the experience, Nick returns to London and the theater company, marries and becomes a successful leading actor. Never wholly satisfied, he finally breaks free to study theology and medicine. The golden age of English theater comes to life in Cowell's vigorous prose, as does her turbulent, conflicted protagonist.

Yet the authors have succeeded magnificently in all these areas, and this is now the definitive work for students, academics and practitioners alike.' -Stephen Hill, Professor of Sociology, London School of Economics and Political Science`Chapter One gives very significant statistics on trends towards internationalization which any researcher, practitioner or lecturer would find useful when making factual statements.... I found Chapters Two and Three particularly interesting. They present an organizational analysis of the MNC, distinguishing it from domestic companies along a number of dimensions: multiculturalism, geographic dispersion and complexity....the book is a timely arrival on the HRM scene. I would certainly recommend it to MBA students, practitioners and all who deal with international personnel. For the breadth of issues covered, it is very reasonably priced at 16.95. The editors set themselves the task of facilitating the development of appropriate problem solving strategies in the readership where international HRM issues are concerned. This they achieve to the extent that the book provides a good coverage of relevant issues'-The Occupational Psychologist`This volume offers a very thorough and well-organized contrast and comparison of human resource management at the international level.... a gold mine of organized information for international instructors and students.... Highly recommended' -Choice`Takes a truly international perspective on human resource management' -Employee Relations`It is well thought out and might very well become a milestone; one of those books that shape the teaching and research agenda of the field' -Comparative Industrial Relations Newsletter`Due to the careful selection, balancing, and organization of HRM-related topics, due to the extension of the argumentation beyond often-discussed problems and solutions related to the expatriation of (non)managers, and due to an integrated treatment of environment-, strategy-, structure-, human resources- and industrial relations-related matters there can be no doubt that the editors have made available a highly suitable introduction to the study of IHRM problems which can be interesting both for professors (in their role as academic teachers), students, and practitioners. Furthermore, it has to be emphasized that - in spite of the comparatively large number of authors - the book is much more than a simple collection of isolated papers. Quite the reverse - all of the chapters are edited carefully so that they fit into a holistic concept which is aligned with the general challenges of IHRM as they are relevant nowadays and as they are described above.... I cannot but recommend it very highly indeed to its audience' -Management International Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After he graduated high school in 2010 Corey moved to Tucson, Arizona from Fresno, California where he was born and raised. He and his parents stayed there for a year and a half where Corey attended city college for a year. A turn of life events caused them to move once again in December of 2011 to Novi, Michigan. The Parsley's only spent half a year there as Corey's mother fell ill and passed away in May of 2012. He and his father choose to start over and move back to California. All the while Corey continuously worked on his book with a new found passion for the written word. Five long years went into writing his book, Diamond and it is the first book of a four book series that he plans on writing and publishing. He also enjoys writing poetry and short fiction on a regular basis. Corey is 21 years-old and still resides in California with his father, has continued his college career, and has a constant passion for writing and for God.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some of them are widely available elsewhere, such as \"Race with Buffalo\" (Paul Goble's The Great Race [Bradbury, 1985]), \"Coyote and the Rock\" (in Judy Sierra and Robert Kaminski's Twice Upon a Time [H.W. Wilson, 1989]), and \"Possum's Beautiful Tail\" (in James E. Connolly's Why the Possum's Tail Is Bare [Stemmer, 1992]). The selections reflect choices well suited in tone and plot for the intended audience. The book concludes with detailed research notes.

Although Cheshire has its history and pretty rural surroundings aplenty, Wales is far more extreme in both aspects. The castles and the rugged hillsides scattered with stone settlements, Druid's circles and Roman roads bring out the historical muse in me. To think that I am treading the same path as someone who lived in the Iron Age, is both fascinating and humbling. Snowdonia kick-started my stalled obsession with writing in a very positive way.All this whimsical talk of the past makes me sound as if I write historical based fiction. Far from it. Much as I admire many other genres I tend to be very much rooted in current times and my work reflects a lot of my own life experiences. But this is where I find the two ideas merge a little because I am most certainly inspired by this Ice Age landscape and the idea that what has gone before, shapes what we see today, but does it shape what we feel, too?I write contemporary fiction set in North Wales. It falls very loosely into the romantic genre but it isn't hearts and flowers fiction. You may find the odd spot of arson, adultery and manslaughter laced with black humour and of course, the big landscapes of Snowdonia.", "related": ["B00ENU02BU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.3571, "rating_total": 61.0}

Recent graduates will benefit from the theory regarding wound healing and complications and the many different methods of wound closure. The more advanced surgeon could use this book as a quick visual reference for more complicated techniques. I would recommend this text for any general practitioner wanting to expand surgical skills to include flaps or to improve closure techniques.\" (Australian Veterinary Journal, 1 March 2011)\"In the preface of this substantial book the author expresses his hope that readers will find it a \"practical, informative and single-source reference for the surgical restoration of our small animal patients\": he has, in my opinion, achieved his aim. I would recommend it without hesitation for those with a heavy surgical caseload (particularly surgical oncology) and for anyone who has a particular interest in wound management and reconstruction.\" (Veterinary Times,March 2011)\"The third edition ofSmall Animal Wound Management and Reconstructive Surgeryis a well-organized text that outlines the process of wound care from basic initial management to complicated reconstructive techniques. The addition of color pictures to the treatment of specific wound types is a welcome addition to previous editions of the text. The book is well written, and the color figures compliment the text well. Throughout the text, the author includes information boxes to emphasize important points and to add personal observations based on his experience. These information boxes add a personal feel and welcome procedural tips to the text that will help novice surgeons. Overall, the third edition of this book is a valuable addition as a reference for experienced surgeons as well as a guide for surgical residents and general practitioners interested in wound management and skin reconstruction.\" (Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, December 2010)\"This book encapsulates the clincial acumen that Dr. Pavletic has derived from 35 years' experience in wound management and reconstructive surgery. There is a good reason why the previous edition of this book is a staple in most surgeons' libraries!\" (Veterinary Record, January 2011)\"The book is written for a wide audience from students or technicians to general practitioners or surgeons.

Julia's books are based on real life\nchallenges she has encountered and solutions she discovered while moving through these challenges.Julia has experienced two floods in Manitou Springs. They both occurred in the late 1990's. Recently a forest fire turned 18,000 acres of beautiful forests into a barren landscape with hydrophobic soil. There are 106 watersheds that drain directly into Manitou Springs and many other cities nearby. The main watershed would follow the path that the William's Canyon Flood followed in 1999 and is pictured within this book.Photography\nis a creative interest Julia actively pursues on all her hikes and travels around\nthe country and world. Capturing unique views of everyday items or the\nhidden beauty in rocks and driftwood or a beautiful flower is her goal.\nThis book is filled with photographs she took when the town was flooded and of the beautifully restored historic buildings that grace Manitou Springs historic downtown area now.Currently\nher creative side, when not writing, is focused on creating fun and\ntransformational feathered Fantafaces masks. She also creates feathered\nhair clips and earrings and enjoys incorporating found objects in her\npins and feather based wall art pieces.Watch for more books in the coming months\nrelated both to be prepared for a Natural Disaster, ways to creating a more sustainable life and ways to enjoy optimum\nhealth and enjoy the abundance of wealth and beauty that this world\noffers us every day.", "related": [], "rank": 2272667, "title": "Lessons from Past Floods: Destruction", "author": "Julia L Wright", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was treasured father to Christopher “Kit” and Melissa; father-in-law to Chris; proud grandfather “Pa” to Lex; once-husband and continued friend to Elaine; and longtime special friend to Olga. He is also survived by several cousins. A professor at both Empire State College and SUNY Albany, and more recently, before retiring in 1992, deputy producing director of the New York State Theater Institute, he mentored, guided, and inspired a community of creative individuals, becoming their respected colleague and friend. A successful director at NYSTI, he was also an author of numerous novels and plays. He was the recipient of a 2004 Audie Award for the audio book adaptation of his play, The Killings Tale and, through NYSTI, he successfully partnered with Warner Home Video and DVD to create a video version of his original work A Tale of Cinderella. A man who believed “children are jewels of immeasurable worth,” he loved long walks, the Red Sox, Cape Cod, music, and inspiring people to believe in the magic within themselves. He will be missed by family and friends alike and would wish to all those in his life, “A bit of sun, and the touch of love’s hand.”", "related": [], "rank": 5050035, "title": "SURPRISE! or Black and White Blues: Adrift in the Red White & Blue Zone", "author": "William A.

I'm Troy Brodsky, and I have a confession to make. I make stuff up for a living. Prior to my incarnation as a semi-lucid writer, I spent about a decade teaching all of the kids who mysteriously disappeared from the public schools. These were the meth kids, the tweakers, and those who fancied a whole bowl of pot before class. The vast majority of them were affiliated with one gang or another, and many had a history of gouge your eyes out violence. I taught everything from 2nd grade reading to college physics every day and it was grand. I moved from there to photography (the profession in which I now happily reside), and now wander around in this vast wasteland of ePub glee from time to time. So here's the quick and dirty on me, because if you've read this far, you've been waiting for the dirty. I don't know Kung-Fu, and I've yet to be arrested. I'm perhaps most comfortable when I'm underwater and have an aversion to adverbs - I love my wife and son, and was once nearly run over by a tank. That's about as quick and dirty as it gets with me. Of course, I'm always available via Facebook as I'm in Shameless Self-Promotion mode for Jury of Peers. (https://www.facebook.com/JuryOfPeers.TroyBrodsky) So stop by, kick up your feet and chat. Or, if you're just decidedly anti-social, I have an app for that: http://juryofpeers.us Cheers, Troy", "related": ["B00F6GHTR0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you\nhave heard a sad story from a friend, family member of neighbor then you know\nhow debilitating it can be to manage your career, find a job, or even stay\nemployed. It does not have to be that way.Everyone needs a plan. A successful job search from either\nthe candidate or the company's perspective starts with a plan. We believe we\noffer a different approach to job search. Our clients get results using the Job\nSearch Marketing Plan we share in this book.The next books in the Job Seeker Manifesto Series have\nalready been written and should be published in the next few months. Resumes\n2.0 and Tell Me About Yourself offer a different perspective on job search\ntools and telling your story during interviews, respectively.

Sometimes the problems come at them from outside, but usually they must confront an ecological disaster that is, however indirectly and passively, their own fault. The results, in this 11-story collection, are compelling if not exactly lighthearted. Closest to being humorous is the nautical \"Day's Hunt,\" a rowdy but scathingly ironic tale in which harpooners chase mutant whales in a sea of liquefying garbage. The title story, on the other hand, imagines superpowerful insects preparing to desert Earth en masse because humans have polluted it so thoroughly. Our mistakes have changed the rules of the game, Murphy insists, so we must decide to understand and adapt—or perish. He still believes we may have a choice. If this sounds like environmentalist preaching, almost all the selections work as stories because they feature believable action in convincingly detailed settings; their message comes across successfully because we do sympathize with the characters' dilemmas and their struggles.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His prose are fresh and engaging, the choice of contributors is wise, and the papers themselves are, at times, nothing short of inspiring. This is a book brimming over with the personal insights of those who have spent a lifetime writing about others. It has been a long time coming, and its arrival is most welcome!\"-Jody Messler Davies, Ph.D,Clinical Professor of Psychology of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.\"Perhaps psychoanalysts are finally ready to admit their need to know what actually goes on in other analysts' minds as they work through their own painful pasts and live through their own tragedies and conflicts. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to know how others reflect on these struggles and integrate them with their clinical work? Fortunately Steven Kuchuck has produced this book, and assembled a set of such reflections from a diverse and thoughtful group of analysts. The result is immensely stimulating and often profound, an aid to all of us who have imagined a more complex role for analytic subjectivity, a more compassionate and honest version of the practice to which we are dedicated.\"-Jessica Benjamin, Ph.D. author,Shadow of the Other(Routledge, 1998),Clinical Professor of Psychology of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis\"Steven Kuchuck has brought together a group of authors who courageously, authentically and skillfully turn their reflective lens on significant personal developmental and life events that have contributed to the shaping of their subjectivities, selection and development of theories, clinical choices and ways of \"being\" within the psychoanalytic arena. This volume is a captivating, edifying, emotionally touching read for all levels of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists.\"-James L. Fosshage, Ph.D., Clinical Professor of Psychology at New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, Co-founder, National Institute for the Psychotherapies.\"In one of the most gripping stories in this book, Anna Ornstein notes, \"The practice of reserving something of oneself from the clutches of an institution…is not an incidental mechanism of defense but rather an essential constituent of the self.\" Many of the compelling stories in Kuchuck’s extraordinary collection illustrate our struggle as individuals, and as a field, to affirm ourselves in face of something deeply institutionalized in psychoanalytic culture: Hiding the analyst’s complex, multiple subjectivity behind sometimes legitimate, but often highly questionable, assumptions about protection, privacy, and effective analytic process. Though psychoanalysis is easiest to critique in its classical, conservative guise, the book’s subtle stories reveal how psychoanalytic culture—even in contemporary, relational and self-psychological forms—often ritualizes and sanctifies the exposure of the patient, and the hiding of the analyst.\"-Malcolm Owen Slavin, Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute for Psychoanalysis.\"In this unforgettable book, Steven Kuchuck brings us personal stories by therapists about experiences that shaped their subjectivity and professional development. The authors are senior clinicians and theoreticians; all adept at thinking and writing about the inner and outer worlds and the spaces between. I couldn't put this book down.\"-Linda Hopkins, Ph.D.\"It should be obvious that a two-person point of view genuinely implies that there are two persons in the room, each with a complicated life history that contributes to shaping what transpires in the session.Yet all too often, the two-person viewpoint remains rarified, a theoretical position but not a personal one. This book provides an important corrective to this tendency. The contributors include a number of the most prominent writers in our field, as well as some talented younger writers, and all provide an admirably personal and reflective perspective on therapeutic practice. This is a genuinely valuable contribution, one that will richly reward the reader and provide both inspiration and insight.\"-Paul L. Wachtel, Ph.

The number of cats in our house changes because I foster for\n a local humane society, usually seniors and ones with health issues. My\n own kitties range in age from 2 to 16 1/2 years old.  I also have two\ndogs, who the cats tolerate. Well, sort of. The dogs know to keep their\ndistance, especially from the older cats!When\n I was asked to write a short Christmas romance story, I'd been dealing\nwith a couple sick cats that not only meant visits to the vet, but trips to an emergency animal hospital.  The setting seemed a\nnatural fit for a short story. I also wanted to rewrite something\n that happened to me while I was writing Home For  Christmas.I\nfound a stray cat in my backyard. Guess my crazy cat lady reputation\nmade the rounds with the local feline crew. Because I foster, I\nknew who to call and they got right to work. A couple hours later, I was\n with the cat, named Shasta by the humane society, at a vet office where\n he received much needed medical attention. I'd received a new foster\ncat the night before so he was taken in by the humane society and placed\n with a different foster. Unfortunately, Shasta didn't survive, but for\nthe last weeks of his life he was comfortable, warm, had plenty to eat\nand was loved. For me, that's what animal rescue and fostering senior\ncats is all about.But I'm a romance writer and prefer happy\nendings. Christmas is a time for magic and miracles so in Mistletoe\n Magic I wrote the ending I wanted for Shasta and every foster/stray cat\n out there.Montana, especially the quaint town of Marietta, is a\n wonderful place to spend the holidays. I hope you enjoy this short\nstory and the three A Copper Mountain Christmas novellas.Melissa", "related": ["B00K8EV4Y4"], "rank": 136209, "title": "Mistletoe Magic (Bar V5 Ranch Book 2)", "author": "Melissa McClone", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 141, "rating_average": 4.227, "rating_total": 596.0}

As well as romantic novels, she wrote historical biographies, 6 autobiographies, theatrical plays and books of advice on life, love, vitamins and cookery. She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world.She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B.

O. Wilson, University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University\"Warriors and Worriersis a fascinating look at male-female differences through a sociobiological lens. Benenson's thought-provoking analysis considers a wide range of influences - biological, psychological and sociological - that illuminate the developmentalforces shaping males into warriors and females into worriers. The book is a lively readnicely balancing scholarly evidence and insight with intriguing anecdotal speculation.Everyone may not agree with Benenson's conclusions, but I imagine all will find themprovocative.\" -- Donald J. Campbell, Professor of Management & Leadership, United States Military Academy\"We have been lead to believe that girls are empathetic creatures who value female friendship above all else and that boys are competitive beasts unable to form deep and lasting bonds with other males. InWarriors and Worriers, Benenson and Markovits formidably demonstrate that girls are, in fact, designed by evolution to compete with each other for reproductive resources while boys are designed to form tightly knit and forgiving groups to defend collectively their reproductive assets. We have ignored this truth that we see every day in play groups, at schools, in board rooms, and at faculty meetings. But now we haveWarriors and Worriersto explain in conversational language what made life so hard as teenagers and what haunts us as adults - that girls and women are really the competitive ones while boys and men are actually very good at being social. What an amazingparadigm shift, and one that makes so much sense.\" -- Meredith Small, Professor of Anthropology, Cornell University\"We all know men and women are different. InWarriors and Worriers, Joyce Benensontells us the ultimate reason why they are. Men and women have evolved and developeddifferent psychologies, men to identify enemies and defend against them and women tocare for and worry about their children. In this highly readable and authoritative book,Benenson shows how biology and environment interact over the life span to produce maleand female minds and why -- not just how -- men and women are different. This is an important book for anyone interested in sex differences, and admit it, we all are.\" -- David F. Bjorklund, Professor of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University\"Benenson (psychology, Emmanuel Coll.) argues for innate behavioral differences between men and women. She organizes these differences under two umbrella categories called warriors and worriers. Benenson suggests that these demeanors contribute to our survival and have over time become encoded in our genes. Benenson fuels the debate on whether gender differences in behavior are constructed or biological. Her argument is based upon observations of early childhood across cultures as well as primate studies. The critiques appear universal, and Benenson, working within the school of evolutionary psychology, provides a possible explanation.

It was originally about John and his team fighting the drug gang and was named the \"Trip\". After seeing what our leaders are capable of doing to undermine our constitutional rights, it was only a short leap of faith to add a president who is a traitor to his country. When I finished the first book, several friends said that it was pretty good and helped me with some editing. I secretly hoped it would sell a few books, but never thought I'd see the success that the books have achieved. I will keep writing The Adventures of John Harris as long as it is fun for me. I really get involved in the story and wonder what John does next.       I am also writing Grumpy, Sam and Sammy. This is a story about a couple who have had several tragedies in their lives and get a second chance by helping a wayward young girl and her dog. This is more of a religious awakening and heart warming kind of book, Not the book for the post-apocalyptic crowd, but never fear I am also outlining a series of books about our upcoming 2nd civil war. The series is named Civil War II. The first book is Executive orders. It has the scenario of a misguided president who begins to rule by decree and alienates the silent majority so much they revolt. I wonder if any other writer is writing four books at the same time. Oops I failed to mention another \"Self Help\" book that is a tongue in cheek manual for surviving the hoards of hungry city people who leave the big cities just to eat your food, molest your wife and kill you.Writing is my hobby and unfortunately I have to keep my day job for a while.Thanks to my fans for the support and great sales.Have a great day.", "related": [], "rank": 197003, "title": "Surviving", "author": "AJ Newman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 3.5882, "rating_total": 61.0}

His famous book, \"Leaves of Grass,\" filters that era through the lens of poetry, its descriptions barely acceptable in his day.  \"Cigars in the Parlor\" explores what Whitman could not say - the quiet explorations of desperate men finding each other in the dark.Cigars in the Parlor was a departure for me - I had never published in a serialized format before.  Writing, editing, and then publishing a chapter in a week proved to be an exciting experiment.  I sincerely hope you enjoy \"Cigars in the Parlor\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has travelled widely and now splits her time between her home in England and a tiny rural village in the Peloponnese, in Greece, where she is (very slowly!) renovating a ruined stone farmhouse, whilst observing the Greek way of life and absorbing the culture, to enrich her vision for both writing and painting. Sara began writing later in life. In school English lessons were a time of confusion, books indecipherable hieroglyphics. Dyslexia was not well understood then and no support was available. The joy of reading and writing were cancelled by the teacher's red pen ... Despite her dyslexia Sara qualified as a psychotherapist and ran her own practice for years. Her artistic nature was, at that time, confined to painting and she exhibited widely. In a casual conversation with a client she discovered that Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and Hans Christian Andersen were all dyslexic, and Sara's perspective changed. The world of fiction opened to her with this shift in perception and she has been a prolific writer ever since. Her 'Greek Village Series' has been very well received and provides a keenly observed, compassionate insight into the Greek people and culture, and the human condition in general. Watch this space for the next in the series, coming soon!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.9091, "rating_total": 54.0}
