Druett reaches far back in history, opening her lively book with an account of the water-coursing Massegetae queen Tomyris, who bested the Persian king Cyrus on the shores of the Volga River. Druett enlists dozens of other militarily, criminally, and commercially extraordinary women in her dramatis personae, including the Egyptian pharaoh Cleopatra, whose name is synonymous with mysterious beauty but who also commanded a mighty navy; Cheng I Sao, the 18th-century terror of the South China Sea; and Lucy Brewer, who, disguised as a man, served as a common sailor aboard the U.S.S.Constitution. Along the way Druett considers the role of New England women as financial mainstays of the whaling trade, stops at Spanish ports of call controlled by powerful (and sometimes bloodthirsty) women, and generally has a fine time exploring waters that history has little charted.--Gregory McNamee", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He tossed two tens down as they rose to head back to work.\"Okay, so it hasn't been every case.\" She plucked a twenty from her purse and exchanged it for his bills. She handed him back a ten. \"I pay my own way, remember?\"\"No,\" her friend said, but he took the money.How many years had they done the same dance? Stephen Creighton was a Southern gentleman, born and bred. And a gentleman took care of a lady's lunch. Even when the man was happily married, and the lady in question was resistant to all gestures smacking of her needing to be taken care of.\"It's just lunch.\" He grabbed their briefcases and handed over hers.\"Right. And Downing isjustanother cop I have to grill on the stand this afternoon.\"She hustled through the Courthouse Deli's double glass doors and into the atrium, fighting the memory of how good being in Downing's arms had felt. They'd driven each other crazy. And if it had just been about sex, maybe it would have ended there. But after the fog had cleared from her brain, she'd been horrified by her weakness for him. By how much more she'd needed.Too much more.She'd tried to pull away first. Tried to tell him to leave. But Rick had been holding her so close, as if she was something precious he knew he couldn't keep. And somehow she'd ended up clinging, just a little, whenhe'dsilently handed her her clothes, put his own on and left.They'd faced each other in court the next day, and practically every workday since. Both pretending what had happened wasno big deal.But Emma had an entire afternoon of no big deal ahead of her, and her legendary control in the courtroom was starting to crumble.She followed Stephen toward the marble stairs to the left of the courthouse entrance. The historic building was teeming with hustling bodies. Walking up the two flights of stairs would be light-years faster than waiting for one of the antiquated elevators.\"I'm sorry for being such a grouch,\" she said. \"I don't know what's wrong with me.\"\"Maybe it's this case.\" Stephen turned right as they reached the third floor. \"Your defendant's such a jerk, you half want the prosecution to win this time. And I think that pisses you off, as much as the potshots Rick takes at your defense strategy every time he testifies.\"\"Maybe,\" she agreed, even though she knew better. \"I— Wait a minute.Rick?\" They paused outside the courtroom where Stephen, one of the top independent legal-aid attorneys in town, had been representing his own client all week. \"Since when is Lieutenant Downing,Rickto you?\"Stephen shrugged. \"He and Kate's brother grab a beer once a week or so. Martin was already part of Neal's and my Thursday-night game, so when he mentioned bringing Rick along one night—\"\"You and your boss are playing poker with that smug weasel!\" Emma smiled sweetness at the strangers who stared as they passed by. She cleared her throat and toned down her rant. \"You're playing cards with the police officer who lives to antagonize me.\"\"Rick's a good guy, Emma. Whatever hate-on you've got going for him—\"\"Hate-on!\"Stephen held his hands up, pleading for mercy.\"He's just—\" he started.\"Going to get back to court before I do.\" Emma smacked her friend on the arm in retaliation for defending the current bane to her existence. \"Give Kate my love, you big traitor.\"\"You and Jessie still on for Sunday dinner?\" Stephen asked as Emma headed for her own courtroom. \"Luigi's, in Virginia Highlands?\"\"Sure.\" She waved without turning back. \"And you better believe you're buying this time. Remember, Jessie likes pepperoni supreme, extra toppings.\"She marched toward her courtroom and her next showdown with the police lieutenant her job forced her to see nearly every day. The handsome devil whose dedication and passion for the law had gotten to her, even if he was the son of the man who'd helped ruin Emma's life.Rick Downing is a good guy, my ass.He was the enemy, no matter what Stephen or her hormones thought. And she'd damn well better not forget it.Emma Montgomery had no business looking so flustered and feminine and flat-out stunning as she hustled into the courtroom. Rick tried not to notice the moisture misting across her peaches-and-cream complexion, compliments of the humid August day outside. Or how her blond hair curled around her face, framing delicate features and intelligent, cat-green eyes.Good luck!He'd run his hands through that hair. He'd held Emma's body close as they'd both lost their minds. Sure she'd shut him out after, and he'd secretly been grateful for the brush-off. But he'd sipped at all that skin that was as silky to the touch as it appeared to the eye. And now, his eyes were the only things allowed to feast on Emma. So he let his gaze drink its fill, while she ignored him so completely it was clear she knew he was there.How the woman looked, he reminded himself, wasn't nearly as important as what she had up her designer sleeves that afternoon. Sitting at the back of the courtroom, Rick forced his mind to focus on the job. Monty never missed a chance to work whatever legal angle she could. And their one-night indiscretion had only upped her motivation to bust his balls on the stand. If he wasn't on his toes today, one of the sleaziest criminals he'd ever collared might walk free.She was late returning from lunch, and Emma was never carelessly late for anything. It didn't matter that Judge Mathers had been delayed, too. Whatdidmatter was that Rick was overdue for his afternoon shift and needed to return to the central precinct as soon as possible. Of course, Emma had been pushing all morning for one continuance and break after another, dragging things out intentionally.Monty was as good as they came at her job. Her closing arguments could beguile a preacher into giving Satan a second chance at wings. But lately, even before they'd slept together, it had seemed as though her passion to defend her clients had turned into a personal vendetta against him.Rick stood and closed in on the defendant's table, watching Emma pause beside the ex-con he'd arrested for possession with intent to distribute. Rick's irritation went from simmer to boil when Emma bent to speak with her client, and Tanner Simmons used the opportunity to leer down her blouse. Rick didn't stop moving until he was obstructing the creep's view.\"You're really okay with turning this guy back onto the streets, Monty?\" he asked. The delicate muscles along Emma's neck tensed as she straightened. \"I know you've got the ethics of what you PDs do rationalized to perfection. But this is a new low, even for you. I made a clean arrest. This guy's guilty as hell. You and everyone else here knows it.\"Emma smiled her disarming, Southern-belle smile.\"Thank you, Lieutenant,\" she purred, \"for making my point for me. It's because of things thateveryonelike you knows, that PDs like me fight for every suspect's right to a vigorous defense. Even the guilty ones.\"Tanner's gaze shifted from roaming Emma's curves to staring Rick down.\"You heard the bitch,\" the gangbanger sneered. \"Piss off.\"\"Watch your mouth!\" Rick barked in unison with Emma.Her scowl was all the thanks Rick got for helping defend her honor.\"I need to speak privately with my client,\" she said. \"So, if you'll excuse us…\"Her glare promised Tanner it wasn't going to be a friendly chat.She turned her back, dismissing Rick with an ease that she didn't quite pull off. Her almost-imperceptible cringe, as Simmons's stare continued cataloging her assets, said she wouldn't be heartbroken to see her current client rack up his third felony conviction in ten years.\"You're one ballsy bitch,Ms.Montgomery.\" Simmons lifted hands that had been cuffed in front of him. He rubbed the backs of his fingers along the sleeve of Montgomery's conservative jacket. \"Just the kind of bitch I need by my side in a corrupt legal system.\"Emma's composure disintegrated into disgust, but she eased away with dignity. Only then did Rick's hand relax around the handgun holstered to his hip.Damn.Get over yourself.He'd seen Montgomery handle tougher customers than the piece of scum trying to rattle her now. And she clearly wouldn't appreciate any further intervention on his part. Still, Rick took a seat behind the defense's table, rather than the assistant district attorney's. Not that theballsyPD would appreciate his concern, if she noticed him there. Which she pretended she didn't.Instead, she stayed focused on the creep she'd been defending all week, staring Tanner down until the guy looked away. The bailiff announced the judge's return from lunch break.

As hooks parallels the environmental crime of mountaintop-removal coal mining with the injustices poor people face, she retrieves the lost stories of black farmers and ponders the psychological consequences of the great migration to the industrialized, urban North, and the degradation of tobacco from a sacred plant to a deadly product. Paying tribute to her quilt-maker grandmother, who instilled in her a “spiritual aesthetic,” hooks, at once intellectually rigorous and warmly personal, creates a quilt of radiant essays that defines a “culture of belonging” rooted in reverence for life and a genuine involvement with place and community. --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Burton is a good read. There are so many self-help books in the market on how to snag that man, get that man for yourself, hitch a mate and stuff like that, but this time round, this book is about how to keep your man; say after being married or after being in a relationship with him. I think that's crucial.Most relationships don't go longer than the `hitching' part. And that's where tips like what the writer had suggested in the book appear to be very useful. Number 1: It's because he is a male himself and his insights on the male mind is very valuable and informative. Number 2: Sometimes, it is easy to get that 'spark' back in a relationship and to keep it rolling for a longer time and more, but the magic essence is missing and one needs to study and get it.That's what the book offers, and I've yet to master it. But I will try my best and nab that man of mine, like a long time, or perhaps forever?

The equipment was supposed to identify IEDs so that they could be safely removed before killing troops and civilians. It turned out to be totally fake. An evaluation of the equipment by the U.S. Army proved it was fake. Other tests run by various governments also found it useless. The British company making this fake stuff was making millions. Those deploying the equipment were lead to believe it would save lives, but instead thousands of innocent people were being killed because this fake equipment simply didn't work. Then I ran across a BBC expose of the crooks that accused them, showed it was a scam and challenging the British government to do something about it. Nothing happened. I got hopping mad when I found out the stuff was still being sold, not only in Iraq but in Afghanistan, Nigeria, Mexico and even China. So, I decided to use the scam as background for my next Bob Steck novel, published in 2010. As far as I know, the buggers are still (in early 2012) selling this stuff and the Brits have allowed the company to continue operating.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Clarke's penchant for understatement, there a taste of Asimov's subtle bait-and-switch. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Powell's most moving chapter is \"Nanuk\" (\"Polar Bear\"), but not because, circa 2084, global warming's poster-beasts only survive in zoos.

Under Porfirio Díaz, Mexico sought to carve out respectability in the eyes of its northern neighbor. Jayes notes that this effort failed, leaving a legacy of misunderstanding and ignorance toward Mexico and its people in the eyes of many in the US. She argues that Mexican stereotypes, constructed through experiences by three groups (diplomats, tourists, and merchants) shaped US views toward Mexico that persist today. Despite the Díaz administration's attempt to cast Mexico as a modern and viable economic and cultural counterpart, US observers developed a fascination with Mexico's primitive past instead of its modern potential. Easy to read and comprehend while offering good detail and quality research, this is a solid entry for faculty or students interested in Mexico or US foreign relations. Summing Up: Recommended. All academic libraries.(CHOICE)The Illusion of Ignoranceis an original and well-written book that utilizes a wide variety of travel accounts from the era. The author revels how stereotypical images if Mexico not only severed to de-legitimatize Mexico’s sovereignty, but also influenced how Americans saw the world. Thus, although the focus of the book is on the Porfiriatio and its aftermath, it sheds light on our present-day interaction with the world that is expressed in a combination of ‘interest and aversion’.(Southwestern Historical Quarterly)", "related": [], "rank": 4557454, "title": "The Illusion of Ignorance", "author": "Janice Lee Jayes", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I liked that the story moved along and didn't seem to get stuck anywhere and the author did not drag out the ending.The next two reviews are on Smashwords.com at smashwords.com/books/view/102502Review by: Hariot Simpson on May 11, 2012 : 4/5 starsThis was a story like many fantasy stories with not much new, but the author was able to tell it with strong enough characters to keep the story interesting and keep me turning the pages long into the night. Although this story reached a logical conclusion, I can see easily how the characters could be woven into many other stories and I hope that Coburn chooses to write more. It would be a real shame if he doesn't.Review by: John Armbruster on May 04, 2012 : 4/5 starsI love fantasy books but find that in so many of them the plot is transparent and the characters flat. Not true of this one. The plot is a bit transparent but it was fun anyway. The characters are well developed and multi-dimensional and the story was generally well written and hard to put down. I loved the Harry Potter books as everyone did, but I like the interesting way this author gave the characters powers rather than giving them a magic wand like Harry Potter. I know it's not a completely unique approach, but I liked the way this author handled it. I must say I'm disappointed that there aren't other fantasy books by him though I certainly hope there will be in the future. I will watch for them and read them whether they are follow-ons to this one or completely different story lines.", "related": ["B005BCO8DM"], "rank": 2373099, "title": "Order of the White Feather", "author": "Edward J.

[Airplanes had propellers in those days and the Pacific Ocean is vast.]Along the way, he acquired the original publications of Captain Cook’s journal of his third Pacific voyage wherein the good Captain explored much of both sides of the Pacific Ocean. From these three volumes, Dr. Dale prepared an edited an annotated publication of his voyage titled: Seventy North to Fifty South, Captain Cook’s Last Voyage brought out by Prentice-Hall in 1969.After his military service, Dr. Dale established his medical practice in Greenwich, Connecticut where, with his wife Dorothy, they raised five children all of whom were introduced to sailing at an early age.His research for The Tonga Book took him to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Hawaii and yes, Great Britain and New Zealand too. In 1978 he was engaged to be the Chief of Mental Health Services for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, stationed in Saipan. From these Pacific islands he moved to join the faculty of the John A.

Endangered Species\" book: the Sloth which is capable of layawaying on a branch.Like the other animals from Fay's book , also the NXT Sloth is a both exceptional as well as entertaining robot.Building time: app 60 minProgramming time: 10 minDifficulty level for children: mediumAfter having worked through the complete book now, I can draw the conclusion that all the five models reflect Fay's particular skill in mimicking the physique and the motion patterns of real-world animals with LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT. Apart from some minor things (which mostly are adressed already on the accompanying web  site) I was able to follow the elaborate and well commented building and programming instructions without any problem.Because of the appealing models, the well adapted level of difficulty, the particular topic, the extensibility of the robots (of which Fay proposes some in the appendix) and the didactic part at the end of the book,  \"Endangered  Species\" in my opinion is a very good choice both for parents who are in search of a book for their child accompanying the newly bought NXT 2.0 set as well as for teachers who are looking for a guide to their  robotic classes.posted on the NXTStep blog, February 14, 2010, by Matthias Paul Scholz", "related": [], "rank": 2276177, "title": "Robots Alive!

Más tarde vivió en Cuba y obtuvo numerosas riquezas gracias a los repartimientos y encomiendas. En 1514 regresó a España, y renunció a todas sus propiedades. Afectado por su experiencia americana, pretendió imponer un nuevo modelo de evangelización y se convirtió en un ferviente defensor de los derechos de los indios. Sin embargo, su actitud provocó la enemistad de obispos, gobernadores y miembros del poderoso e influyente Consejo de Indias. En 1520 volvió a América para poner en práctica en Cumaná (Venezuela) sus ideas sobre una colonización pacífica. Fracasó. Años después predicó en tierras de Nicaragua y Guatemala, hasta que en 1540 regresó a España, donde fue uno de los más destacados impulsores de las Leyes Nuevas (1542). Nombrado obispo en Sevilla, en 1544, tomó posesión de la diócesis de Chiapas (provincia de la capitanía general de Guatemala), allí denunció los crímenes de los colonos. Tuvo muchos enemigos. En 1546 pasó a México y un año después regresó a España. Durante esta época redactó su Historia de las Indias (1552-1561), publicada en 1875. Su defensa de los indígenas le hizo reclamar la presencia de negros africanos para que trabajasen como esclavos en América en lugar de aquéllos.", "related": ["B002WN2XYO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's why I write Historical Romance. I use history as wallpaper. It gives the reader a base to envision the time. When I wrote The Blackthorn Trilogy, I researched the eleventh century after the Norman Conquest. I used William the Conqueror and Hereward the Wake to help readers envision the times. I selected the twelfth century when I decided to write The Raptor Castle Series. It was a century filled with interesting happenings. Deciding on the plot for Book One, Forbidden, I wanted an unusual hero -- a monk forced from his abbey to sire children. You can't get a story more original than that, can you? Ack! Don't suck your teeth. It really did happen. I've always been fascinated with the clan Macpherson and its motto: Touch not the cat bot (without) a glove. During the reign of David the First, Gillicattan, a significant figure, became captain of the clan Chattan. He sired two sons. After he passed away, his eldest son took over but died without issue. Gillicattan's second son, Murdoch was the Abbot of Kingussie in Badenoch. The duty of leading the clan landed on Murdoch's lap. After the Pope granted a dispensation, the Abbot became head of his family and captain of the clan Chattan. He married and sired five sons.The modern name Macpherson literally means son of the parson.It was fun to borrow a bit of history and make Ranald, the hero of Forbidden, ascarred monk in Scotland's Kelso Abbey. When angered, he caused objects to fly about, turned still waters stormy and caused candles to light with but a look. In the peace of the abbey, he controlled his rage and fought his forbidden desires. But what would he become if forced to return to the secular world? It was his greatest fear.His identical twin dies the day before the twin is to wed Catalin of Hunter Castle. Refusing to lose the bride's fortune, the Chief of Raptor Castle arrives at Kelso Abbey with an army and a special dispensation from the Pope. The Chief demands that Ranald will marry Catalin. If he refuses, the Chief will destroy the Abbey and all within.It was very mean of me, but I took Ranald's greatest fear and made his personality change, little-by-little, until he was no longer a kindly man but a man of the times.", "related": [], "rank": 1008718, "title": "Forbidden (The Raptor Castle Series Book 1)", "author": "Sophia Johnson", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 24.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of.My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": ["B004WX1DHK"], "rank": 389267, "title": "Proto Zoa eBook", "author": "Lois McMaster Bujold", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was so different from the South Dakota prairie where he grew up. Just a few years later, he began summer employment at the Charles L. Sommers Boy Scout Canoe Base as a guide, taking Boy Scouts on eight-day canoe trips into the wilderness. It was the most fun and rewarding job he ever had and provided the background for majority of the tales in this book. He loves to see what is around the next point, what is beyond the horizon, what is over the next hill-and he loves to find out by paddling there in his canoe. In his later years, he is still taking church groups, friends, and family members into the North Woods that he has grown to love. He and his wife, Midge, and their families all live in the land of ten thousand lakes, Minnesota, residing near each other in South Saint Paul, just a four-hour drive away from the Bound.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy, monodrama, and history plays, to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques. From his earliest work, Strindberg developed forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition so innovative that many were to become technically possible to stage only with the advent of film. He is considered the \"father\" of modern Swedish literature and his The Red Room (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. In Sweden Strindberg is both known as a novelist and a playwright, but in most other countries he is almost only known as a playwright.", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": 45240, "title": "Plays", "author": "August Strindberg", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I applaud Scarecrow for publishing such an in-depth portrait, and only wish (wistfully) that someone had been able to sit down with, say, Brew Moore or Benny Morton or a hundred others. But this book is a model of what can be done to illuminate jazz from the inside as well as chronicling one artist's passage through it.(Jazz Lives)It is compelling reading for educators, musicians, and fans.(The New York City Jazz Record)Creating a full picture of who Liebman is and what he's accomplished is an ongoing and incremental process, where a great many pieces must be put together like a complex jigsaw puzzle, including keeping abreast of a travel schedule for recording, performing and education that would wither most musicians half the near-66 year-old saxophonist's age. Thankfully,What It Is: The Life of a Jazz Artistis a long-overdue career retrospective—albeit one of an artist who is still very much a work in progress—that helps bring all these pieces, if not exactly together, then at least on the same board where it's possible to draw a number of important conclusions.(All About Jazz)Dave Liebman has always been one of the smartest and most forthcoming musicians of his generation, and in his new book,What It Is: The Life of a Jazz Artist, the saxophonist and educator holds forth on his art, life and restless creative spirit with effortless candor and lyricism…. Liebman has a refreshingly down-to-earth view of his own legacy as a musician, but he recognizes the importance of his responsibility to properly instruct and influence the next generation of jazz talent…. Porter proves a skilled interviewer, gracefully guiding Liebman from topic to topic while occasionally contributing his own thoughts on the subjects at hand. The obvious conviviality of the interview sessions carries over to the reading experience itself, makingWhat It Isa brisk, intelligent, always entertaining journey through the life of one of contemporary jazz’s most inexhaustibly engaging artists.(JazzTimes Magazine)The span of the book gives the impression of a man and artist who knows himself to the utmost, who has examined his efforts both artistic and personal to grow into the inspiring figure he has become, from player to educator to family man to globetrotting jazz lynchpin.(Ottawa Citizen)On the final page of this never flagging and informative conversation the saxophonist tells his interlocutor about Miles Davis showing him a picture of Louis Armstrong and him (Miles) together and telling him (Liebman), “From him to me to you.” That Liebman respects that same sense of obligation to his musical forebears is made abundantly clear throughout the volume as he relates his own history, which included associations with Miles, Elvin Jones, Ravi Coltrane, Joe Lovano, Michael and Randy Brecker, and many others, the New York loft jazz scene, and a day job as a New York substitute teacher.(W. Royal Stokes)Liebman holds nothing back. He speaks frankly of having had polio, of John Coltrane’s influence on him, of his lessons with Lennie Tristano, his time in Charles Lloyd’s band, his work with Chick Corea and Elvin Jones, concerts and recordings with Miles Davis, his collaboration with Richie Beirach and John Scofield, of Lookout Farm and Quest, of his idea of teaching jazz and the state of jazz, of his activities at the International Association of Schools of Jazz, and much more. All of it oscillates between anecdotes and profound thought. Porter not only keeps topics going, most importantly, he knows what Liebman is talking about and follows up with the right questions, enabling readers unfamiliar with Liebman’s career to follow the story, as well as asking the kinds of things an expert would like to know.(Jazzinstitut Darmstadt)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author is not a doctor, but rather a student of Chinese civilization, and his medical explanation ranges from shaky to irresponsible. For instance, he refers to \"toxemia\" as a \"state of toxicity in the blood and tissues,\" though medical parlance already defines \"toxemia\" as a sometimes-fatal pregnancy complication. Specific claims come without any documentation, such as his statement, attributed to \"several studies,\" that \"five glasses of pure water per day ... may reduce ... risk of colon cancer by 45 percent, breast cancer by 80 percent, and bladder cancer by 50 percent.\" Most disconcerting are the dubious medical interventions he touts, such as the \"Zapper,\" an electronic parasite-removal device he suggests as a treatment for \"asthma, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, and candida fungal infections.\" More reliable sources on detoxification can be found in any self-help section.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Creative writing was her favourite subject because she liked “to make my friends laugh and cry.” Her summers were spent in the outdoors enjoying nature both in her native Canada and ancestral Switzerland. Sitting on a sunny porch she read book after book and wrote her own stories.  In high school Andrea became the editor of the school newspaper, wrote articles, reviewed books and interviewed people. She explored the works of Charles Dickens, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, Jane Austen and William Shakespeare. Andrea was thrilled to win the Grade 13 Creative Writing award. She is an English literature major from York University with a passion for sharing good literature with her students. A teacher since 1985 it was through her stories that she first became interested in working with children. “Watching their little faces when I read spooky stories to them gave me an adrenaline rush.”  She pursued her Masters of Education after her first five years of teaching specializing in language, literacy and literature across the curriculum. She continued to write short stories, one of which was published in a mystery magazine in the U.S. In the summers she continued to write stories, two children’s novels and an adult gothic mystery novel all of which ended up in a filing cabinet when she went back to teach each September. Andrea’s great passion for theatre manifested itself in twenty five years of writing and directing student productions of Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol”, “Oliver Twist”, “Great Expectations”, “David Copperfield” and other plays to make literature come alive for her students. She has contributed numerous articles to Voice, an Ontario Teachers Magazine highlighting the phenomenal work her students are doing in literacy and the arts. Andrea’s first novel, Swamped, was published in 2010 because her husband pushed her to “stop throwing stuff in that filing cabinet” and approach publishers. She is currently working on her second children’s novel and is putting Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” on stage with her grade five and six students.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And the game continues. He returns with Mom and a \"wiggle\" in a blanket—the family has a new baby. And still the wordplay goes on until bedtime when there's a story with a barn in it and inside the barn there is, once again, a horse.

He remained in Seattle until joining the Navy shortly after graduating from high school. After completing his naval service, he went to work for The Boeing Company while attending college part time.   In 1971, he relocated to Denver, Colorado where he pursued his college degrees on a full-time basis—graduating from Loretto Heights College (now Regis University) in 1973 with two B.A. degrees (Behavioral Sciences & Sociology) and then on to the University of Colorado where he obtained an M.A. degree in Sociology (1974).  In 1978, he returned to Seattle and The Boeing Company before taking early retirement in 2003. Aside from writing his first novel, Flight Surgeon, he has written a full-length musical play, Blind Love, which awaits musical composition.  He has also written a play, along with his son Ryan, for his eighth-grade class, The Man Who Lost His Way. In addition to plays and short stories, he has crafted over two-hundred poems along with an animated story for young readers (Fluffy); all of which remain to be published. He has two adult children, Brendan and Ryan, and has recently taken up residence in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he spends his time writing his next novel (between swim breaks). He is a voracious reader of novels and attends mass weekly at his local parish.", "related": ["B002FU6LYC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Early exhibiting musical, mathematical and verbal skills, he learned to read before he turned four, skipped kindergarten and was primarily self-taught afterward. With his father's extensive library as an invaluable resource, he graduated ninth in his class at Yorktown High School in New York, earned his BA in Mathematics at Grinnell College and, after four years as an Industry Economist for FERC, returned to school to earn his MA in Mathematics from Carnegie-Mellon University. His professional career has delved into the areas of mathematics, economics and computer science in various combinations. His artistic development has grown from his early reputation as \"the singer\" of the family with impromptu singing and dancing performances for his older brothers' elementary school classes and town summer day camp, improvisations on his grandparents' pump organ and any available piano at home or school, frequent recitations of poetry with some of his own, trumpet instruction from J. Harold Gustafson (a family friend), lead and solo French Horn in high school and arranging some hymns for horn duet. Through his college, early professional and graduate school years, he used proofreading skills honed in his first programming job at BOCES during his senior year in editing the Christian newsletter on campus, in getting letters to the editor and poems printed in various local newspapers, including The Washington Post, and in writing several books. During those years and afterward, he also composed several works of music for which, as for his books, he has only recently begun the process of releasing to the larger public beyond family, friends and church. Along the way, he has also submitted urban designs, receiving an honorable mention and a small prize for a redesign of Ithaca's Octopus which included canals, \"Ponte Vecchio\"-style bridges and a port on and around Inlet Island. Also, starting shortly after graduate school, Mr. Klapper has been deeply engaged in raising four delightful, brilliant and creative children who have already eclipsed him in many ways.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Terry’s love for “all things creative” grew with him through his adolescence, but it was when he first heard the song ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’ by Bob Dylan that sealed his love for poetry and lyric writing. This profound event sent Terry on a quest to become an avid songwriter in order to fuse his two passions of writing and music.  A published poet of such works as Flash of Blue, Patricia, and Doors & Walls (p. American Poet,) Terry continuously works on cultivating his craft though writing lyrics with other musicians. Terry has collaborated on two CD’s that can be heard on several central Illinois college radio stations, and also co-wrote the song Freedom Calls that was featured in the Indie film Hallelujah I’m A Bum.  As a transgender person who believes in God, Terry’s poetry and song collaborations provided him with an emotional outlet to help find his place in the world. It was through this confusing, but perspective-deepening journey in life that Terry has found his real identity as a man. It’s Terrys true self that comes through in his work, and he hopes it both entertains and helps deepen his readers lives.  Terry lived in various parts of the US such as Tennessee and Colorado where he grew a deep appreciation for the the Rocky Mountains and the lands of the West. Recently Terry moved back to his hometown of Mattoon, IL where he is working on several book projects. When he is not writing he can be found in his studio creating surrealistic paintings with musically-oriented themes, and laughing at the antics of his adopted feline-Americans, Hootie & Pepster.", "related": ["B009NOA6N0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When told that the King James Bible was not the Word of God, he faced a crisis. This crisis started a burning fire in his soul to discover where the Word of God is located. The results of that challenge has enabled him to reproduce a well written and powerfully researched defense of the Word of God as found in The King James Version of the Bible. We owe a debt of gratitude to Troy Clark for giving us this excellent addition to our library. He once again confirms what we have known through the years. God has preserved His Inspired Word in the King James Bible.We are honored that our Dear Lord has raised up another generation to hand to their generation the pure Word of God. Troy Clark has done a masterful job in drawing the appropriate line in the sand that The King James Bible is indeed The Word of our God!Dr. Ron Baity, PastorWinston Salem, NCReturn America,Founder  I commend the preparation, presentation of historical facts, and honest reporting. I found this book to be one that will be deeply appreciated by God's servants who study and preach the precious truths of God's Word. God bless you for a job well done, and may our Lord get all the honor and glory.J. Earl Green, PastorGreenville, SCThe Perfect Biblebook will help many understand the foundation of the 1611 King James Bible, and that it came by God. Also, each chapter will guide and ground many believers to future belief in the perfection of Holy Scripture.Dr. Troy Clark makes many great statements about our providentially preserved Bible. One statement is, “Word equals Word”. Another is, “The King James Bible is not a version (paraphrase). It is the Holy Bible”. These two validated points are worth the entire book.Dr. Clark clarifies that we have a perfect Bible so an imperfect world can see our perfect Savior. I recommend this great time consuming work.Dr. Jimmie M. Clark, EvangelistLexington, NCFarmer Christian Academy,Founder I would like to recommend the book entitled “The Perfect Bible” by Dr. Troy Clark and thank God for a man who stands by the King James Version of the Bible. There are so many different versions in print today that leave out words and parts of the Scriptures. Dr. Clark has spent many years in research and does an excellent job in explaining why we believe in the King James Version.It is an honor to recommend this book to you, and I believe it will be a help and blessing to those who truly want to know the truth. In II Timothy 3:16 we read, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:”  I do believe that “The Perfect Bible” will help each of us have a greater understanding of the wonderful Word of God.Dr. Bobby Roberson, PastorWalkertown, NC", "related": [], "rank": 1287067, "title": "The Perfect Bible", "author": "Troy Clark", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dick to launch this novel was not arbitrary. There are those among us who believe Mr. Dick was one of the truly original science fiction writers of the 20th Century. Where so many popular writers were of the time derivative and commercial, Mr. Dick always seemed to surprise and astound.PKD had a small following during his writing life, living in near poverty most of that time. He had a strong fan base among the science fiction community during that time, and won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1963. But the author guesses that many younger readers of science fiction today are not familiar with his name, despite ten popular movies based on his work having been made in recent years, including Blade Runner, The Minority Report, Total Recall, Johnny Menonmic, Imposter, Paycheck, and A Scanner Darkly.(I find it tragic that the first of these films, Blade Runner, which was loosely--very loosely--derived from PKD's novella, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was released three months after his death.)I guess it's some hypocritical of me to complain about derivative works based on PKD's work because this book--this author--owes a lot to PKD. But I swear I didn't set out to be so imitative. Maybe it  was because in 1992, as I was writing Shibboleth,  the standard fare of science fiction being published left a lot to be desired in terms of originality. Consequently, I found myself repeatably re-reading several of his novels, particularly Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and, my personal favorite, The Game Players of Titan.What I found so intriguing about about PKD's novels are his protagonists. They're not exactly anti-heros, but they certainly aren't of the conventional strain either. Instead, PKD was a master of writing the \"Everyman,\" an ordinary person, whom the  reader can identify with, who sometimes, in a painful, embarrassing, but all-to-human fashion,  finds himself in extraordinary circumstances.As an interesting side note, it is well-documented  PKD was a paranoid schizophrenic. He admitted being so himself in  his journals, and he also drew upon his own schizophrenic experiences in his novels. They are the Everyman, but the Everyman who has a very tenuous grasp of reality.But though I wanted to emulate PKD with an Everyman protagonist, I really didn't set out to write a tribute to him. I just couldn't help myself. Plot twists and turns began to develop in my novel that would, after I wrote them, made me go back to my favorite PKD novels to check if I was unconsciously plagiarizing him. I wasn't, but occasionally I felt I was coming too close for comfort. It was as if I was possessed by PKD; as if I was channeling him. So to finish the novel without having a nervous breakdown myself, I gave into the channeling. I just let go with my PKD possession. I named my protagonist's hallucinatory personality after PKD. I let my talking cars be abusive and snippy. And I allowed my conspiratorial side plots to blossom until they took on the aspects of a full-blow psychotic break.Still, I'm a bit too reality-based to truly imitate PKD's schizophrenic genius. I wrote the original draft of this novel in the early 1990s, before cell phones, computer tablets, a time when scientists talked of the Greenhouse Effect but the mass media had yet to make the buzzwords like Global Warming a household word. But even then the large computer models, though rudimentary by 2012 standards, were predicting wholesale disruptions in climate, and I wrote of  a long extended drought followed by a peculiar shift in the Atlantic Ocean temperature oscillations that turned the Midwest into a tropical rainforest. Amazingly, the extended drought and the extreme weather has become a reality.Still,  I had to rewrite some things just to keep the book seeming like an antique before its time. I predicted \"extremely hot summers in the Midwest\" of nearly 110 degrees. In the summer of 2012, we've nearly already had those highs in Kansas City, which was unheard of in the late 20th Century, so to push the novel's setting a little further into the future, I had to up the ante by 10 or 15 degrees. And as for the Face on Mars, since the late 1990s, nearly all the surface of the Red Planet has been mapped in high definition. But this doesn't stop conspiracy theorists such as myself conjecturing that there still might be a cover up. (I wonder what PKD would have done if still living, as several of his novels set on the Red Planet.)As for the widespread alternative energy sources, it's beginning to appear predicting algae-derived bio-diesel and fuel-cell power cars by the mid 21st Century might have been a bit premature. I'm betting that if they aren't widely adopted in a few years, a lot of us will be on foot or bicycle, but I left them in the novel and the near future.I also owe a debt to the neurologist/author Oliver Sacks, perhaps one of the coolest intellectuals and humanists living on the planet today. As I write this preface, Dr. Sack's latest book, Hallucinations, was recently release. But in 1992, it was Sack's Awakenings that I used as a source for the alternate mental states of Shibboleth victims. In Sacks' book, the victims were of the great influenza epidemic of 1918. They had been in a frozen catatonic state for fifty years before Sacks began giving them the experimental drug L-dopa in the 1960s. Sacks documented both the human and clinical aspects of the awakening of the patients and their eventual and tragic descent back into catatonia. Some of the patients' own accounts of their experiences form the foundation for the tyranny of The Shibboleth.But enough about the nuts and bolts of science-fiction world building. I'll end this preface with another PKD quote: \"I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world we actually have does not meet my standards. Okay, so I should revise my standards; I'm out of step. I should yield to reality. I have never yielded to reality. That's what SF is all about. If you wish to yield to reality, go read Philip Roth; read the New York literary establishment mainstream bestselling writers. This is why I love SF. I love to read it; I love to write it. The SF writer sees not just possibilities but wild possibilities. It's not just 'What if'--it's 'My God; what if'--in frenzy and hysteria. The Martians are always coming.\"Robert Douglas BurnsSomewhere in East Texas", "related": ["B00FIPILTO"], "rank": 2282229, "title": "Shibboleth", "author": "R.

Gingerly Matson hates being larger than all of the other kids in her class, hates the fact that she has to buy her clothes in the women's department, and hates the nicknames that the mean kids call her, like Fattie Mattie and Matson Fatson. She tries to ignore them, tries to be invisible, but how can a 5th grader who is five feet eight inches tall be invisible? But when Gingerly meets Zoey, the new girl at school who is tiny, spirited, and not the least bit invisible, her life takes a turn for the better.\nGingerly is a sweet story about the power of friendship. Zoey is the kind of friend we all wish we had when dealing with the troubles, hurdles, and heartaches of growing up. She instantly becomes Gingerly's friend, regardless of the fact that no one else at her school had befriended Gingerly in years. Zoey looks past outward appearances and sees what's hiding inside Gingerly -- a big heart and a wounded spirit. Zoey is not only quick to befriend, but quick to defend! She stands up for Gingerly when the school bully's teasing gets out of hand. And if that isn't enough to love her, Zoey also has a knack for turning Gingerly's negative and self-deprecating thoughts into a positive, life-affirming attitude.\nGingerly is best suited for children ages 4-8. The story is simple and nonthreatening with happy endings for everyone, including the school bully.", "related": [], "rank": 3146578, "title": "Gingerly", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Schuldt encourages writers to read each other’s stories and provide helpful feedback. Short stories are usually due on the 25th of each month. Voting is available during the last five or six days of the month. Winners are announced on the 1st day of the month.

There are also pictures and other reference material.A Great ResourceAfter watching the movie \"Freedom Writers\" I became interested in Anne Frank's story - much more so than in high school, when I read \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" I am even more interested at this point, since I am planning a trip to Amsterdam. I downloaded this ebook to get a preview of the museum and was pleasantly surprised.  [...]  This short ebook packs in all the information a potential visitor needs to maximize a tour of museum.

He told me about a kid in the school who began dating a girl and as their relationship developed over a few weeks she became more and more obsessive with him. On my way home I began thinking about what would make a teenage girl act the way my son describe her and I figured it had to be something extremely harsh, like abuse,sexual abuse,or/incest.After doing a lot of research I found a a \"syndrome\" which I thought would fit and build on for  the next two books, and it is called Hebephelia.It's a little knows sexual deviation and is often mistaken for pedophilia, which it's not. A Hebephile focuses in on early to late teens, usually 12 to 16 in age. It's not classified as a mental illness like pedophilia. According to some studies men have their genes coded to look for girls within this age group and some women too. In the sequels I outline the idea behind it,but to give you an idea,it's about us,humans and trying to survive during the time we lived in caves. A girl becomes a woman and can add too the tribe a new born baby at the age of 12 for example, a woman of 30 would have been considered old. This is still in our genes, and the explanation to why a lot of men look, like, and actively seduce young teen age girls, even though our morals, ethics and laws says it's wrong.I simply exchanged the male for a female in these books.", "related": [], "rank": 3296650, "title": "Behind Her Eyes (John Book 1)", "author": "RB Schalin", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of my reading time is spent in blogs or technical publications. This read was a breath of fresh air and once available will be sent on to many close friends. I could quote pretty much every lesson in this book as very valuable but a couple really hit home:9 Create a positive atmosphere.21 Go for it.42 Learn to write a short letter.We spend a lot of time running at 100mph and sometimes you need to regroup and take a look at whats important in life. This book for me spells it out beautifully.Congratulations and best of luck with the publication.Gary Evans, Chief Technical Officer, EMC IrelandThis is one of the most important books you will ever read! It is full of simple, yet profound, messages for every person and especially for leaders and managers in the private, public and voluntary sectors.Learning and using the 50 lessons are sure ways to live life to the full in every situation, alone or in interaction with others. Each lesson can be read in about one minute, but the content has taken the author years of experience to distil and displays a style of communications that is a pleasure to read and powerful in impact.This should be a well-thumbed and much consulted reference book and source of encouragement for everyone!Dr Con Power, Economic Affairs Director of IBEC and Director of the Institute of Technology Sligo (retired)The beauty of Tony Spollen's book is that it is born of a lifetime's experience.This is no new age lifestyle guru simply dishing up his latest publication.

The key strength of the book is its conciseness. I like its ability to get to the point so efficiently which I have no doubt will appeal to our very busy world.Pat Moran, Partner, EMEIA Financial Services, Ernst & YoungJust finished your book and really enjoyed it. It has a refreshing honesty that gets to the point quickly. It is both the most simple and complex of books. It caused me to reflect as I read.Lessons 3, 21 and 24 had particular resonance to me. 42 professionally is a challenge I often come across! I think however each reader will find their own favourite parts of the book based on their life experience.I like the way the book has Irish notes in it but is ultimately a universal book. It could sell anywhere.We are in a fast-paced world where there is much focus on the transitory and instantaneous. This book doesn t take long to read but it makes a lasting impression. Congratulations.Tom Lyons, Journalist,Sunday Independent--Personal comments to the author--Personal comments to the authorWhat a great way to spend 90 minutes of my life!A person giving a copy of this book to another will be sharing a great and long lasting gift, lifting both the depressed and distressed as well as adding perspective to the happy and well-to-do. Every coffee-table, bedside locker and boardroom should have one.Nothing in life is truly complex, and this book confirms that: just as night follows day.

I wanted to know more and more.Some lessons seemed like common sense, but when l saw it before me in print, the reality dawned on me that anything is possible, and practically any situation can be overcome. I know l have a better outlook on life after reading Tony s book, and look and deal with situations that arise in my everyday life in a totally different way. Tony s personal experiences in life shine through in this book, and his honesty is palpable.Aileen Lawlor, President, The Camogie Association--Personal comments to the author", "related": ["B00D48BVJO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is well-structured and easy to read and helps you understand the fundamental building blocks that you need to make children aware of, so they can correctly construct their own understanding of numbers. I thought I knew quite a bit about maths but this book helped me realize why some of my children are struggling with doing simple word problems.

In it he celebrates the transformative spirit of Meiji Japan and examines Japan’s unexpected victory in the Russo-Japanese War, providing a thoughtful and thought-provoking perspective on those dramatic times and the people at their center. This distinguished translation of a modern classic is a landmark event.\" -Donald Keene, University Professor Emeritus, Columbia University, USA.\"Shiba Ryōtarō wrote that from the Meiji Restoration of 1868 through the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Japan transformed its premodern \"brown sugar\" society into a modern \"white sugar\" one, eagerly scooping up crystals of the new substance in the drive to create society anew. During the Pacific War, by contrast, the nation’s leaders merely went through empty motions, and Japan collapsed. This book looks back on that earlier era through the lens of the later tragedy, depicting the struggles and growth to maturity of Japan’s young men.\" -Tanaka Naoki, former Member of the Japanese Parliament and President of the Center for International Public Policy Studies, Japan.\"When the Russo-Japanese War was over and Japan had won, the commanding generals from both sides came together face to face at Suishiying. They paid honor to each other’s bravery and expressed mutual condolences, and before parting they shook hands. I have visited that very place, which seems to me less the site of a Japanese victory than a monument to the souls of fallen soldiers on both sides. I have no doubt thatClouds above the Hillswas also written to honor those souls.\" -Anno Mitsumasa, author and illustrator of children’s books in Japan.\"Quite simply, this is an incredible read that succeeds on all levels. I'm not a huge fan of history, but Ryotaro's telling of it flows beautifully, such that sometimes I forgot I was reading anything other than a work of fiction. At the same time, the sheer level of detail matches anything Tom Clancy has written, but without getting bogged down in too much technical detail the way Clancy's work often can. It also never loses sight of the human aspect of events, either at home in Japan, or overseas fighting or preparing for war... I found myself at a loss returning to the real world. This may be a book published in several volumes, but I defy anyone to read just one.\"- Iain Wear, The Bookbag, January 2013.", "related": [], "rank": 971338, "title": "Clouds above the Hill", "author": "Shiba Rytar", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book fills this gap by addressing some of the most challenging issues facing any financial engineer. It shows how sophisticated mathematics and modern statistical techniques can be used in concrete financial problems.Concerns of risk management are addressed by the control of extreme values, the fitting of distributions with heavy tails, the computation of values at risk (VaR), and other measures of risk. Data description techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), smoothing, and regression are applied to the construction of yield and forward curve. Nonparametric estimation and nonlinear filtering are used for option pricing and earnings prediction.The book is intended for undergraduate students majoring in financial engineering, or graduate students in a Master in finance or MBA program. Because it was designed as a teaching vehicle, it is sprinkled with practical examples using market data, and each chapter ends with exercises. Practical examples are solved in the computing environment of R. They illustrate problems occurring in the commodity and energy markets, the fixed income markets as well as the equity markets, and even some new emerging markets like the weather markets.The book can help quantitative analysts by guiding them through the details of statistical model estimation and implementation. It will also be of interest to researchers wishing to manipulate financial data, implement abstract concepts, and test mathematical theories, especially by addressing practical issues that are often neglected in the presentation of the theory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wondered how it would feel to write from this first-person perspective. At the same time I wanted to create a novel set in Tudor times, an era when irrevocable social and religious changes were sweeping across Europe.  Swordsman was the result.

Dr. Rodin is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and earned her PhD in Psychology from Columbia University.

For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation’s mission has been to promote the well-being of humanity throughout the world. Today, the Rockefeller Foundation pursues this mission through dual goals: advancing inclusive economies that expand opportunities for more broadly shared prosperity, and building resilience by helping people, communities, and institutions prepare for, withstand, and emerge stronger from acute shocks and chronic stresses. To achieve these goals, the Rockefeller Foundation works at the intersection of four focus areas (advance health, revalue ecosystems, secure livelihoods, and transform cities) to address the root causes of emerging challenges and create systemic change. Together with partners and grantees, the Rockefeller Foundation strives to catalyze and scale transformative innovations, create unlikely partnerships that span sectors, and take risks others cannot—or will not.
