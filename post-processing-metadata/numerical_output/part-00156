Darci prompted Kerry consideringly, as she threw open the door to her wardrobe and brought out a white dress. 'The demure virgin?'She held the garment against her, its plain styling covering her tall slenderness from neck to knee. She pulled her heavy length of red hair away from the delicate lines of her heart-shaped face, at the same time lowering her head, her expression youthfully coy as she looked at Kerry with moss-green eyes through long dark lashes.Her flatmate and long-term friend laughed softly as she sat on the bed, watching the display. 'Or…?' Kerry queried smilingly.'Or sexy vamp?' Darci threw the white dress down on the bed and pulled out a slinky black gown, its ribbon shoulder straps, low neckline, body-hugging style and length—three inches above the knee—leaving very little to the imagination as she held it against her, releasing her hair to fluff its long, fiery length enticingly about her face and shoulders as she adopted a deliberately seductive pose.'Hmm.' Kerry grimaced. 'Somewhere in between the two, I think. Grant once told me that every man's perfect fantasy woman is one who's as beautiful and charming as an angel in public and as sexy as a she-devil in his bed!'Darci's brows rose. 'My big brother told you that?''Years ago, at university.' Kerry, a tiny brunette, laughed at Darci's surprised expression. 'I think we had all just come home from a party at the time, and he was bemoaning the fact that he doubted he was ever going to meet his perfect woman.''Well, he was right about that, anyway; at twenty-eight he's still a bachelor. In fact, just like me, there isn't a permanent relationship in sight,' Darci added with a slight frown. 'If there was, he wouldn't have asked me to accompany him to his latest film premiere!'Exactly five minutes older than Darci, her twin brother was an extremely successful film director. He had scaled the heady heights to superstardom during the last four years, his last two films having been box office hits. Grant was hoping to add to his current run of success with the premiere of his latest film the following evening. A premiere where, as the producer of the film, Luc Gambrelli was also going to be in attendance.A delicious coincidence too convenient to resist as far as Darci was concerned…She looked at the two dresses critically. 'So, somewhere in between, you think…? Of course it would probably help if I knew whether Luc Gambrelli preferred redheads to brunettes or blondes.''Depends on the day of the week, I expect,'Kerry dismissed sagely. 'Monday a blonde. Tuesday a brunette. Wednesday a redhead. Et cetera. From the gossip about him in the newspapers over the years, he appears to have a different woman for each day of the week,' she explained, at Darci's puzzled look.Darci pondered her friend's words. 'Then we can only hope that it's redheads on a Thursday evening!'Her friend gave her a rueful smile. 'You really intend going through with this…?''And hopefully giving Luc Gambrelli a taste of his own heartless medicine?' Darci said distractedly, as she began another search through her wardrobe for the perfect dress to wear tomorrow evening. 'He broke Mellie's heart, remember. Of course I'm going to get Grant to introduce the two of us at the premiere in the hope of attracting his attention—and then I shall have the pleasure of giving him one almighty set-down if he does show any interest. It's about time some woman let the arrogant Luc Gambrelli know that every female he meets isn't going to swoon at his feet!' she added with determination.'Isn't being rude to someone as powerful as film producer Luc Gambrelli possibly going to have fall-out and damage Grant's career?' Kerry responded.'That's the best part.' Darci grinned. 'My big brother is so much the golden boy movie director at the moment that he simply can't be touched!'Kerry still looked worried. 'Yet from what I've read, the film world is a precarious one; someone can be the darling of the moment one minute and a total outcast the next!''Do you really think Luc Gambrelli would be petty enough to take his disappointment out on Grant?' Darci said disbelievingly.'He might,' Kerry returned.Darci laughed as she bent down to hug the other woman. 'You always were the worrier amongst us!' she told Kerry affectionately, knowing that if it weren't for her friend's caution in earlier years she would have got into many more scrapes than she had, her own nature—part of being a redhead, perhaps?—having been much more impetuous.And Darci had no intention of backing off from Luc Gambrelli. Not after what he had done to Mellie…'You do realise that Luc Gambrelli will probably be with someone tomorrow evening…?' Kerry persisted.'That's where you're wrong,' Darci announced with satisfaction. 'Grant told me that Luc Gambrelli is escorting the female lead, Jackie Tunbridge. She's new to all this, and a little nervous, and apparently Luc Gambrelli has been a little more circumspect in who he takes where recently.'She paused to consider for a moment, then continued, 'Grant says it's because he doesn't want to get caught in the marital trap, like his brother and his cousin. Count Wolf Gambrelli and Cesare Gambrelli,' she explained, as Kerry looked totally blank.'Luc Gambrelli is related to those two?'Kerry gasped after a few seconds.Darci nodded. 'His brother is the Count, no less,' she confirmed, still searching through her wardrobe for exactly the right dress to wear tomorrow evening. 'It's no good,' she conceded, as she turned back into the bedroom decisively. 'I'll have to go out tomorrow and look for something new.''But you hate shopping for new clothes,' her friend reminded her.Darci scowled. 'For the chance to put the oh-I-think-I'mso-wonderful Luc Gambrelli firmly in his place I'll make an exception! Kerry, I know you don't think this is a good idea,' she said, as Kerry carried on looking doubtful. 'But the man really can't be allowed to just cold-heartedly break the heart of one of my very best friends without some sort of retaliation!'Kerry, Mellie and Darci had been at school together, and then had stuck with each other while taking further education courses in London: Kerry had taken a degree in History, Mellie had gone to drama school and Darci had chosen Medicine. Grant, having known Darci's old friends well, and having attended university, too, had joined them in sharing a house during those years of studying.The passing years had forged a bond between the four of them that was as close, if not closer, than family; if one of them was hurt, the others felt it, too.And then, six weeks ago, Mellie's tender heart had been broken by the heartless Luc Gambrelli!After university Grant had gone to Los Angeles, and the three women had taken another apartment together in London. Then, six months ago, Mellie—after some mild success on the London stage—had gone to Los Angeles, too, in order to look for acting roles.Which was how she had met and fallen in love with the famous film producer Luc Gambrelli.The two had got together at a party—Luc Gambrelli apparently dazzling Mellie completely when he'd assured her that she was perfect for a part in the film he was shortly going to put into production.Kerry and Darci had followed the Italian film producer's seduction of Mellie via their friend's frequent telephone calls and e-mails, and she'd waxed lyrical about how wonderful he was, how he had swept her off her feet, pursuing her relentlessly as he showered her with flowers and gifts until his conquest was secure and Mellie was head-over-heels in love with him and more than eager to share his bed. An experience Mellie had related to her two friends in erotic detail.After which the heartless pig had just disappeared out of Mellie's life, as had the prospective part in his film, leaving her broken-hearted as she realised she had fallen for the oldest trick in the book when it came to acting—the casting couch. Or, in this case, Luc Gambrelli's silk-sheeted bed!If all Darci managed to do tomorrow evening was get Grant to introduce her to Luc Gambrelli, and then she succeeded in giving the man the knock to his super-ego that he so richly deserved, she would be happy.All without telling him that she was a friend of Mellie's, of course; it would be just too humiliating for Mellie if Luc Gambrelli were to realise she had really fallen for him in a big way.Of course an even better set-down would have been if Mellie herself had accompanied Grant to the premiere. But that would have involved telling Grant of Mellie's humiliation, and for Mellie's sake, Darci was trying to avoid doing that.'I think you're mad to go within twenty feet of all that lethal charm, darling,' Kerry told her admiringly. 'And of course, there's always the possibility that it may just backfire on you,' she added.'You mean, he really may not like redheads?' Darci replied.'This redhead?'Kerry looked at Darci consideringly before responding loyally, 'Not a chance! You're incredibly beautiful and very sexy. As proven by the amount of hearts you've left broken along the wayside in the last few years!'If Darci had, then it hadn't been deliberate. She had just been pretty single-minded about her career—to the point where relationships hadn't featured too strongly in her life, and certainly none of a permanent nature. There simply hadn't been the time for that, as well as her work.'So what did you mean about it backfiring…?' she said slowly.Kerry sighed. 'Has it ever occurred to you that once you've actually met the man, you might just find Luc Gambrelli as devastatingly irresistible as every other female on the planet has? That instead of taking delight in coldly shunning him you might just end up falling for all that Mediterranean charm yourself?' she warned wryly.'No chance,' Darci assured her with certainty.

When director Jim Simpson of off-Broadway's Flea Theatre learned about her efforts, he recognized the potential for an original play. With his encouragement, first-time playwright Nelson feverishly wrote this two-character, one-act work, showing great sensibility and compassion. Premiered at the Flea Theatre on December 4, 2001, the play has been a running success. In these finished eulogies, the fire captain's sketchy recollections of four of his men at work and at play were transformed into full portraitures. Through skillful dialogs and monologs, minimal props and setting, Nelson transcended time and space to create a moving, cathartic work. The book includes three pictures from the Flea Theatre production, a lengthy preface and afterword by the author, and a list of suggested readings. This timely literary work is highly recommended for all academic and public libraries.Ming-ming Shen Kuo, Ball State Univ.

In this way, the author develops his memoir beyond the events of August 2005 into an examination of what makes a community significant. In many ways, this post-storm memoir is certainly a study of urban destruction; although hopeful, McNulty does not shy away from the stark reality of life at the glacial pace of the reconstruction. The nuts and bolts of months without electricity and hot water make it deeply personal, but the value is found in the answer to the question of why this particular city must be rebuilt. It is, simply put, because so many people cannot imagine life anywhere else. They are the true City of New Orleans, and like McNulty, they require an infrastructure to give their hearts a home. --Colleen Mondor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A bomb explodes in a tent near a shopping center; then an opera singer is murdered. In charge of the case is ranking copper, Robert Skinner, who was introduced in Skinner's Rules and remains a tough and resourceful Scot. While steadily ratcheting up the tension, Jardine provides a lot of annual Edinburgh Festival detail-the sites and the sounds, plays and performances, all of which have to be guarded more closely as the body count grows. Skinner's daughter falls for a mystery man, and his deputy falls for a mystery woman, even as the first clue to the terrorists' identity points to an American woman roaming the country, a killer in more ways than one. Although the identity of one murderer is ludicrously easy to spot, and the too-frequent sex scenes tend to feature such lines as \"he drank deeply from the well of her passion,\" Jardine offers spectacularly effective action scenes, and Skinner, while sometimes too hard-boiled to swallow, is an admirable hero.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does. She makes no excuses for the darkness surrounding them, especially the paranormal creatures, and says that this is their world.

Blending the disciplines of anthropology and evolutionary psychology with over thirty years of experience in the diplomatic corps, Coon traces the evolution of the human tendency to divide others into two groups, \"us versus them.\"  People tend instinctively to behave altruistically toward members of their own in-group and to react with suspicion, or even hostility, toward outsiders.  He points out that complex human societies became possible only when cultural attitudes encouraged individuals to define their in-groups in more expansive ways.  Thus, small, kin-based bands grew into villages, kingdoms, and eventually, the moden nation-state.  Today, he argues, we have reached a stage where the whole world must be viewed as \"us,\" for only a united world community can cope with current global challenges.The first half of ONE PLANET, ONE PEOPLE draws on contemporary thinking about the evolution of complex human societies, from the time of our remote ancestors to the present.  The concluding portion analyzes current global problems in that evolutionary context.  Coon's main conclusion is that all of us are in a vortex of massive change, in transit from a world of largely competitive nation-states to a global system of governance superimposed on those states, and capable of addressing emerging global problems that the state system cannot solve on its own.Coon's book gives us a new framework within which to evaluate increasingly urgent global problems, such as terrorism and the global problem of refugees and migration.  This new context provides a sense of direction that is badly needed in the current turmoil over issues like Iraq.  Coon's analysis makes it clear, for example, that the unilateral policies of the Bush administration have been marching the United States in precisely the wrong direction.Coon's broad international experience, combined with an admirable ability to synthesize the latest research from anthropology and evolutionary psychology, results in many original insights and fresh ways of evaluating today's global challenges.  This is an extraordinary book that offers a crucially important message.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carolyn’s sympathetic teacher puts things in perspective, telling her that when it comes to writing, ideas and emotions are much more important than slants and curves. Designed to encourage children, books in the Adventures of Everyday Geniuses series tell stories of students who struggle in some respects, while excelling in others. Bright with colorful washes, the cartoonlike drawings clearly express the characters’ emotions. Given the pressure to introduce cursive writing to younger students, this picture book will resonate with a growing number of children.

Actually, he might have better titled his study Why Americans Hate Certain Kinds of Welfare, because he convincingly shows that most Americans actually support state assistance to the deserving poor, i.e., those who are not lazy and who actively seek employment. On the other hand, Americans overwhelmingly oppose welfare to those perceived as shiftless. This category has come to be associated with African Americans, partly through the medias long-term tendency to connect welfare with blacks. To prove this point, the book analyzes more than four decades of news reports on poverty. In the end, the author shows how racial stereotypes, not white self-interest or anti-statism, lie at the root of opposition to welfare programs.

Through these diverse experiences grew the foundation of who she is, how she would grow and who she would become. Ms. Fields was raised Roman Catholic and began branching out and learning about other faiths and creeds, in her last two years at Barry University in Miami, Florida.  It was there that her true study of religion and its ramifications to our society as a whole began.  She studied the psychology, sociology and anthropology of religion.  It is within this environment that she realized that the confinement of a single religious doctrine was definitely not for her. Ms. Fields continued her personal studies and it was here that she broadened her vision and expanded her horizons from the confinement of religious doctrine and embraced the total expansiveness of spirituality.  To her, the doorways were opened and along that path she became aware she was clairvoyant, clairaudient and clairsentient. Ms. Fields lives in Scottsdale, Arizona with her husband Vincent DiClemente, where she pursues her career and her calling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The problem was, whenever I asked a question, I usually got one of two pat answers.  \"You have to have faith\" or \"Because the bible says so\".  For most people, I guess that was a good enough answer; however, for me it was simply not answering the question at all.  So, as I got older, and still there were no answers, I decided to find the answers myself.  It didn't take long to figure out that I was asking the questions the church didn't want people to ask.  It's one thing to have faith; however, as the people of Jonestown found out, having blind faith can be a bad thing.  I finally decided to write a book, so that other people who had questions might be able to find answers too.  One of my friends, who is a devout catholic read my book.  She said she didn't agree with my book; however, she said she enjoyed it, and that it made her think.

Much of the story has to do with the precarious balance of power between the two. Christine has a moral hold over the Phantom, but she doesn't take it upon herself to absolve him, to reform him in any absolute sense, or to sacrifice herself to him. He remains a monster, and not always a sympathetic one. Their passion is based on this tension, and of course it's one that can't endure indefinitely, as Christine knows. The moral and psychological complexity of this story can't be easily summarized. Think of it as an antidote to the fable of the evil man redeemed by the love of a good woman, but don't stop there; it's many other things as well. --Justine LarbalestierA fascinating exploration of domesticity and power and literary roles. Even though she's the heroine of a romance, Christine is no fainting, yielding, pliable victim. She's a hard-headed business woman who knows how to negotiate with managers and directors and monsters, too. Erik, on the other hand, is governed completely by his passions. In most Romances, the heroine must teach the hero to feel and to express his feelings. In \"Beauty,\" it's the other way around. --Delia Sherman\"Boobs\":\"Boobs\" is a gem, if one can thus describe a tale so repulsive. --Mary Scott,The Listener, May 1990\"Boobs\" (is) a riotous and truly gruesome re-writing of the (werewolf) myth from a female angle. --Julie Bertagna,Scotland on Sunday, May 27, 1990\"The Unicorn Tapestry\" . . . uses the vampire legend to speculate ingeniously on the nature of psychotherapy and female sexuality. --Steven Lehman,Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review, Jan/Feb 1983Awards\"The Unicorn Tapestry\": Nebula Award, Best Novella, 1980\"Boobs\": Hugo", "related": [], "rank": 1908065, "title": "Music of the Night", "author": "Suzy McKee Charnas", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Holland’s writing is spare, gripping, and unexpectedly flares like the burning of Vietnamese paper money, as the book describes, for the ghosts of the unloved dead. Here is humour, menace and beauty effortlessly combined in a novel of genuine power. Holland is, quite simply, one of the best prose stylists working in Australia today.\"—Matthew Condon\"Tense, troubling and beautifully rendered, this remarkable novel proves that the darkest little room is indeed the human heart. Patrick Holland has joined the ranks of the adventurer novelists and enhanced his growing reputation.\"—Michael Robotham\"In these tumultuous times for publishing, the focus is often on extremely well-established authors or new ones, so it is gratifying to see a select few Australian fiction writers maturing through their second, third and fourth novels. Holland is one of these, and The Darkest Little Room might prove to be a watershed moment in his career. The short 38 chapters are well weighted and cinematic, lending the narrative a relentless pace. The dialogue is tough and curt, the descriptions often achingly beautiful. There are elements of mystery and otherworldliness woven throughout this exciting story but also a sense of gravitas, that what Holland is examining here is important - the appalling treatment of women as sex slaves in Asia and the Western man's complicity in this sordid business. In many ways,The Darkest Little Roomis the perfect 21st-century Australian novel, exposing the cruel underbelly of life in the Asia-Pacific region while also managing to be a cracking read.\"—Chris Flynn, The Age and Sydney Morning Herald\"Patrick Holland will be one of Australia’s greatest writers of the future. I can’t say you heard it here first because everyone is saying it.\"—Krissy Kneen, Sunday Mai\"I readThe Darkest Little Roomin an enjoyable kind of panic, because by the time I got to page 20, I knew I had to read it in one day or I would have a sleepless night. It is unputdownable ... Which of his other friends can be trusted? Joe’s fellow-blackmailer and private investigator Minh Quy, or the Chinese pseudo art-dealer Zhuan with contacts in strange places? Can the reader trust Joe himself when we see where the trajectory of his world-weary cynicism and his vulnerability to love leads him? He can still be shocked by acquiescence to evil, but like any of Graham Greene’s characters, he has a moral decline of his own to confront ... This is a wonderful book, destined for the shortlists.\"—Lisa Hill, ANZ Lit Lovers\"A dark and totally original take on one of the standard plots of crime fiction set in Asia: foreigner-falls-for-bargirl-who-ends-up-much-more-than-she-seems. So… Joseph is an Australian journalist living in Saigon with a sideline in blackmailing high profile philanderers who he photographs in compromising situations in brothels. One day a foreign businessman approaches him with a picture of a physically abused but beautiful woman held prisoner in a brothel known as ‘the darkest little room’. Before long, Joseph has rescued the woman, who is mysteriously free of any physical wounds, and fallen in love, only to have her snatched back again by the gang of traffickers who bought her to Vietnam. Wonderfully drawn characters, acute and often painful observations about the expatriate condition, a vivid depiction of Vietnam, and a break neck plot make this a mesmerizing read.\"—Andrew Nette, Pulp Curry\"The Darkest Little Roomis my first experience with the prose of Aussie author Patrick Holland. His writing has a visceral, uncensored quality – it is as if the reader has been transported to Saigon and can smell the odors in the seedy back alleys; or feel the rain running down their face in the dense jungle ...The Darkest Little Room... is as gripping and thrilling as it is effortlessly artistic and lyrical. Many titles these days are billed as literary thrillers but this one truly fits that description. There is a poetic quality to both the tale and its telling. As foreshadowed by the book cover art, the imagery within is stark and powerful ...This is a story that lingers long after its conclusion.\"—BOOK RATING: The Story 4/5; The Writing 5/5, Booklover Book Reviews\"There is a directness and spareness to the prose that beautifully balances out the action and the more traditional elements of the plot, and the slow, meditative tension easily calls to mind the dark romance of Greene’s The Quiet American. Yet apart from pure mystery, it seems to me that this is a novel very much about what it means to be enamoured with a place you can never truly understand, to be a stranger in a city where you feel yourself to be most bound.\"—Jessica Au, ReadingsPRAISE FORRIDING THE TRAINS IN JAPAN: TRAVELS IN THE SACRED AND SUPERMODERN EAST:Shortlisted for the 2012 Queensland Literary Awards, Best NonfictionShortlisted for the 2012 Courier Mail People's Choice Award\"Riding the Trains in Japansucceeds in the difficult task of offering the reader a fresh vision of places and histories, of catching the impression of distant voices and also of offering the kind of insight only acquired through travelling.\"—The AustralianPRAISE FORTHE SOURCE OF THE SOUND:Winner of the 2010 Walter Scott PriceShortlisted for the 2011 Steele Rudd Prize\"Beautiful and bittersweet ... written in tough lean prose, its denouement leaves a lingering impression.\"—Sydney Morning HeraldPRAISE FORTHE LONG ROAD OF THE JUNKMAILER:Shortlisted for the 2006 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best First BookWinner of the 2005 Queensland Premier's Award, Best Emerging Author\"A quite brilliant debut.\"—The Australian\"His imagination is unrivaled.\"—Good Reading Magazine\"Quirky, magical, melancholic and utterly readable.\"—Bookseller + Publisher", "related": ["B00GCSJG9A"], "rank": 2395063, "title": "The Mary Smokes Boys", "author": "Patrick Holland", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead, he finds an about-to-be-murdered young gay cop named Mark Forrest, lured there by the same tipster/killer. So begins the investigation in this fourth Mills book from Zimmerman, one of the best of the current crop of writers of gay-themed mysteries. As in his previous Mills outings (Hostage,Closet,Tribe), Zimmerman shows us an often deadly urban world freighted with sexual tension. This time, involved in the police investigation is Todd's lover, Steve Rawlins, recently diagnosed as HIV positive--a fact that adds darkness to an already grim story. Rawlins becomes a target for the killer who has a grudge against gays and cops, the roots of which we begin to learn about gradually and with several sideways moves. Zimmerman creates a landscape perhaps a bit too dominated by variations on gay sexuality to be totally believable. But after decades of mysteries featuring nothing but straight sex, a little reverse imbalance isn't that hard to bear.--Dick Adler", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 1082620, "title": "Outburst (A Todd Mills Mystery)", "author": "R.D.

I’m truly just a humble, genuine man with more questions than answers.  I do suppose though, to quote the books that, “Life has its reasons…” I think, and it is deeply related throughout the entire series, that there is more going on than what we know. We all came from somewhere, and the flow of Time is apparently taking us somewhere. Where is that? I don’t know, exactly. But, I do believe the following: We (all those science guys, actually) have discovered that everything is made of energy and lives in a universe of the extremely BIG: quadrillion, trillion, gazillion Stars, Galaxies, Clusters, Nebulae, Black Holes, etc., which exist in an envelope of space that is not only apparently growing, but accelerating in its expansion. We have also discovered a universe of the small, which, in and of itself, appears to contain just as many sub-components as the big universe has large ones. And we, mysteriously, have found ourselves smack in the middle, looking up, and looking down, consciously considering it all as we scratch our little heads asking: Why? The Amazing part…is that we learned all of this through our little three-and-a-half-pound brains. Wow! How’d we do that? Which has led me to think that…there’s more to us than just these little three-and-a-half-pound brains.  -------------- < O > --------------- (G. F.

As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person. Currently, he has more than twenty books written, most of which are available worldwide as e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Google, Kobo, and Apple.", "related": [], "rank": 1143181, "title": "Ego", "author": "Kevin Everett FitzMaurice", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her heart quaked as much as her hand. She'd only worked in one place her entire life, and it was right here in this century-old, brick-walled storefront.\"'One cannot look into a bright future if her eyes are filled with tears from the past,'\" she quoted aloud, pressing the quivering ballpoint to the signature line, but her fingers refused to move.Spouting insights was easy. One of the signs in her window read \"Haircuts—$10. Wisdom—priceless.\" Her grandfather Max had started the custom of sharing philosophical quotes with his customers over fifty years ago. When he'd passed Honey Comb's to Gabby, she'd gladly picked up the torch. She must have had hundreds of quotes packed into her brain by now. But talk was cheap unless action backed it up. Action—that was the hard part.\"Life is like crossing a set of monkey bars. You have to let go to move forward.\" She muttered one of her grandfather's favorite sayings, and taking one big deep breath, scrawled her name.Wide-eyed and perspiring, she looked at the page. \"Oh, my God, I'm really doing it.\"Unexpectedly, a chunk of anxiety fell away like rusted armor. Refusing to give herself time to chicken out, she quickly penned the date then signed on the other lines the real-estate agent had indicated.For as long as Gabby could remember, she had planned to do two things with her life: Run Honey Comb's—the coziest, warmest place on earth, and marry Dean Kings-ley—the coziest, warmestmanon the planet.\"'The best laid schemes of mice and men do often go awry….'\"Despite the fact that Dean had never been anything other than friendly and kind, Gabby had convinced herself that he would fall for her when she was thinner, prettier, funnier. When she figured out how to keep her red hair from frizzing in the summer, or when she'd read all his favorite books. His love was going to be the chrysalis that changed her from plain, awkward Gabby Coombs to confident, graceful butterfly.Dean had screwed up her great plan by falling in love with someone else. Someone who had been a stranger to all of them until only a few months ago. Now the man she'd dreamed about for twenty years (twenty—aaaaaagh!)was married with a child on the way, and Gabby felt like an old train that had rattled too long on the same dusty route, never veering from its chosen course but expecting the scenery magically to change.Well, not anymore.\"It's time for me to say goodbye, Poppy.\" She lifted her gaze to the framed black-and-white photo of the man who had given her this barbershop on her twenty-third birthday, nearly one decade ago. Despite her firm conviction (it really was firm), tears filled her eyes. \"I hope you understand.\"Her benevolent grandfather smiled down at her, leaning against the striped barber pole that, to this day, swirled like a dancing peppermint stick out front.Six weeks earlier, on a whim, Gabby had applied for a job that would take her far from her hometown of Hon-eyford, Oregon. Three days ago she'd received an offer of employment from Rising Sun Cruises. The next morning she'd accepted the offer, and yesterday she had visited the real-estate agent to put her business up for sale.Bold moves, every one, which was exactly what she needed right now. Bold moves to create a brand new life.And a brand new Gabby.When a knock rattled the barbershop's glass door, she realized she was several minutes past opening, something she couldn't recall ever happening before. Jumping from her stool behind the small front desk, she headed for the door.Wiping the moisture from beneath her eyes, she smoothed a hand over the kinky hair that inevitably escaped her ponytail and turned the key in the lock. She plastered a smile on her face as she swung the door open, but words of welcome died on her lips. Surprise—and the stirrings of something that felt like dread—tensed every muscle.June sunshine silhouetted a tall man with square shoulders. As Gabby's eyes adjusted to the light, she saw that he was gorgeous—stillgorgeous—in a way few males in Honeyford were. An edgy, mysterious, dangerous kind of gorgeous.\"Hi, there. Can I get a haircut?\"The lump of emotion filling Gabby's throat all morning doubled at the sound of his voice, which was deeper, more gravelly than it had been fifteen years earlier when Caleb Wells had been an eighteen-year-old farmhand bound and determined to make something of himself.Her gaze rose to his chestnut hair. Thick, wavy and glittering with deep bronze-and-gold highlights, it had obviously been expertly styled.\"You don't need a haircut,\" she said, her voice hoarse with shock. \"You look.\" She hesitated.As a teen, Cal had been whipcord lean, perpetually hungry looking. Now in his thirties, he impressively filled his designer suit. As sharp as three points of a triangle, the chin and jaw that used to sport a light shadow were smooth and whisker-free.\"You look good,\" she concluded, feeling her face flame.The right side of his mouth curled just a bit in response.He turned his head, glancing into the barbershop. \"May I come in?\"Gabby hesitated, apprehension tingling throughout her body.One of the signs in her window warned, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, You Better Get Your Hair Cut Someplace Else,\" but Cal looked more like the CEO of a Fortune 1000 company than a small-town kid who'd once struggled by on odd jobs and church handouts. Since she couldn't justify keeping him out, Gabby stepped back and got a whiff of expensive cologne as Cal brushed past her. Whatever he'd been doing all these years, he'd managed to effect a complete transformation.How ironic,she thought dazedly, feeling as if she were having an out-of-body experience,that Cal Wells, of all people, should reappear again now, when I'm about to take the biggest risk of my life.A decade and a half ago,hehad been the biggest risk she'd ever taken. And that time she had concluded she'd made an awful mistake.As Cal entered the barbershop, his gaze moved to the wall of black-and-white pictures that framed the large mirrors above Honey Comb's two cutting stations. The photos, most of which she'd taken, were the only things that changed in the shop on a regular basis.While Cal moved closer, studying her work, Gabby busied herself opening the blinds and flipping the sign that said, \"Shut Till We're Not,\" to the side that announced, \"Come In Already.\"Several times she glanced over her shoulder, until Cal caught her gaze in the mirror and raised a brow.\"Your photos?\" he asked, indicating the display.She nodded.Again he gave her that flicker of a smile. \"You're good. I knew you would be.\"Her heart stuttered a little in response. \"Thanks.\" How many times had she taken photos of him while he'd worked on her family's farm? Hidden from view, she'd snapped candid shots, using the rough and beautiful Oregon landscape as the perfect backdrop for Cal's untamed looks and solitary personality. Her family had praised the many photos she took of them all, but only Cal had truly studied her work, commenting on the light and the composition. Telling her that her work showed \"passion.\"\"So how about that haircut?\"Slowly she shook her head. \"You don't need it.\"Still looking at her in the mirror, he ran a hand over the thick waves. \"I do. It's too long.\"Because his hair was trimmed neatly above his ears, the comment surprised her. \"It's shorter than I've ever seen it. It was way past your shoulders the last time—\" With the nature of their last encounter—and its aftermath—filling her mind, Gabby fumbled. \"—the last time I saw you.\"Cal turned toward her, pinning her with the unwavering hazel gaze that had always hidden more than it revealed. \"I haven't tried to wear my hair like a rock star for years, Gabrielle. It's time for a trim. And you were always the best.\" When she continued to stare without speaking, he pressed, \"It wouldn't make you uncomfortable, would it? Now that I think about it, cutting my hair used to make you pretty damn nervous.\"\"No, it didn't.\" Automatic and defensive, her denial made Cal grin.A real grin, not the partial, inscrutable smile characteristic of him. This one was full and beautiful, which was strange since the boy Gabby had known came from a home life that hadn't offered up many reasons to smile. She felt slightly woozy now, trying to remember when she'd last seen unreserved enjoyment on his face. Then he said, \"You haven't changed, Gabby,\" and her stomach plunked to her feet.\"I resent that.\"The brow arched higher. \"Why?\"\"Why?\" Because fifteen years ago she had looked like little Orphan Annie on steroids, and he damn well knew it!Since Cal had left town, she'd shaved off twenty pounds and had grown out the curly hair she used to control by keeping it shaped like a spongy football helmet around her head. Sadly, she was missing a fashion chromosome, so her wardrobe had transformed only to the extent that she now bought smaller size jeans and tucked in the blouses she wore to work. Still, she had made a true attempt this past decade and a half to look better, and it was beyond frus...", "related": ["B004U73C9U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you want a feel for the inner life of a therapist; for inner life, period; read this book. There is something magical at work here.

It goes right to the heart of everything and makes you believe in truth.”“Wisdom and humility are rare virtues, perhaps especially among people as smart as Michael Eigen. But this second volume documenting Eigen’s seminars on psychoanalysis in Seoul, Korea, exemplifies both. Whether he is interpreting Bion, reflecting on madness, commenting on psychoanalytic history, describing patients, or contemplating the value of not knowing, the depth of his compassionate, unpretentious knowledge touches us. To sit in on this remarkable seminar is a balm to the heart.”“Eigen has a rare common touch about uncommon matters, and the reverse. I can only imagine the joy Bion – and Winnicott – would have had if they had been able to converse with him. Utmostly, Eigen is the spokesman for humility, the sacred, intuition, and respect for differences. Eigen is sometime so lyrical in his prose that one may think he is speaking blank verse: ‘We have so many languages for cries from the heart. Each adds a variety, a nuance, a particular soul window.’ When I finished reading this work, I not only realized how much I had learned, I also felt more centred.

Roger would rather have one reader that is totally satisfied with his works than millions who view those novels as being so-so.Remembering his school days, Roger trudged through one boring story after another not because he wanted to, but because it was required reading. After enduring those unpleasant tasks, he is determined to avoid placing his readers in a similar situation. A driving force to fulfill this dream is evident in his many novels.Equipped with a unique talent, Roger watches the story play out in his mind like a movie. His life-long experiences, along with his compassion for mankind, have provided him with the tools needed to create stories that are adventurous, thrilling, passionate, suspenseful, and entertaining.The motivating factor behind Roger s writings is to entertain his readers. His motto is simple. I want my readers to be eager to continue the story, long for the ending, and when the experience is over be happy they took the time to read my book. After all, reading can and should be enjoyable.Thank you for taking the time to consider the many novels of Roger D.

She moved to North Carolina to study at Barton College, where she received a bachelor of fine arts degree. Her first job took her to the coastal town of Elizabeth City, where she worked for the North Carolina Arts Council as a resident artist. While there, the surrounding beauty of the rural farms and ocean scenery took root in her heart, and her lifelong love affair with nature flourished. Later, during her seventeen years as a graphic designer in central North Carolina, she kept her connection to the environment alive. Perhaps the greatest contribution to this has been her choice of residence in a beautiful natural area, covered in a green canopy of forests and bordering a scenic river. Shirley has always had a love for art and adventure, and that has inspired her to do such things as travel in Europe alone, land in a small plane on the top of an Alaskan glacier, sing in an a cappella group, and begin horseback riding lessons in her late fifties. She now works as a fine artist, exploring the role nature plays in our lives. She lives with her husband near Chapel Hill and is a mother and a grandmother.", "related": [], "rank": 3970351, "title": "The Animal Seeker", "author": "Shirley Galbrecht", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Considered at first an enfant terrible on the fringe and then a disquieting superego to the analytic establishment and to most practicing psychotherapists, he finally has come to enjoy a noteworthy acceptance and credibility for his then revolutionary ideas.Perhaps the following would suffice to give the briefest idea of the thrust of his ideas: beginning with the concept of the bipersonal field and culminating in the evolution of \"communicative psychotherapy\" and now \"empowered psychotherapy\" through \"self-processing\", there runs a red thread of continuity through the various evolutions that have characterized Langs' thinking. I believe that this red thread is that of a pragmatic idealist who has been attempting to reinstitution such ideas as truth, ethics, humility and ontological security in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.In fact, Langs seems to believe that the frame psychology is the essence of treatment! Even if the reader is skeptical, he/she will come away from reading this book with an enhanced realization of the importance of his/her frame awareness. I certainly have.From the Foreword by James S. Grotstein, M.D.The self-processing (self-analysis) therapy that is at the heart of this book is arguably the most powerful means available for accessing and harnessing the power and wisdom of a deep intelligence whose adaptive choices and encoded communications embody a compelling and effective route to insight and cure. Langs' attention to the details of technique and to the ground rules and of the treatment situation generates many surprising perspectives on the therapeutic experience, exciting revelations that have a multitude of applications in clinical practice. Empowered Psychotherapy is a modern-day classic that stands on the cutting edge of psychotherapy; the book is a turning point in the long and honorable history of the fields of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.", "related": [], "rank": 3453210, "title": "Empowered Psychotherapy: Teaching Self-Processing", "author": "Robert Langs", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After devoting seven years of his life to this vital work, \"Born for a Purpose\" was completed in the year 1994.Todd was an extremely gifted writer as well as a talented musician. After the completion of \"Born for a Purpose,\" he went on to compose and record, with his wife, an album of original contemporary Christian music titled \"Scarlett's Love Songs.\" He also compiled a cookbook, \"101 Amish Recipes.\" Two works were in progress at the time of his death.

The first time I saw it was\na sunny morning in Estoril filling the entire window display of one of the\nbookshops that handled foreign books. It was a complete surprise to gaze at my\noffspring, dozens of them in their orange covers. For the next few weeks I was\nhappily busy signing autographs. A\nneighbor of ours, an American from California,\nrang our doorbell. 'I loved this book, the kid, the French ambiance ... It would make a great film and I think I could\nhelp you'. Well, he could and he did. Walt Disney Productions took an option on\n'The Pope, My Brother and I' as Maurice Chevalier owed them a film. 'No way', said\nmy widowed mother, offended: 'Maurice Chevalier is too crude to be my husband'.\nMy neighbor visited Walt Disney in California\nshortly before he died, and on that day every film option of the Walt Disney\nStudios was dropped. It was\nyears since I opened and really studied my book again, though I knew it was in\ndemand because for an eye-popping price I'd arranged fifteen Xeroxed copies for\nfriends - one of them going as far as Monaco. Perhaps a little flutter of\nvanity, but it became obvious to me that forty-five years later the book has\nkept its charm and warmth. Today's readers seem more interested than ever to\nlearn about French family life of those years through the eyes of a 12 year-old\nchild.", "related": [], "rank": 2345081, "title": "The Pope, My Brother and I - Recollections of a French Childhood eBook", "author": "Penny Howson", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1930, he began work as an electrician in a Moscow suburb. In 1934, he joined the design bureau of Viktor Bolkhovitinov, a noted designer of bombers. In 1946, Chertok joined the newly established NII-88 institute as head of the control systems department and worked hand-in-hand with legendary Chief Designer Sergey Korolev.  Chertok became one of Korolev’s closest aides in developing control systems for ballistic missiles and spacecraft, eventually becoming deputy chief designer of the famous OKB-1, the design organization that spun off from NII-88 in 1956. Chertok participated in every major project at OKB-1 (now the Energiya Rocket-Space Corporation, RKK Energiya) until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when he retired from active work. Academician Chertok currently lives in Moscow and serves as the Chief Scientific Consultant to RKK Energiya.  His four-volume memoirs “Rekety I lyudi” (Rockets and People) were published in Moscow between 1994 and 1999. Asif A. Siddiqi is an Assistant Professor of history at Fordham University in New York. In 2008–2009 he was a visiting Fellow at the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Dr. Siddiqi is the author of a number of books on the history of space flight including “Challenge to Apollo: the Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945-1974” (NASA, 2000) and the “Red Rockets’ Glare:  Soviet Imaginations and the Birth of Sputnik”¬¬¬¬ (Cambridge University Press, 2099)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A foundling discovered in a Brazilian river by a professor doing field research, he is the last of his tribe, the Xique Xique having been wiped out to make way for a rubber plantation. Charlie is raised by Professor and Mrs. Duckworth in England, and is quickly made aware that he is different than other people. Yet he perseveres and eventually earns a degree in psychology from the University of Kniggle, an ironic accomplishment because Charlie is convinced that the Xique Xique were not human but instead the homo sapien's evolutionary cousins who simply lost the game of natural selection. When he recounts his moment of recognition he admits, \"I didn't know what I should do in life. But I believed it must involve impersonation; that to defend myself I'd have to gain a human facade.\" The facade is not one of appearance but of personality and motivation: Charlie adopts aggressiveness as his protective coloration. The author, who holds a doctorate on humor from the London School of Economics, accommodates the suspension of disbelief through a discreet use of puns that reinforces Charlie's beliefs and observations. The ending is inevitable but not contrived, and Wilson's commentary on the nature of humanity is solidly driven home.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One test often used by statisticians and researchers in their work is the Two-Way ANOVA, which determines the differences--and possible interactions--when variables are presented from the perspective of two or more categories.  When a Two-Way ANOVA is implemented, it enables one to compare and contrast variables resulting from independent or joint actions. This brief provides guidance on how R can be used to facilitate Two-Way ANOVA for data analysis and graphical presentation.  Along with instruction on the use of R and R syntax associated with Two-Way ANOVA, this brief will also reinforce the use of descriptive statistics and graphical figures to complement outcomes from parametric Two-Way ANOVA.", "related": [], "rank": 4308921, "title": "Two-Way Analysis of Variance: Statistical Tests and Graphics Using R (SpringerBriefs in Statistics Book 1)", "author": "Thomas W.

Various summer jobs included sitting on a horse while cattle grazed on grass alongside the road, working as a grunt in an oil refinery, being a stock boy, and he even sold Christmas trees for a few weeks one winter.   Most of his energy went into college degrees in physics, computer science and electrical engineering, which landed him a job at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  He’s been a computer programmer, a manager in computer science, information science, and cyber security, and a cynic of project management.  A lot of his technical writing involved the management of people and projects. That gave him the money and vacation time to learn how to build houses, to backpack in the Rocky Mountain high country, to climb mountains, to snowshoe and cross-country ski, to raft the rivers of the Southwest, to support Christian wilderness programs, and to see the excitement in his sons’ eyes as they enjoyed the adventures with him.  He is still given to wandering. He wishes he was a magician, but he’ll settle for writing mysteries that feature good kids, good families, great places, rich history, and clever plots.", "related": ["B007SGCB5Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I cut my teeth reading gothic romance and for years I've played with adding some of those elements to my stories. But with Stealing Darkness, I decided to go dark and deep with Minn's story. It's her own fears that challenge her the most and it's only when she can see past the fears from the past that she can move forward and go after a very real, very intense killer that only she can hear. She is the link that holds it all together. I hope you enjoy the story. The second novella in the series, Stealing Thunder, features Grace Sterling, Minn's sister and a woman with the unusual talent of manipulating psychic impressions from a dream state. She's got an unusual foe that she's fighting, but I gave her a wonderful hero with a few problems of his own to solve.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book brims with historical evidence-gathered from interviews and periodicals and painstakingly footnoted-that proves and provides nuance to Romanowski's argument...Especially fascinating is the illumination of the cultural and political forces that developed culture wars in the entertainment arena.\" --Publishers Weekly\"...thoroughly researched, astonishingly succinct study...serious students of the media and religion will savor its rich detail.\" --Booklist\"For those with an interest in popular culture and its relationship with Christianity, in this instance American Protestantism, Romanowski's book is illuminating.\" --Theology\"Thoroughly researched  readers will appreciate and learn much from the fresh perspective on the relation of religious Americans to the movies thatReforming Hollywoodoffers.\" --Church History\"Reforming Hollywoodis an important reminder of the role that affiliated Protestants played in the ongoing struggle against film censorship in the first half of the twentieth century.\" --Journal of American History\"This is one of those important books which may change the discourse in a discipline.

Weaving in fresh material from Protestant archives, this work contributes greatly to a fuller understanding of the constructive contributions of religious leaders to the Hollywood film industry.  This remarkably fresh, significant, and fascinating text truly reforms misunderstandings of Hollywood and religion.\"--Terrence Lindvall, C.S. Lewis Chair of Communication and Christian Thought, Virginia Wesleyan College\"Film history is filled with studies of how Jews and Catholics influenced the course of the movie industry. William D. Romanowski's pathbreaking study Reforming Hollywood reveals how a wide range of Protestant organizations waged their own battles for control of what audiences would or would not see on the screen-a battle that influenced the religious and moral content of American film from the silent era to the present.\"--Steven J. Ross, author ofHollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics\"As the first book to examine the relationship between Protestant church organizations and the motion picture industry,Reforming Hollywoodcorrects film history's tendency to exaggerate the influence of the Catholic Legion of Decency and its successors. In this authoritative account, Romanowski reveals how Hollywood's relationship with the Protestant establishment was crucial to debates around film regulation, and charts the erosion of its influence in the post-war years.

Her husband died in 1910, and she managed to return to England when war broke out. In this charming and romantic novel, first published in 1919, she obviously draws on her experiences during WWI, when a Germanic name could provoke prejudice and anti-German hysteria. At the beginning of the war, Anna-Rose and Anna-Felicitas von Twinkler, beautiful 17-year-old half-German orphan twins, are thrust upon their English relations. But their Uncle Arthur, fearing that these baby-faced innocents could be spies, convinces his wife that the girls must be packed off to stay with friends in the U.S. On the ship, they are befriended by Mr. Twist, a wealthy and kindhearted bachelor whose nurturing instincts are fully engaged by these two young women. Twist is not altogether unhappy to discover that his self-imposed charges continue to need his protection long after the ship docks. While the trio's ensuing adventures have a sweetly old-fashioned cast, there is, surprisingly, a modern feminism in the determination, good sense and resourcefulness of the young horoines as they triumph over suspicion and prejudice.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sets out in a methodical fashion to seduce a young heiress and elope with her, thereby laying claim to her fortune. But while courting his intended victim in the Lake District, Hatfield falls in love with Mary Robinson, a local beauty, and marries her. Exposed as an imposter by a suspicious colonel, Hatfield flees. The Bow Street Runners are sent after him and the chase is on. Hatfield-Hope is gradually revealed as a man who is at once a pathological liar, a religious mystic and a philanderer with a huge sexual appetite, whose unflagging devotion to \"his Mary\" is oddly touching.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An aspiring college professor, he studied Mathematics, German and History in college, including a year living in Europe.  By the time he finished graduate school, he knew that academia was not the right place for him.  He needed something with a little more real-world impact, so he went to law school at Northwestern University in Chicago.      Kirk spent the next five years in Chicago, graduating from law school and working at one of the big, sweat-shop law firms for which big-city legal circles are justly famous.  With a young family, he decided that life at the big firm was not worth the paycheck.  He took his family and moved to northwest Ohio where he spent the next several years at banks and a law firm, specializing in estate planning and trust administration.  He became an expert in how property is passed from one generation to the next – and the drama that can come with it.      After several years in that business, Kirk picked up his pen and started writing The Last McKenzie, many parts of which are based on Kirk’s actual experiences.  The Last McKenzie is Kirk’s first completed novel.  But it will not be his last.  Keep your eyes open for his next exciting thriller.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a mother, fitness trainer, Ford Motor Company employee she has always been an inspiration for others in more ways in one.    During her battle with cancer never once did she ask “Why Me”.  She said to herself and others “if it can happen to me, a person that eats healthy, works out 6 days a week, and no history of cancer on either side of my family then it can happen to anyone”.   Yolanda says, “Cancer has made her stronger, brought her and the family closer, and made her want to inspire and motivate other people and help make their fight easier”.  During her fight with cancer she decided to keep a journal of all the stages of the battle, the activities on a day to day basis and the people who supported her during the struggle.   The result of the journal is the manifestation of a book that became 26,000 words of inspiration during the fight against cancer.  The title of the book is “Cancer Was My Blessing”.   Yolanda believes this book will be an incredible inspiration for people battling cancer, and their families who want to understand this struggle and ways to deal with the daily ups and downs of the fight.   She started a non-profit foundation called Celebration of Life.  The foundation helps those in need and who need inspiration and motivation to keep fighting.  Upon receiving donations the Celebration of Life goes to hospitals and clinics and pays co-pays for cancer patients discretely (Paying it forward).  Also, the foundation receives and buys wigs to give patients that lose their hair in the process of fighting cancer.   Yolanda would love to have people to get involved before cancer touches their family and help motivate others to keep fighting cancer.  She asks, “If you know any who has cancer please share with them 26,000 words of inspiration, Cancer Was My Blessing”.   Get tested, early detection is vital!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well, she did turn out to be polite.               Even before I started digging, I knew this was a book I had to write. Growing up in Maine in the 1950s, I fell in love with small planes at the age of four. Not toy planes but small planes, the kind that could fly all over the Maine woods, sometimes landing on pontoons (wonderful word!) in remote lakes. My stepfather, a pilot and aerial photographer, took me along when I was older too, sometimes  pointing out from the air missile silos, a kind called BOMARC sites. The real thrill came from looking straight down at the ground from 18,000 feet, peeking through the gap  between the huge camera and the edge of the homemade opening it rested in. When you're the passenger, squeezed into a Piper Cub not designed for any passengers at all, you feel pretty heroic -- especially if you're twelve. It's easy to see why Amelia Earhart was number one on my list of brave women.

He was treasured father to Christopher “Kit” and Melissa; father-in-law to Chris; proud grandfather “Pa” to Lex; once-husband and continued friend to Elaine; and longtime special friend to Olga. He is also survived by several cousins. A professor at both Empire State College and SUNY Albany, and more recently, before retiring in 1992, deputy producing director of the New York State Theater Institute, he mentored, guided, and inspired a community of creative individuals, becoming their respected colleague and friend. A successful director at NYSTI, he was also an author of numerous novels and plays. He was the recipient of a 2004 Audie Award for the audio book adaptation of his play, The Killings Tale and, through NYSTI, he successfully partnered with Warner Home Video and DVD to create a video version of his original work A Tale of Cinderella. A man who believed “children are jewels of immeasurable worth,” he loved long walks, the Red Sox, Cape Cod, music, and inspiring people to believe in the magic within themselves.

It is wonderfully intelligent, terribly funny, thought provoking, often wise and always compelling. Think Milan Kundera meetsSouth Park. What unifies this wide ranging work is Jayson Iwen's fresh approach to form and language, and his ability to surprise us and turn us on our heads.\"—Tom Barbash, author ofThe Last Good Chance\"The words of Iwen's novella have angry sex with one another, climaxing in transcendent moments of laughter and love. His themes are our most fetishistic desires—to be both nurtured and do violence, to humiliate and be humiliated, to pervert history while singing our innocence. Such is the pathos of our uncertain age, and here is a marveously crafted tragic-comic record of it.\" —Christopher Grimes, author ofThe PornographersandPublic WorksPraise for Jayson Iwen'sSix Trips in Two Directions“Jayson Iwen’sSix Trips in Two Directionsis a stunning first book, joining private and public experience more effectively than any volume of poetry I’ve seen.”—Paul Hoover", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being a single parent and unable to find a suitable job because of the felonies on his record, he struggled to balance his street life during the day while his son was at daycare with being an attentive father at night. Soon, his street life got the best of him and he found himself locked up in federal prison with a fifteen year sentence. More depressed because he felt like he had failed his children, he began to vent out on paper to maintain his sanity. When a fellow inmate read his stories, he encouraged Kevin to submit them to a publisher. He thought that Kevin s work was just as good, if not better, than the urban books that were floating around. When the idea of being able to support his family from prison dawned on him, Kevin began to write feverishly. A year later, he signed a two book deal with Urban Lifestyle Press.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It has the power to change things. I recommend it. It may change your life too\" -Phil Gosling, Author - Success Engineering\"MindCompass lets you discover how to quickly and easily harness the power of your subconscious mind into your very own personal guidance system. It is all about programming your mind for success in all kinds of areas:wealth, health, success, love-whatever you need.Now to be honest, I have seen books that talk about getting your mind right for success before. Some have been good and some have been awful.MindCompass is way better than any that I have read before(and I've read a lot!)The whole thing (and yes, I have downloaded everything) is massive and very well thought out and put together. But how big it is and how well conceived are secondary to the one really important question:does it work?...I have to say yes. Having studied self development materials for most of my adult life I can tell when something is blindingly brilliant or bafflingly BS.

I ran them past my own little ones before sharing with the world, and they were a hit. Each owl has a name, and they are all displayed together on the back page so kids can meet them and then look for their favorite one on the other pages of the book.  \"Ten Little Owls\" is the first in  the series \"Ten Little Animals.\" Upcoming books in the series contain a similar illustration style for various animals, and teach other simple concepts.I am confident my young readers will enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": [], "rank": 4233466, "title": "Ten Little Owls (Ten Little Animals Book 1)", "author": "Rose Breuer", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What makes our relationship so special is that we believe in each other’s dreams. You know what you want baby so own the studio and I will be there for you. What I have learned in life is that we never get to old to dream. Dream baby, Dream baby. I am also a people person and have been in other States and ran into people that I grew up with. I'm often teased about this. I love to go on long train rides and talk and make friends while getting to my destination. I also have two adult sons who I love so much and will also help them to accomplish their dreams. I have traveled the world and I think I like Brazil the most. They have uptown and downtown. And also rum punch and a lot of carnivals. I also like to dance and go on cruises.

No obstante, sí me hizo pensar sobre si una chica de catorce años era de verdad capaz de enamorarse, y decidir contar una historia de amor sobre una muchacha de una\nedad similar. De pronto me encontré escribiendo, sin tener siquiera un\nargumento preparado. A decir verdad, ni siquiera tenía nombre para la\nprotagonista. Justo entonces apareció la reina Sofía en las noticias, y\nme pareció un nombre precioso para la protagonista.Sofía es una\nchica normal, como se puede encontrar en todas partes. Es valiente, pero\n no está preparada para morir. Cuando se le ofrece una posibilidad de\nsalvarse, aceptará. Está aterrada, pero acepta. Lo que no sabe es cómo\nva a cambiar ella, cómo va a cambiar su vida.

This internal narrative is so vivid and disjointed that readers will likely find John both fascinating and repulsive as he stews with \"impotent rage at the wrong done to him\" yet experiences neither remorse nor compassion. As the pace increases, the focus splits between John and a team of police investigators trying to capitalize on his few mistakes in order to catch him. The technical, procedural aspects of these sections are just as well-written and convincing as John's surreal, violent inner monologues...Fans of Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs and Shane Stevens' By Reason of Insanity may find a new favorite author here.

But when attempts to contact Jana result in a few vague text messages, Jake and Laurie go looking for her, suspecting something’s wrong when Jana’s employer, scientist Dr. Gregory Mirek, doesn’t seem to have an office in Los Angeles. Soon the couple is submerged in deception, blackmail and very possibly murder. Kolinski’s novel has a strange but fascinating structure: A romantic relationship between two lead characters starts before the mystery begins. This fits the storyline—the two initially believe that Jana is too busy with her job to respond to emails or texts—but it also makes sense when Jake and Laurie eventually travel together, even hopping a plane to Las Vegas. Jake is a complex protagonist, all too happy to escape Iowa, where he was the sole survivor of a workplace killing spree and suspected by an overzealous detective. And he can deliver understated one-liners: In one of the story’s best scenes, he and Laurie troll a college campus for Dr. Mirek’s research team, and seeing a group photo, Jake drolly asks, “Which one of these guys looks disgruntled to you?” The plot includes accusations of animal abuse—the doc’s field is primatology—and unflinching descriptions may scare off some animal lovers, but Kolinski doesn’t dwell on the imagery or exploit it for shock value. It’s simply another murky element of the couple’s descent into a seedy world, in the same way that Vegas is cast in a less-than-glamorous light with smoke-laden, tattered casinos. The mystery hints at future events, including an early indication of Jana’s whereabouts, and doesn’t deliver easy answers; most of the plot unfolds via Jake’s and Laurie’s theories, which are on the mark only some of the time.Readers will eagerly follow the reckless, entertaining protagonist as he navigates LA and Vegas in this sinuous mystery.", "related": ["B005M3IN72"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

Danny loved kindergarten and never wanted to leave. Danny even stated: \"I'll be in kindergarten until I'm married\" and he truly didn't want to move into the first grade. This is because he knew he would have to learn a lot of new things that he wasn't ready to embark upon. Danny was determined that he didn't want to learn any more than what he already had and he didn't want to go to school. However, his mother came up with a super idea and early on the morning of his first day he was scheduled to attend first grade, she and Danny went to various places, meeting people who Danny thought had made it in life. However, he soon realized that construction workers, gardeners, and fishermen had long, tiring days that were not filled with fun and adventure, and were rather filled with hard work and challenges. Does this revelation change Danny's mind?Why Study? challenges the young reader to do more with their life by learning, growing, and becoming a educated person with more options and opportunities in life. This would be an excellent book to read at school. This would also be a great tool for parents to read and share with their children to encourage them to not become discouraged in school, but rather to dig in harder and become the achiever they truly can become.", "related": [], "rank": 3282653, "title": "Why Study?- Early Children's Education Book+e-Video, (Preschool picture book) Bedtime Dreaming Children's Book (Good night Children's Story eBook Collection).: ...

Of course there is the obvious meaning, but there are other seductions anyone can fall prey to that aren't nearly as pleasurable. Being seduced by the comfort of the familiar, for instance, because it is so much easier to stay within the boundaries you're used to rather than making a change. Or being seduced into inaction by fear of rejection, or by your own insecurities. All seduction is based on finding the key within yourself, or within someone else, which appeals to you the most. And, as Stephen discovers, you can be seduced into loving someone without even knowing it has happened until it's almost too late.Hopefully our story can seduce you into believing that love comes to everyone, and that it really does conquer all.", "related": ["B00KPBLFAS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I currently serve as our church's Director of Intentional Discipling. I do extensive work with older adult ministries at both the local and conference levels. Because of my certification, I have been requested to \"fill the pulpit\" by several pastors over the years. For many years, I have taught adult Sunday school classes. I am also a teacher of Bible studies, covering most of its books and discipling studies such as 'Christian Believer' At present, I am teaching two classes on Genesis/Revelation. My last publication that I authored was 'Subtracting Fears for the Future; Revelation's Timeless Message' which was published in 2005. I am a proud native Texan transplanted happily in the Central Florida town of Apopka. I grew up in a loving family in Abilene, Texas, where I developed my love for Jesus Christ and for continuing education. As a youth, I served as a Youth Director at a church in Amarillo, Texas. Along with my late husband, I graduated from Texas Tech University. Upon graduation, we joyfully settled down to raise a family of four. I am a retired school teacher but I have never lost my love for teaching. My belief is that when one teaches, one learns. Though my passions involve something as mundane as a good game of bridge, the main force in my life is Christian discipleship. I am always urging myself and others on the journey toward following Jesus Christ. 'The Light and The Way' has been an ongoing process over the years and with its daily Bible study devotionals, this is my Divinely inspired manifesto.

She graduated from university with a degree in communications and held a variety of positions in journalism, education, government and non profit. While her writing during this period was business related as she wrote for a newspaper, marketing newsletters and press releases she remained dedicated to romance fiction. She began to write long chapters on a website for romance and was voted top romance story for \"The Sheik and the Slave.\" She soon had a following of loyal fans and started a blog to focus solely on her stories. Her fans are amazing and she remains deeply indebted to them. They have encouraged her to continue writing and have been extremely supportive. Nicola has traveled extensively throughout Europe, China and Central America. She speaks basic Spanish and has a love of all languages. Nicola's goal is to create rich characters with a strong male lead and a passionate female lead. She also strives to set her books in places not normally written about such as Arabia in \"The Sheik and the Slave.\" \"We all want a happy ending but I like to create some friction and chase before my leads come together,\" Nicola has said.

The action scenes were believable and well-timed, making it easy to get caught up in the danger and the explosive passion between this threesome, which stimulates the senses.

Unfortunately she\ntakes 'hard-hitting' to a new level that threatens her future as a\njournalist. After a disheartening encounter with a professor, Audrey is a\n staunch advocate of equality and fairness, which sets the stage for the\n celebratory night out with friends that leads to her steamy night with\nlocal celebrity Brandon Thomas. The morning after their steamy night,\nhowever, Brandon thinks she used him for a story and Audrey thinks he's\nplaying games with a plain Jane. Kaelyn Swan perfects the art of making a\n random hookup read like the coming together of the greatest couple of a\n generation. The chemistry between Audrey and Brandon is sizzling right\nfrom the beginning and it's enough to make you want to see how things\nunfold with these two.I love a love story where the heroine isn't all that enthralled with the\n hero from the beginning. Of course Audrey is attracted to Brandon --\nhe's gorgeous -- but his morning after behavior makes her believe he is\nyour average egotistical celeb on the rise. Unfortunately in He Has Me,\nneither Audrey nor Brandon can ignore the lust and other uncomfortable\nfeelings they have toward each other. But can a love in the shadows\nendure? And more importantly, can a secret this big stay secret? Kaelyn\nSwan has written a wonderful story that is filled with as much passion\nas tender love, which is a difficult feat on its own. Audrey and Brandon\n are great characters and I enjoyed following them as they explored\nunwanted feelings that blossomed into so much more. ~Natasha Jackson, Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That continues today with the popularity of birding (bird-watching) and the rise of ecotourism around the world. There are approximately 10,500 bird species in the world, and many of them have significant relationships to people—food, recreation, art, origin stories, research, and religion, to name a few. Hundreds of birders from around the world flocked together to assist Cocker via stories and observations, building this fascinating compilation of significant human-bird relationships. Entries represent 146 bird families, while another 59 families with no known cultural importance are listed in an appendix. Tipling’s photographs (and others) supplement the text with beautiful images and informative content.   This is both a reference book and a book to be read for enjoyment. The quotations, extensive bibliography, detailed endnotes, and indexes (species and general) provide access beyond the family-group arrangement of the text. Readers will learn fascinating facts: humans have long adorned themselves with feathers and imitated avian dances; swallow nests near homes are symbols of natural blessings in many countries; rollers have capitalized on human structures as perches from which to hunt insects.   This thoughtful and handsome book records many of the stories that bind humans and birds together in the environment they share. Recommended for most public and academic libraries. --Linda Scarth", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
