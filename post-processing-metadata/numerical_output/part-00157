What begins as an act of charity, though--a chance for the tough-hided and perspicacious, but lonely ex-con paparazza to aid another female at loose ends in the world--soon lands Nina in the quirky company of space-alien worshippers, fugitive teenage cultists, and grave robbers intent on plundering the mortal remains of immortal Hollywood icons.Our heroine (last seen inBurning Garbo) doesn't really have time to worry about 15-year-old Theresa, a celebrity-obsessed Midwesterner whose lukewarm tip about a has-been screen hunk results in Nina being roughed up, her cameras trashed; she already has her own problems. The prominently pierced photog is being evicted from her Venice Beach apartment; her long-abused mother has just perished from a stroke; and her elder sister, whom she hasn't seen in 24 years, has barely reappeared in her life, before she rips Nina off for $19,000--and is beaten to death during a raid on the crypt of silent-movie legend Rudolph Valentino. That last crime seems ideal fare forScandal Times, the sensationalistic journal from which Nina draws her paychecks--especially since it follows an assault on the Indiana grave of actor James Dean, who died in a 1955 highway accident. But as Nina struggles to exorcise her grief and anger through decisive action, by exposing Hollywood's enigmatic Church of Divine Thespians, executing a Rockford-style desert car rescue, and fleeing a blaze meant to send her to her own last reward, she unearths a tale so outlandish as to amaze even jadedScandal Timesreaders. And the fatally naïve Theresa sits at the center of it all.Eversz hit a pell-mell storytelling pace withBurning Garbo, which he maintains in this clever sequel. He capitalizes nicely on the lore and landmarks of Los Angeles, and over the course of four hip mysteries (beginning with 1996'sShooting Elvis) has developed a punk protagonist intrepid enough to draw reader attention, and compassionate enough to hold onto it. Though the mastermind behindDigging James Dean's bloodshed boasts all the subtlety of a Bela Lugosi villain, Nina Zero's relentless pursuit of her sibling's slayer makes this wild ride worthwhile. It may even owe a debt to Dean himself, who said, \"Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today.\" --J.

This is a broad treatment at a level appropriate for undergraduate science students and sophisticated nonscience majors.  The roles of randomness and order in subjects such as quantum  mechanics, galactic origin and evolution, molecular biology, the evolution of species, and the development of language are presented and discussed in a way that ties them together....Since the chapters are somewhat self-contained, the book could be used effectively as outside reading in a 'science  for nonscientist' class.\"--Choice\"Inspired by cosmology, Layzer deals with the paradox of creation of order by saying that, if entropy in the environment increases more than the entropy of the system, then the system becomes more ordered in that environment. Entropy and order can both increase at the same time without  violating the second law of thermodynamics. This phenomenon can be described as: if the expansion of a set of systems is so quick that a number of states which are occupied increases less rapidly than the number of states which are available (i.e., the phase space gets bigger), entropy and order can  increase at the same time. Unlike Prigogine, Layzer does not need to assume that an energy flow from the environment of a system can cause a local decrease in entropy within the system. Entropy and order increase together because the realization of structure lags behind the expansion of phase  space.\" -- Piero Scaruffi, Thymos.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Turkish experience is full of lessons for those who are interested in Islam-state relations in other Muslim countries. This book, therefore, is a candidate to become a must-read for the students of Middle Eastern politics in particular and of religion and politics in general.\"—Comparative Political Studies\"Turam's study provides valuable insights into the mental framework of large sections of Turkish society.\"—Lutz Berger,National Identities\"Berna Turam's study of Islam and democracy in Turkey also advances debates about Islamist moderation. She tackles a crucial case study—Turkey's mainstream Islamists—because Turkey would seem to be a case ofexclusionleading to moderation . . . [Turam] emphasizes everyday interactions, rather than a focus on the inclusion of Islamists into electoral politics or the formal political system . . . Turam draws attention to a whole political context and not merely to a sequence of mechanisms that affect the behaviors and/or ideologies of discrete Islamist groups and individuals.\"—Jillian Schwedler,World Politics\"Berna Turam's book is one of the best to have been published recently on the interaction between Islam and the secular state in Turkey . . . Her study stands as an excellent analysis of what one might call 'Turkish exceptionalism.'  As such, it is must reading of anyone who wishes to understand contemporary Turkey and the implications of the Turkish experience for other Muslim-majority countries.\"—The Middle East Journal\"Turam's book is an excellent counterintuitive account of Turkish politics in the last ten years . . . Turam shows how a non-confrontational politics have allowed the Turkish secular state and the Islam-inspired Gulen movement and the Justice and Development Party (known by its Turkish acronym AKP) to interact, reshape each other, and expand democratic institutions.\"—Contemporary Sociology\"Turam's essay is an important contribution to the Islam–state interface in Turkey. Not only does it refute the received wisdom concerning that relationship, which has long attributed less than valid motives to both the Islamic actors and the secularists in Turkey, but it also to a great extent explains the evolving dynamics behind that interface . . . This essay deserves to be a must-read for students of the Islam–state relationship both in Turkey and elsewhere.\"—Turkish Studies\"Turam's richly researched book . . . makes an extremely important contribution to understanding the relationship between the state and Islamic political actors. Rich detail shows political Islam as a complex and contradictory phenomenon. Islamic political actors engage with various aspects of modern life on an ongoing basis and the outcome of this engagement is not necessarily conflict and confrontation. Perhaps an even more significant observation to emerge from this book is that the representation of Islamic actors in public discourse can encourage engagement and foster social and political pluralization in the public sphere.\"—Canadian Journal of Sociology\"The book is a fine contribution to the scholarship on the negotiation of secularism.\"—CHOICEx", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Matthew Strong is a 16-year-old computer geek out to find a solution to world hunger, but he can't manage to get his widowed father's attention. When Matt probes the workings of Agrimax, one of the world's top three suppliers of food, company executives murder his friend-and come after Matt. With the key to Agrimax's unwholesome activities in his hands, the teen improbably flees to Mexico and then France in search of someone from the organization I-FEED (International Federation for Environmental and Economic Development) who can help him expose the nefarious company. In hot pursuit are Matt's beloved computer teacher, Jill Pruitt (\"a bundle of bouncy, blonde energy\"), and his \"handsome, weather-beaten\" rancher-father, Cole. The cliched initial antagonism between Jill and Cole signals that romance is inevitable. In a ridiculous series of improbable events, Matt meets a classy chain-smoking Frenchwoman who flies him from France to the Sudan in a specially chartered airplane to find the chairman of I-FEED. As Matt reflects, \"It was like some kind of a movie where... everything was warped and strange and unbelievable.\" Raising awareness of world hunger and unmasking the greed of large agricultural companies are admirable goals for the talented Palmer to shoot for; this novel, however, misses the mark.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kristy joins the school swim team, determined to excel at something and make her parents as proud of her as they are of Kirk.

The problem with his plans is that, after being reinstated at the Denver P.D., his first assigned case is that of a wife and mother being murdered in her own bedroom. The now widowed husband decides to play games with the detective because the incriminating evidence against him is missing. Then there is Jennifer Parker, Glen's psychic friend who helps him unlock talents he never suspected he has.  The sixth volume in a superbly crafted masterpiece of detailed storytelling that fully engages the reader from beginning to end with unpredictable plot twists, memorable characters and an unexpected conclusion. --Midwest Book ReviewYou get a mystery and a puzzle with this Nebraska author. In her sixth book in her Elusive Clue Series there is--as always--a hidden word puzzle that reveals the killer for those clever enough to find the page(s) and the name. Here, the venue is a small Colorado town a half hour away from Denver. A Denver homicide detective grew up there and has just purchased a nearby ranch homestead. He has dogs that need veterinary attention and that leads into the mystery. Some people in the neighborhood are dying off in rapid sequence and the county sheriff is too lazy and arrogant to understand that the victims are tied into the vet's clinic. Ah, the plot thickens. Glen Karst, the detective, is a handsome bachelor who likes bourbon and cheesecake and has plenty of local gals willing to provide both. He finds lots of interesting help from them to search out the killer. There are references to previous novels in the series here, but they don't really get in the way of a down-home, small-town, engaging mystery. --Lincoln Journal Star", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the eldest of two daughters, U.S.-raised Bijou Roy struggles to fulfill traditional male roles for the burial of her father, Nitish, culminating in a trip with her mother and sister to Calcutta to scatter his ashes. In the unfamiliar country, each step of the process reinforces Bijou's alienation, from the people and culture as well as from her mother, who continues to keep Nitish's past shrouded in secrecy. It's only after meeting Naveen, the son of Nitish's oldest friend, that Bijou begins to comprehend her father's political entanglements and the reasons her parents migrated years before. As she learns more about her father, Bijou predictably gains insight into her own character, but Bijou's struggle to reconcile tradition with the demands of the modern world is propelled by skillful, luminous prose.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Prophesied at birth to have a wealthy but disastrous marriage, Parvathi, a poor Ceylonese girl, is married to a powerful man who despises her; she survives life in his house by devoting herself to her children, to a kindly servant, and to Maya, a powerful healer. When Japanese soldiers invade during WWII, she experiences love and passion for the first time in the arms of a commanding officer named Hattori. Manicka's lush, subtle, and arresting story stands out for its unforgettable characters and its emphasis on familial love and friendship as equally (if not more) important than romantic love; indeed, to call this a romance would be misleading. Unfortunately, this otherwise engrossing work is marred by intrusive New Age spirituality, often turning Maya into little more than a mouthpiece, and a glossing over of Japanese war crimes in Malaysia.

Other churches preach what sounds like grace, while slipping in some minor rules about good things like tithing and quiet times.As Paul explained to the Galatians, any reliance upon anything other Jesus and the free gift of grace not only pollutes the Gospel, it results in a complete loss of the Gospel!The Gospel Uncensoredcontinues in the tradition of the reformers as the authors challenge teaching and trends in today's churches that would seek to steal the Gospel from your grasp. The issues are not new, and neither is the message. Sadly, however, in many churches today the simple Gospel message has been lost. The words Martin Luther wrote in the introduction to his commentary on Galatians are no less true today:\"The devil, our adversary, who continually seeks to devour us, is not dead; likewise our flesh and old man is yet alive... So this doctrine can never be taught, urged, and repeated enough. If this doctrine is lost, then is also the whole knowledge of the truth, life and salvation lost.\"The Gospel is not just about salvation, it is about life; it is Good News about everything we do as Christians.

When Lily's father is mortally wounded, Neville promises the dying man that he will protect Lily by marrying her and giving her his name; as an officer's wife--and a viscountess to boot--Lily will be treated with respect in case of capture. But the two share only one glorious night of passion and discovery after their wedding, for the next day Neville watches in horror as Lily, his wife and the woman he loves, is killed in a skirmish with the French. He, too, is severely wounded and barely escapes with his life. Eighteen months later, Neville is again preparing to be married, this time to the eminently suitable young woman his family has always planned for him to wed. However, one of the guests, albeit uninvited, has grounds to object to the union; the groom is already married--to her! Neville and Lily struggle to wed their worlds together while overcoming the horror of Lily's capture and imprisonment, while a secret lurks nearby that threatens to destroy their growing love.

I set the series where I live in Brooklyn Heights, a borough of New York City filled with old brownstone mansions of yesteryear (some of them still have hitching posts and gas lights outside their doors).The main character in my book, Timothy Elliott is an ordinary boy. He lives with his widowed mother, Katie Elliott and goes to a dreadfully boring school for boys called St. Basils and his life is well, boring. Then one day he discovers he has the gift of time travel and he goes on an adventure with Theodore Roosevelt to discover a lost river in the Amazon. I believe that in all of us we have a special gift just waiting to be tapped and I hope by reading this series you will find your gift.And fear not girls, Volume II - Solo With Amelia Earhart is set at the St. Agatha's School for girls and stars none other than Timothy's mom, Kate Elliott.

Roy's life is populated by a crew of wayward boys--the Viper, Magic Frank, and Crazy Lester--who all must confront violence, mental illness, and death in their cold and windy enclave. The world is not entirely gloomy; Roy's development as a writer and love for his mother are rays of light in even the novel's bleakest moments. Though Roy's adventures have the classic footloose appeal of coming-of-age adventures, it's the rogue's gallery of supporting characters that are most memorable, from the Albanian lothario Cubar Shog and mobbed up Sharkface Bensky to the numerous other cutthroats in Roy's orbit. Gifford, best known for his Sailor and Lula novels (Wild at Heart; etc.), has a soft, transporting touch that makes a strong case for this being a one-sitting endeavor.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her fiction is diverse, with novels like the edgy, coming-of-age drama DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS, and the fun family adventure for kids of all ages, COMIC SQUAD. Having grown up reading different authors like Danielle Steel and Stephen King, Ginger has always been drawn more to story than to genre. This shows up in her various stories. Titles such as MY IMMORTAL and TASTE OF BLOOD are a delicious, heady mix of horror, suspense, and romance. Genre romance, however, has held a special place in her heart, ever since she read her first Harlequin novel when she was only eleven. As a result, Ginger is making a name for herself writing romances of her own, starring women who look more like the average American woman rather than those traditionally represented in the size-biased American media. Her Rubenesque romances were created especially for those heroines with fuller figures, who can still get the man of their dreams if only they believe they can. Such titles include UNDER TEXAS SKIES, LOVE PLUS ONE, GROUPIE and PICTURE POSTCARDS. Her contemporary, Rubenesque titles have even won her category best-selling distinctions on the All Romance e-Books website. Ginger was included in the best-selling book by Smith Magazine NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS PLANNING, featuring her six-word memoir. Additionally you can read her essay KISSED BY A MUSE published on the website for Smith Magazine's 2011 project THE MOMENT. It demonstrates how an influential teacher and a spark of creative thinking changed an 11-year-old's perspective in an instant and gave her a passion for a lifetime.", "related": ["B00HH1JVCI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Grubbs was a very action packed book that contained many characteristics of amust-read. The story is about six individuals that have fought together in their days as Navy SEALs. Throughout their journey they all have developed a special friendship within each other, especially the two main characters in novel; Bart Nelson, and Chelsea. As four years passed without seeing each other, Chelsea is the reason for the six SEALs coming together for one more important task, cracking the code into human trafficking and saving Chelsea's sister. I enjoyed everything about this book. The plot not only was enjoyable, but very true as well. It made me as a reader not only kept my eyes glued to the book, but also allowed my mind to wonder into the world of human trafficking, and how fast it is growing throughout the world and how much money is earned within this industry. This book displays many different characteristics such as betrayal, heartache, love, courage, determination, and friendship. Each character in this book showed their many attributes throughout the book. Bart was one of the most compelling characters. His skills as a former SEAL did him great justice as him and his comrades traveled throughout the country, he provided the Chelsea with loving friendship as the journey fro her sister became a great struggle. As a reader I loved how the emotion could be felt between the two. They both continued to remain focused and determined as they were betrayed and back stabbed by the people they thought they could depend on to the end. Many people would enjoy this book and it should be recommended to everyone who is willing to read it. It not only provides good entertainment, but acts as an insight the world of human trafficking. --Courtney S.

(Barry Brummett, University of Texas-Austin)In her introduction to this objective essay collection, Goodnow (Oregon State Univ.) asserts The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an entertainment program on Comedy Central, persuades by means of political satire. In their 13 essays, contributors compare The Daily Show to traditional news; consider the political arguments that host Jon Stewart makes; discuss strategies used to inform audiences; and contemplate the ways in which the show handles specific issues, such as race, religion, and sexual preference. The volume is similar to Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post Network Era, ed. by Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey Jones, and Ethan Thompson (CH, Sep'09, 47-0107), but is of course more limited topically.

He was an attorney and like many farmers in that region, he had Japanese-American tenant farmers handle the day-to-day operations of the farm.  When the war started and the Japanese-Americans were put in camps, it was left to the land owners, their kids, etc., to help keep the farms going. A neighbor's teenager, then doing the chores that the Japanese-Americans usually did, uncovered an anti-aircraft gun hidden under a huge haystack in the barn. The Army was called and they picked up the massive weapon.When I first heard this story, my imagination went into overdrive. How did they even get an anti-aircraft gun? When was it going to be used? Was there some sort of plan? A date of an attack and they were going to use it against our own planes? Of course, hearing the story also went against everything I have always believed - that the Japanese-Americans should not have been sent to camps, they were pro-America, etc. But then I realized that you can't put tens of thousands of people all in one category.  What happened on that farm in Norwalk, California, did in fact happen. However, to this day, I firmly believe the reasoning behind incarcerating Japanese-Americans to internment camps was wrong. This is clear when you look back in history at the many Nisei - second generation Japanese-Americans - who served this country honorably in combat during the war.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": 879270, "title": "Toward Night's End", "author": "M.H.

His imaginative negotiation of the traffic between evolutionary thought and narrative experiments in late Qing and Republican China--with the legendary figure of Lu Xun at the center of his analysis--will speak to larger questions of civilization and belatedness that have typically marked debates on modernity outside of the 'normative' West. (Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago)Developmental Fairy Talesis a provocative work that rethinks the meaning of Chinese modernity and post-modernity. By examining the development of 'development'—as trope, discourse, institution, and various forms of cultural production—from the late Qing to the new millennium, it provides a fresh perspective for anyone interested in modern Chinese cultural, intellectual, and literary studies. (David Der-wei Wang, Harvard University)Andrew Jonesmasterfully analyzes how notions of the modern in China have been thoroughly invested by an obsession with development. In doing so, he makes new sense out of well-trodden ideas, and the brilliant work of linking them under the overarching theme of 'development' knits them together as never before and sheds an innovative light on the intellectual trajectory of 20th-century China.

I have a hard time believing that all of these other psychic mediums who claim to talk to celebrities from the other side are for real too - especially the ones who say, \"So and so told me she picked me and will not communicate through anyone else.\" With all the skeptics and frauds out there, you don't know what to believe. But if you have any inclination to believe in a metaphysical reality, that we are all connected, and that on a level beyond the physical senses we can and do communicate with each other, this is not so unbelievable. All I can say is that I know what I felt and heard when I was communicating with these spirits, and it was exciting, uplifting, spiritual, inspiring, and gave me hope. I felt an enormous amount of love. I felt comforted. I felt lifted up from the \"boundaries\" I have created for myself in this physical world to a place where life is endless and the possibilities are unlimited. I felt inspired to be a better person, to pay attention to the small things that make a big difference in the universal scheme. I was reminded that money and fame do not buy happiness or a ticket to heaven. I was told that angels have freely chosen to come into this world to help us. I was comforted with the assurance that no matter what hardships we endure in this life, we will find peace. I was made aware of how our day-to-day choices affect us more than we know. It became clear to me that we can make big changes in the world with our own simple acts of kindness via a ripple effect. And after I finished the book, I just happened to find a magazine article with a picture of Balmoral Castle. The caption described it as the \"country house,\" indicating that was where the royal family was gathered after Princess Diana's death. I smiled to myself. You see, I am an American, born and raised in Washington State. I have never heard of a country house before. When she told me she was at the \"country house\" after her death, I pictured a small house in the countryside of England. I had no idea that the spirit of the Princess was referring to Balmoral Castle. In fact, I had never even heard of Balmoral Castle. If for no other reason, read this book for the messages. Even if you cannot get past the belief that people cannot communicate with dead people, the messages are positive, uplifting, and bound to make you think. They may even change the way you live your life.", "related": [], "rank": 1508615, "title": "Voices From Eternity: Inspirational Spirit Messages From Personalities We Knew and Loved", "author": "Sara Mitchell", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The plot is intricate and characters many shaded. There are tender, moving scenes and moments of poignancy. This tale of a middle-aged man in modern Portugal caught up in links to his youthful adventures, while both a thriller and a romance, yet without polemics raises ethical questions about exploitation and man's inhumanity to man.

Yet there was one great\nstory he was unable to fit in, and he has been aching to share it with the\nworld ever since.    With\nthe just-releasedSUR: Legend of the Last Otter Hunter, that story's time has come. A\nshort novel of historical fiction,SURwas inspired by (cannery worker) Charlie Nonella's\nrecollections of his father, who (among other, mostly illegal things), was the\nlast otter hunter in the region. He was a \"crack shot\" and an expert boatman.\nFor a time he and Charlie ran the surf at Bixby in longboats to deliver\ndynamite to the beach.    Otters\nhad been largely wiped out by the mid-1800s, but for those like Nonella's\nfather that possessed an intimate knowledge of Big Sur's remote coves (no road\nwas built until 1937), there was still a living to be made: At the turn of the\ncentury, otter pelts sold for about $2,000.     The\nspirit of Hemp's lead character (William Manning) was modeled after Clint\nEastwood's lead inUnforgiven(William Munny), and Hemp dedicates the book to Eastwood. When\nreadingSUR,\nit is a pleasure to imagine Eastwood's charged, gravelly restraint in the voice\nof Manning, and the narrative, which is rich with fascinating, historical\nexposition, is a quick, entertaining read.    Hemp's\npostscript touches on Big Sur pioneer Howard Sharpe's 1935 discovery of an\n\"extinct\" otter colony, and the rest, as they say, is history.    -- David\nSchmalz, Monterey County Weekly, September 15, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His first novel 'Ring Fenced' was published in November 2011 and this is a crime story with a difference as the underlying theme is obsession tinged with power, control and how they are used and abused. This novel was followed by a collaboration with Elly Grant to produce 'Twists and Turns' a book of short stories and flash fiction. Zach’s second novel 'Made a Killing' was the first of a series of Alex Warren murder mysteries (published in November 2012) and this has been followed by 'A Measure of Trouble' (August 2013). Zach is currently working on a novel based on investigative jounalism. Alike his central character in 'Ring Fenced,' (Bemjamin Short), Zach Abrams grew up within an orthodox Jewish family. He completed his education in Scotland and went on to a career in business and finance. He is married with two children. He plays no instruments and has an eclectic taste in music, although not as obsessive as Benjamin. Unlike Benjamin, he does not maintain mistresses, write pornography and (sadly) he does not have ownership of such a wealthy company. He is not a sociopath (at least by his own reckoning) and all versions of his life are aware of and freely communicate with each other.  More in keeping with Alex Warren, he and his family reside in the south side of Glasgow.

After all, he has cared for Branwenn all of his adult life and now that duty has been transferred,\" Lady Maclean said.Branwenn bit her lip and bowed her head.\"My dear, you mistake my meaning,\" Lady Maclean rushed to explain. \"He had no desire to discontinue his care of you, 'twas only his need to keep you safe from the predators of the court that prompted his settling you here.\"\"Aye, he has made that quite plain to me. Still, 'tis no easier for me to watch him depart.\"* * *Jesslyn and Alleck came through the open gateway at that moment and Maryn waived to them.Alleck tried to pull away from Jesslyn's grip on his hand, but she would not release him. \"Mama! I want to say g'bye to Bao!\"\"We'll say our farewells in a moment, Alleck. Can you not see that Daniel and Bao are trying to speak privily? 'Twould be rude to interrupt them.\"\"But I wanna show Laird Daniel the trick Bao taught me last eve.\"\"You shall have plenty of time to do so after Bao is on his way.\"Alleck tugged harder. \"I wanna show him now, while Bao's here to watch me, too!\"Her son had been trying her patience all morning with his demands and belligerence. Though Jesslyn knew he was acting out as a way to deal with his own feelings of sadness at Bao's departure, the tight reins she'd been keeping on her temper finally snapped. After hauling him a distance away from the group, she got down on her knees so that they were eye-to-eye and said, \"You are not going to bother Daniel and Bao right now, do you understand?\"Alleck bobbed up and down. \"But, Mama--\"\"Nay, no 'buts'. For I am the mother and you are the bairn; I am the leader and you are the follower. Whatever I say is law. At least until you are grown and wed. Do you ken me, lad?\"His shoulders slumped in defeat. Bowing his head, he said, \"Aye, Mama.\" After a moment, he looked up and cocked his head to the side, a question in his countenance. \"So when I'm grown and wed I'll get to be leader?\"Jesslyn grinned and tweaked her son's nose. \"Nay, then your wife shall be leader.\"Alleck giggled and stuck out his chest, pointing at it with his thumb. \"Nay! I'll be leader and my wife will do whatever I say. Even if I tell her to eat worms or roll in horse dung.\"Bao and Daniel walked up just as Alleck said the last and they both chuckled.Daniel ruffled Alleck's hair. \"Lad, you have a lot to learn about wives if you think you'll ever be able to get one to do something she does not wish to do, just by giving her an order. Take it from me, as I am now an expert on the subject.\"Alleck rolled his eyes, clearly not believing Daniel's words. Then, looking up at his mother, he asked, \"Now can I show Laird Daniel my trick?\"Jesslyn nodded, too aware of the dark-haired warrior standing beside her to speak. She'd found one of Bao's foreign coins on her pillow when she'd awakened this morn.

He may have drifted away from fiction at times, but it was always his first love – and he always returned to it. Now living in Bethesda with his fiancée, two cats, and two quirky guinea pigs for whom his publishing company is named, he crafts the kinds of stories that he had always hoped to read but just couldn’t quite find.

So we were invited officially by the Russian Minister of Education, as Christian educators, and asked to teach Russian public school teachers a course on Christian morals and ethics based on the life and teachings of Jesus so they could then teach the same course to their students.It is ironic that the same course we were asked to teach Russian public school teachers could not be taught, or would not even be considered, in the United States. Could our political leaders be taking us down the wrong road?     We were in Russia when people began realizing the difficulties involved with changing from a totalitarian to a nascent democratic form of government. They suddenly realized that socialism didn't work but they didn't know any other way. They wanted freedom, but they didn't understand that freedom wasn't really free. They didn't appreciate how long it took to develop a democratic country where if you ever needed a helping hand you just looked to the end of your own arm, as my father-in-law used to say. They didn't understand that with every handout a portion of their freedom was compromised.     The Russians eventually started questioning whether democracy was all that important to them. They felt that embracing democracy was just a matter of pushing the right buttons and everything would fall into place--but they soon found it just didn't  work that way. All they knew was that they didn't have as much to eat now as they once did.     They started to want the old regime back into power.  It didn't matter to them how much freedom they had now that they were hungry. Most of the people were willing to trade their freedom for some food on the table.During this time of uncertainty, we also witnessed the rise of the Russian mafia and how it affected the people.     We found the Russian way of life and their traditions to be quite different from those to which we were accustomed.  Some might even say these were charming. Others, coming from a different culture and lifestyle, might say they were rather strange.  But diffences are neither right nor wrong.  They are just different -- nothing more and nothing less.     We have been encouraged to share some of our experiences.  Hence, what you see is what you get.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His teachings were noted down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses. Philosophy, Epictetus taught, is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are determined by fate, and are thus beyond our control, but we can accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. Individuals, however, are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power. As part of the universal city that is the universe, human beings have a duty to care for all fellow humans. The person who follows these precepts will achieve happiness and peace of mind.", "related": ["B0067BDG6Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a roller coaster of a voyage, running the gamut of emotions. Her lovely poem 'Island Girl' could only have been written by a woman who has suffered a great deal and overcome much, and many of her other poems are equally moving. But that is not to discount the eclectic range of her subjects  -  war, family (especially children), nature and more. Bobby's love of her garden (who could fail to be amused by the 'blowsy tart' of a Morning Glory?!) and of birds  -  herons, swans and Henry the canary especially  -  make a lasting impression. I have no idea how many of the poems that seared into my consciousness were autobiographical but many I believe must be the result of observation and compassion. She possesses a rare ability enlighten us on her own journey toward the light.\" Sally Gardner, Author of Lilian's Story  \"Through her words, Bobbie searches and explores the emotions and vagaries of life and brings them, to us, the reader to share. Poems that span birth to the passing on of life, with double meanings and parallels, there is depth in many of the pieces, whilst others play it straight down the line - Bobbie writes from her heart, none more so than the poem 'White Flowers' with the innocence of children slighted by war; a poem that will find a place in the reader's heart too. Like the seasons of life, Bobbie relates beautifully the seasons of nature, a great love of hers, and this comes through strongly and with fondness, as in the poem 'Swan Flotilla'  -  where the author ponders 'what are they thinking?' A question I have often asked myself! Do not be afraid, there is humour in its pages too! For what would life be like without it? Many women will relate to 'Wash Day Greens' and for the boys 'Football Commentators will raise a smile! Christmas, when all of the passing year is celebrated and emotions come to the fore, is sprinkled through the book and needs no apologies for being there, for Bobbie captures this often turbulent time with pure honesty. Honesty sums up 'Finding the Light' beautifully, for its author could be nothing else.\" Jan Hedger, Author of Words in Imagination and On Calico Wings  \"I have known Bobbie for many years and she has always been such a compassionate and thoughtful woman. However, after the initial shock when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, she focused her thoughts on others who were perhaps experiencing the same reactions as her. Here is a problem, as much social as medical, to those of us who don't understand. Bobbie, through her poetry, has given us a valuable insight into the unique thoughts and observations of fellow sufferers, trying to get us to understand that the mind is as sharp as ever only the body is losing its grip. They are not invisible. I particularly like: A Christmas Story - very topical and full of hope. Remember This - the feeling of dark desperation is palpable but it won't stop people repeating their mistakes. The Woman in the Picture - seems to cry from the heart. Her body is not responding but she must not be written off as lost. Twilight Zone - how alone you feel when you don't fit in, as you think. These are but four of these lovely poems and there are many more to enjoy and make you think. Bobbie has done so well to make us all question our reactions to situations out of our comfort zone and to think how we can better help those, spiritually and physically, who perhaps we've ignored through our own inadequacies, not theirs. Well done Bobbie - a truly enjoyable and inspirational experience.\" Shirley Ritchie, December 2010", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Perhaps the most valuable contribution this book makes to the field of applied statistics is its impressive collection of equivalence testing procedures. … Of all the additions in the current edition, testing for relevant differences stands out as a rational and widely applicable methodology that is underutilized by most applied statisticians. The author provides a very convincing argument for why this methodology is more appropriate than testing for statistically significant differences in the majority of scientific applications. … the book is well written … very important book in the field of statistical hypothesis testing.\"—David Burt,Pharmaceutical Statistics, 2013\"This book will clearly be an extremely valuable practical guide for researchers faced with such problems, and would also provide a good introduction to anyone new to the special challenges of equivalence and noninferiority testing.\"—David J. Hand,International Statistical Review, 2012\"This book provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the topic and hence, I strongly believe, would be a valuable reference work for a library, and for both applied statisticians who need to deal with equivalence problems and researchers in statistics. Although this is not an introductory textbook, a lot of the material could be used in introductory inference courses. Senior and graduate statistical students would also benefit from exposure to the topic of the book.\"—Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 53(1), 2011\"The author made a thorough revision by adding new chapters on equivalence tests for multivariate data. … The strength of the book is that it includes numerous worked-out examples to illustrate the suggested methodologies.\"—Technometrics, February 2011\"The update is timely and includes some material on new subjects as well as updates of material presented in the original edition. … this book deserves a place on the bookshelf of the library of every pharmaceutical company. … this book remains the standard for texts on equivalence studies. The addition of information on non-inferiority analyses is welcome. A copy of this book should be available to every statistician who works on clinical trials.\"—Brian Wiens, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, Issue 3, 2011Praise for the First Edition:One of the \"Top Five Books for Statisticians\" by theJASA/TASReview Editor—Amstat News, The Membership Magazine of the American Statistical Association, September 2003\"The main value of the book is in its rather comprehensive and explicit treatment of various tests for equivalence problems. The book is very carefully written and mathematically correct … applied (bio-)statisticians may find this book a helpful manual for various testing procedures in the field of equivalence testing. These procedures are very carefully described and are accompanied by SAS of Fortran code. More mathematically oriented readers may regard this book as a good source of examples, and the thorough discussion of relevant practical questions in the field might stimulate them to doing further research in this area.\"—Journal of the American Statistical Association, March 2004\"The book is well organized for the applied statistician with an interest in the theoretical background for statistical procedures. What is especially useful about this book for the applied statistician is that the author weaves into the presentation of the equivalence tests, discussions of power, and sample size as well as simulation results that evaluate the small sample properties of the tests. In addition, a location on the World Wide Web where one can find SAS programs to facilitate the implementation of these tests is provided … Wellek has provided a text on equivalence testing that the applied statistician will find useful both as a theory underlying equivalence testing as well as a source of equivalence tests and tools for their implementation for a wide variety of situations.\"—Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics\"… a thorough and wide-ranging exposition of statistical methods for the testing of hypotheses of equivalence … The content of the book and the presentation of the material are praiseworthy for several reasons. Throughout the book, the focus is on optimal tests … . Where exact methods are not available, asymptotically equivalent tests are presented. The small sample behaviour, both size and power, of asymptotic tests is thoroughly studied through simulation. This must have been an enormous amount of work, but the effort certainly was not in vain; one is convinced that one can apply the methods presented with confidence. Even more deserving of praise is the fact that computer programs (mostly in SAS language) implementing various tests and power calculations are provided … In summary, this is an excellent book and strongly recommended. It is required reading for all biostatisticians and developers of statistical software who work in this arena. It will be useful when teaching statistical test theory and in practice. …\"—Robert Schall,Clinical Trials,2004\"… this book provides the reader with the opportunity to do equivalence testing for various statistical problems.

The poetry in the book and the placement of the poems work perfectly, I think, and it was brilliant to place the re-worked epic battle description in the middle; it strikes just the right tone there. And I was very moved by the final poem. The greatest poetry in the book--for me--is the description and experience of the world of the dead. I love the variety of the supporting cast. the blend of elements in Perril and March are really delightful. I so enjoy him and, as he struts by, so want to kick him where the boot toe best aims.

As a student working a part-time job, president of a student organization, frequenter of local establishments, and typical crazy college male, he has limited time to squeeze in for his writing pursuits. Usually this means picking up the laptop in between classes, during breaks at work, or other moments of solitude that he makes time for at least twice a day. It’s not much but it gets the job done.  Josh began writing when he was a kid. Growing up in an Air Force home he had lots of time to devote to creative outlets. The two main outlets he found was music and of course, writing. The first he drew from his grandfather who passed on his musical passion to him and drove him to pursue playing the guitar which he has done since he was twelve. Writing, however, grew from just a desire to let out everything swirling around in his head. Always the imaginative one, his words began to flow and his stories took form. He began writing when he was eight years old, chronicling various adventures he would have with his friends, by high school his writing was influenced by things going on in his life and events that took place. In college, however, is when his writing really took off. Upon discovering the world of politics, he began combining his imaginative side with his passion for political issues and began writing various satire pieces. That then morphed into fiction with a political emphasis in various areas as well as dabbling in other genres just for fun. With such a broad mind his ideas and stories had limitless possibilities.  He decided to write a novel in summer of 2011, after debating ideas for a while he found out about the National Novel Writing Month and thought what better chance. He went for the challenge to write fifty thousand words in one month. After dealing with setbacks, term papers, tests, and writer’s block, he pulled off the final sprint on November 27th. After editing and finalizing the work he published it and now it's in your hand.  Josh accredits much of his drive for all his pursuits to his family and friends that have supported him. From the family that supported him through college, to his friends that volunteered their names for characters, to his buddies that invited him downtown for a night of relieving the stress from writing, to…well let’s not get too personal, they all helped him in some way or another.", "related": [], "rank": 3881559, "title": "Rome Burned In A Few Hours", "author": "Joshua Rivers", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I thought I had things figured out and then realized I didn't. As the book progresses, Bryant pulls it all together and the ending left me wanting more. It was an amazing cliffhanger. ~Page Turners Blog*Rated Marvelous*Immortal Souls is an awesome book which sucked me right in to the story world Molly Bryant has created and keep me up all night reading it.Immortal Souls is very well written and was a total pleasure to read from the amazing characters to the plot that had an edge you don't normaly find in YA which is one of the main reasons that I found myself loving it so much. Molly Bryant didn't shy away from writing about sex and abuse and told of it in a tasteful way when I find other YA books mostly avoid these topic's. ~YA Indie Princess ( Queen of all things YA) *4.5 STARSImmortal Souls is fantastic! The story plot is promising and new and it's nice to see something different! I got emotional at some parts and when I get emotional, that is a very good sign! For your first book Molly, it is great! Very promising! I have to say this... I can see your story going far my friend! ~Author Amie LynLike a fine tapestry, Molly took various strands within her young adult tale and artfully wove them together to produce a suspenseful fictional plot filled with action, humor, mystery, drama, as well as love, while continually luring her audience to want to know more. As the story progressed I became wrapped up with the mystery of a past love that lived on beyond death and time, to resurface in a most unusual way and a surprise ending.  This is a story that won't be easy to put down until  the last page is completed. ~Author Kathy Goodhew", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Upon my return, I joined an advertising agency, and began a successful career that spanned many many years. In addition to being an award-winning copywriter, I developed marketing skills that led to my becoming an independent consultant. In my spare time, I dabbled as a toy inventor and developed two product lines that met with tremendous success. Then, after a long bout with cancer, my life went from the relatively ordinary to the extraordinary when I had my afterlife experiences.

Though the family has been penniless and has shuffled from one cramped apartment to another since Mr. Cornwallis's death, 11-year-old Binny balks at living in the house because the late Violet gave away Binny's beloved dog. Binny's deceased nemesis, with whom she has imaginary conversations, becomes an unlikely catalyst for the girl's salvation; after the move, Binny finds much-needed friends in the angry, lonely boy next door; a handsome older boy who lets her join the crew on his boat; and Kate, a kindly cafe owner. While Binny's engaging relationships with these characters is a bonus, the humorous and poignant interactions among Binny's caring older sister, independent younger brother, and insightful mother are the heart of the novel. Player's brassy b&w; illustrations sit a bit oddly against McKay's elegant and often dreamlike prose, but it's a minor off note in a well-crafted story that balances moments of hilarity with poignancy.

Just like you I spend many hours engrossed within the pages of my latest read.   I love reading all types of genre, ranging from non-fiction/informational books to fantasy/action-adventure/romance novels.  Books allow me to learn, find solutions, and (when needed) escape into an alternate reality for a few hours. I have always had a fondness for writing, but it was not until very recently that I took the risk to put action behind the dream. I am very proud to provide to you Spirit 101.

Matson has studied martial arts most of his life, from wrestling, European fencing, and boxing, to karate and jujutsu. His formal study of karate started in January of 1999 in the Collin County Community College (now Collin College) self-defense program taught by Brody Burns. At the end of the semester he had decided that someday he would have Mr. Burns’ job or one like his, so he joined Sensei Burns’ dojo. Within 2 years he was assisting in classes at the dojo and some off-site programs. In 2002 he was awarded an assistant instructor’s certificate, the title of Senpai, from Brody Burns and Darrin Free. He continued to train, compete and assist in the teaching of programs at the Academy of Classical Karate-do.   Mr. Matson earned his black belt, from the Academy of Classical and the WIKF (Wado International Karate-Do federation) in 2006. In the fall of 2007 Sensei Burns asked Mr. Matson to teach at Collin College.  In his time at Collin College Mr. Matson has taught Karate, Self-Defense, Cardio Kickboxing credit courses, as well as Kickboxing and Pilates wellness, non-credit, classes.  He has competed and traveled around the United States and the world for karate.  In 2001 he started working at 24-Hour Fitness. There he earned several training certifications from the National Academy of Sports Medicine and other organizations. Mr. Matson managed a couple of clubs for 24-Hour Fitness as an assistant fitness manager and as a fitness manager. In 2006 he went back to school, and earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Sports Management, Health and Wellness in 2008 and then a Masters in Sports Performance and Injury Prevention in 2009 from California University of Pennsylvania.  He has 12+ certifications/licenses and continues to further his education in the field of sports performance, athletic training and coaching.  In 2008 Mr. Matson earned an assistant instructor license from Tatsuo Suzuki Hanshi. In 2009 he earned his second-degree black belt.  All of Mr. Matson’s dan certificates and teaching licenses in karate have come from Suzuki Hanshi, up until Suzuki Hanshi’s death in 2011. Mr. Matson continually trains in both Wado Ryu karate and Shindo Yoshin Ryu as much as he can. He is at the dojo teaching and training almost every day.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is the question Dr. Allison La Crosse must ask herself every time she gives in to her compulsion to save people who are near death. By saving them, she agrees to take on their every symptom... even if those symptoms could kill her.Journey with Allison as she learns about her ability, falls in love, almost dies, and endures heartbreak. There is no stone left unturned when it comes to the trials and tribulations she must endure. Every one of them more unbelievable than the other and more exhilarating to read.As the author of this unique, genre-crossing, series, I can tell you there's a little bit of everything (from paranormal to fantasy to thriller to action to jaw-dropping romance) embedded within Warriors of the Cross, Guardians of the Cross, and Enemies of the Cross. They are all filled with enough page-turning excitement to keep the reader going until the very last page of Enemies of the Cross. At which time, the reader will be begging for a quicker release date for Dark Angels of the Cross.T. R.

However, by the time she reached her turbulent adolescent years, fate interceded, altering her childhood dreams. At the ripe old age of 18-years-old, Keisha became a casualty of teen pregnancy. Her literary career would be a dream deferred. Refusing to become a victim of circumstance, Keisha was forced to buckle down and re-analyze the direction of her life. Accepting motherhood as a blessing in disguise rather than a curse, she was forced to mature. Realizing she had another life depending on her for survival, Keisha cleaned up her act, severing her street ties and making the successful transition to motherhood and author.

DOCTORS SHOULD KNOW YOUR DIAGNOSIS!\"It's driven me crazy over the last ten years that the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (which has NO set diagnostic criteria!!) is often made when it's really JUST pituitary dysfunction (damaged pituitary) and all that means. Fifty (50) years ago this diagnosis would have been made -- when doctors KNEW how to use their stethoscopes, their wits, and their brains to make PROPER diagnosis. This problem now occurs because of the facts that 1) there are very few PITUITARY endocrinologists (true gods of medicine) in the world (maybe 10 in the USA), and 2) all the other endocrinologists out there are \"below-the-neck\" and just not \"hard educated\" in pituitary care, and 3) big pharma has taken advantage of this ignorance in the medical community and filled the hole with various medicines (actually designed to give untreated pituitary patients) that comfort and relief UNTIL they can get properly diagnosed. Trouble is NO ONE ever gets the rest of the diagnosis -- your pituitary is hammered!So I look at the literature and the research and show you how to deal with this properly. If it's YOU with the \"fibromyalgia\" (is that even a real diagnosis?), then I guide you in how to get treated as properly as you can for your pituitary dysfunction and get relief and therapy as best you can in manner most beneficial to you.Good luck and know my prayers are with you.", "related": ["B00FATVV90"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His teaching career has included time working in rural Sweden, a sojourn that first sparked his now enduring interest in Scandinavian history and culture - an interest that after many years of research, both academic and in the field, led him to write Finn's Fate and the sequel novel, Three Kings, One Throne.  Today, Michael works part-time as Ombudsman for the National Association of English Language Providers. Though a lot of his spare time is spent with grandchildren, he also has a wide range of interests including researching for future books, writing, playing the guitar, carpentry and electronics.

This is an outstanding study deserving of a wide readership. -- Professor Chris Phillipson, School of Social Sciences, The University of Manchester, UK. This innovative book provides a carefully crafted, rich and sophisticated account of the interplay between bodily and cultural aging through the lens of fashion and dress for older women. Fashion and Age explores central questions in contemporary culture, including how dress plays a significant part in the constitution of identities. By weaving empirical research with a breadth of theoretical ideas, this agenda-setting book is essential reading within ageing, gender, and consumption studies. -- Professor Sara Arber, Centre for Research on Ageing and Gender (CRAG), University of Surrey, UK. Age studies makes a heady, liberating move into fashion with Julia Twigg's smart and entertaining book. Focusing her research on the intersections of feminism, cheap consumables, and women's individualized development of their own look in relation to \"appropriateness,\" Twigg can explain how it is that (in spite of fashion's cult of youth), many more women of a certain age are finally dressing without pain. -- Margaret Morganroth Gullette, author of Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America and Resident Scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center, Brandeis University, USA. Fashion and Age is a path-breaking book on the neglected topic of how later life and clothing function in today's society. Julia Twigg shows how older women, the media and the High Street all interact to create our understanding of both ageing and dress. In doing so, Julia Twigg has produced a key text for those interested in the operation of the fashion industry as well as those seeking to understand the links between the personal narratives of ageing and the contemporary nature of embodiment. Fashion and Age provides plenty of food for thought for students and researchers alike and is a valuable addition to the cultural sociology of ageing. -- Paul Higgs, Professor of the Sociology of Ageing, Faculty of Brain Sciences University College London, UK. [A] fascinating discussion of what happens to our sense of fashion as we reach later life. As [Twigg] puts it, \"age is not just peripheral to fashion but positively erosive of it\". Drawing on interviews with those who wear, sell and write about fashion, Twigg addresses a range of questions about how we negotiate fashion as we get older...This book is a welcome addition to an expanding field...The author's grasp of the nuances of interpretation of fashion, dress and clothing is excellent. -- Cheryl Buckley, Northumbria University Times Higher Education Supplement 20130919 We're all Fabulous Fashionistas now, if the press is to be believed. The baby boomers, who wore Biba and Mary Quant, are opting for the same colourful styles as their daughters. Yet this simplistic view is about to be challenged by Julia Twigg, professor of sociology at the University of Kent and author of Fashion and Age, an academic study of dress and later life. -- Anne Karpf The Guardian 20131104", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Before he started writing novels, Toby worked as a technical writer for the government and in the private sector, edited romance and paranormal romance novels in the freelance sector, and designed board and card games in the close friends sector. He is the author of several forthcoming novels in the science fiction and young adult genres, and he's sure to write at least one amazing screenplay, and probably some really bad ones. You can find him on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Xbox Live, and the PlayStation Network, but don't believe a word you read or hear about him. You can't trust anything you find online, especially in e-books. Toby is a Tennessee native and graduate of Eastern Kentucky University's Creative Writing program. So please send all complaints or kudos to the State of Tennessee and the EKU English and Theater Department. They love reading both. Toby is currently living in Sydney, Australia with his wife and their two food babies. But it's only a matter of time until he gets them all deported. Truly.

This experience of enlightenment and ego death in a lucid dream set his life on an irreversible course of profound investigation of spiritual truth. No longer could he be content to just live life as it appeared to be on the surface. He was forced by destiny to get to the root of his suffering. After chasing gurus and studying various forms of yoga and meditation, he settled down as a serious student of Buddhist Vipassana (Insight) meditation under the tutelage of Ven. Shinzen Young. He stayed with that discipline for 7 years, meditating without fail one to two hours a day. As part of this discipline of body-sweeping meditation, he also went on several 10 day meditation retreats. Eventually, even though the practice had been rewarding, he found himself needing something else. He didn't know what it was, but when he met the Advaita guru Ramesh Balsekar, he knew that he had found it. In the late 1980s, he asked Ramesh a question about meditation. Ramesh's answer was \"There is nothing you can do.\" His seeking burned out to the point of being a burden, this was precisely what he needed to hear. Ramesh's words acted like a surgical strike, shattering the accumulation of decades of spiritual seeking into tiny fragmented bits. A few years later, while meditating on his living room couch, Ramaji experienced the sudden flash of awakening. He soon realized that he could not find himself, meaning the separate entity that had identified with the body. He also quickly discovered that he was no longer the \"doer.\" He now lived spontaneously, at one with the joyful and playful Tao of Life. After many years of living in voluntary obscurity, Ramaji decided to come forward as a public teacher and give Satsang. He lives in San Diego and makes himself available in person and via phone and Skype to seekers and students around the world. Because of his special interest in and understanding of Divine Mother and Kundalini, many of his students have a background of devotion to Kali and Kundalini experiences. He gives an awakening transmission he calls RASA (Ramaji Advaita Satsang Attunement). This attunement opens the crown chakra to facilitate the enlightenment of the meditator. It is given over Skype or in person in San Diego, California. We live in times where enlightenment is easier to achieve than ever before.

McFarland takes us away from the usual talking animal story and into a crazy race to catch a laptop. Cat's computer was running slow so he asks Duck to make it run faster. Duck inserts a thumb drive and that gives the laptop arms and legs. Before long, the laptop is racing away, only to scare off all of Duck's cows.McFarland takes the reader on a fun journey as the laptop gets around, only to be caught by the alpacas, who are busy using the laptop to shop on eBay. The timing and metering make this a nice story to read aloud, and one that would be enjoyed by preschoolers, kindergarteners, first and second graders, and adults. It's a story that you won't grow weary of reading aloud to a youngster.McFarland wrote the story so that even if a child has yet to know what eBay is, the concept that it's a shopping website is clear. Added to the unique and clever story are remarkable illustrations. The drawings are amazing and they certainly add to the story. They are well placed and bring out the humor of the plot. The concept of the story is unique. It will leave children (and adults) laughing as the adventurous laptop escapes. Parents and teachers will enjoy the story because it's not simply another talking animal book and the timing is good for reading aloud. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining children's story.", "related": ["B00AHRE74G"], "rank": 1748631, "title": "Duck and Friends: The Computer Chase", "author": "Donna Gielow McFarland", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

He gave me the wonderful chance to live with Him as His student in school and University. He blessed me with the good sense to write down the happenings during my student life on a daily basis. Finally, He also gave me His word that the more I share about Him, the more I shall receive from Him. That was the inspiration for me to start blogging actively , which I continue to do at aravindb1982.hubpages.com and ataravindb1982.blogspot.in.Very often I received mails and messages from several readers asking me why I wouldn't write a book. I am convinced that it was Swami through so many readers who instructed and inspired me to compile the articles into this book. It is He who is present in every page of this book just as He is in every page of the book of my life. I am also grateful to Him for sending me a host of His instruments to make this intimate book, a reality.My wife Pooja Aravind Digumarti and Sai-sister Shalu Chandiramani helped to go through the book and make the text error free and grammatically right. My sister and best critic, Shruti Mahadevan, was there to give suggestions on every aspect of the book. My brother Amey Deshpande has been an integral part of the narratives in this book and he has been an inspiration for me in both, storytelling and loving Swami. My colleagues C G Sai Prakash and Ajish Mohan helped in designing a beautiful cover for the book for which Jaidev Kesavan did the page layout. It was Sai-brother Nitin Acharya who enthusiastically took up the project of getting the book printed by the Books and Publications division of the Sri Sathya Sai Sadhana Trust.I would be doing a grave mistake if I forget to mention the inspiration my parents have been for me - not only in writing about Swami, but also in guiding me to hold on to His feet throughout my life.Last but not the least, I must thank you, dear reader, for what is a book without a reader? Your thoughts and feelings are most valuable to me and I consider the reader's feedback and mail as messages to me from my Swami.

With eye-popping plot twists and rollicking good action,Half a Kingis definitely a full adventure.”—Rick Riordan “Enthralling! An up-all-night read.”—Robin Hobb “Polished and sharp, perhaps his most technically proficient novel yet . . . I dare you to read the first chapter and try not to turn the next page.”—Brent Weeks “Half a Kingcan be summed up in a single word: masterpiece. It’s a coming-of-age story. It’s a Viking saga. It’s a revenge tale and family drama and the return of the prodigal son. But most of all, it’s this: a short time alongside people as weak and blundering as we are and, in the midst of it all, as heroic. Far too short a time, as it turns out.

Later, as a teenager, she started sketching her teachers as well as her cats (the latter definitely being the more fascinating personalities).       After some years working as an assistant director in the theatre and musical business Barbara is currently working as a copywriter in advertising.       This summer, at the summer academy on the Greek island of Zakynthos, she suddenly felt inspired to draw cartoons again. During a stay in Istanbul in November, Barbara decided to produce this picture book about cats in Istanbul.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He loves baffling the minds of his friends with stories, and specializes in keeping the reader guessing through the entire book.     Philip started working on The War of all Times in April 2013 during his sophomore year of college. Currently he is in his junior year of college and studying to become an elementary school teacher. He loves all sports and enjoys doing crazy and sometimes embarrassing things with friends. He loves creating games, telling stories, and coming up with weird activities that most people enjoy. He has a fiery passion for the LORD and wishes only that his works would reveal Christ's love to those who do not believe.    As a sequel to the first book, Philip’s inspiration for The War of all Times, was to continue the original story while adding new tricks and refining the old. Plot-twists are his favorite tool, which he uses nearly every chapter to urge the reader on and keep them guessing. For the first time, he has felt that his writing ability and knowledge is sufficient to make complex and realistic characters while also capturing the reader’s imagination and sucking them deep into the story.    His hopes for this book are that his readers would be inspired to selflessly stand for what’s right and good like Oren, be as wise and justice-seeking as Jay, and to stay true to their promises and loyal to those around them like Jerol. Though the author does not expect his readers to be forced to make decisions that will decide the fate of the world, he does hope that this story will show his readers the importance of seeking the truth and educating themselves to make wise decisions in both small and big decisions. Most of all, he hopes this novel will help his readers see the sacrifice of our savior Jesus Christ (represented by Oren), and search for the hidden enemy that threatens the destruction of all.

That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B.

T. Weaver is the pen name of a Kansas City grandmother of ten. She lives with her cat, Cleopatra, in downtown Kansas City, MO.

In 2003, through a TV show called Boy Meets Boy, A.T ‘met’ over 3,000 gay men in a Yahoo group. These men educated her as to the inequalities suffered by the LGBT community and she became a staunch ally. She visited one of the men in San Francisco who lived just up the street from the Castro. As he showed her around, they stopped in front of what was once Harvey Milk’s camera store. Her question, “Who was Harvey Milk?” started her education into Gay history. A. T.’s aim is to move you in some way. Whether you laugh or cry, love it or hate it, she welcomes all comments, whether good or bad.", "related": ["B00IRBXJNE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book gave me a new perspective on life, and I feel that I can be a better person than what I was before.\" -by Dino Javier\"It's interesting that so many emotional problems, mental health problems, and personality disorders boil down to an inner sense that you are not good enough somehow. This book provides wonderful advise on how to overcome this crippling notion.

I think anyone could benefit from reading this book!\" -by Anne\"Love Yourself-Heal Yourself is a self-help guide worth reading.

It adds to the value of this book and useful strategies for you to apply. I like chapter three in particular, about challenging your fears.

Not only does Janine learn about the hardships and heartbreak Vera faced as the daughter of an African-American servant and the son of a 'typical' Southern aristocrat in the 1950s, she recognizes the importance of acceptance and forgiveness. Janine struggles with her attitude towards other people and is surprisingly drawn to Vera, an old woman living on the street near where Janine works. Alternately captured and repulsed by Vera's story, Janine is continually pulled back, only to realize that she genuinely cares. Janine discovers that there are many types of love - some uplifting, some smothering - and that standing up to rejection or even just the fear of losing that love can be the most difficult thing to face....While the story is sad, even horrifying, it is ultimately uplifting and provides a ray of hope for those who can 'stop the movie' and make positive steps towards self-forgiveness.Reviewed By Melinda Hills for Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
