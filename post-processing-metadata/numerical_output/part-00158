Pressured to join the Nazi Party, she announced, \"I belong to the party of Jesus Christ.\"\"Tomorrow night your children will be taken from you unless you join the party,\" Herr Doering screamed. And she had another secret. One day the Gestapo knocked on her door. \"Are you hiding a Jew\" they demanded. Their chances of survival? Dim. Their only ally? God.In a few short years they lived several lifetimes of danger. As thousands around them fell victim to the horrors of war, they were borne up on angels' wings--sometimes quite literally.

Biondi presents postwar New York as a battleground, no less than the Jim Crow South, for the fight against police brutality and discrimination in employment, housing, retail stores, and places of amusement. Men and women, trade unionists and religious leaders, integrationists and separatists, liberals and the Left come together in this pathbreaking study of America's largest and most cosmopolitan city. (Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, editor-in-chief ofThe Harvard Guide to African-American History)To Stand and Fightbrilliantly re-writes the history of postwar social movements in New York City. Martha Biondi has not only extended our view of the civil rights movement to the urban North, but she places the movement squarely within an international framework. She redefines the movement, focusing on the specific struggles that mattered: jobs, welfare, housing, police misconduct, political representation, and black people's ongoing battle for independence in the colonies.To Stand and Fightwill stand out as a major contribution to an already burgeoning field of civil rights studies. (Robin D. G. Kelley, author ofFreedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination)To Stand and Fightestablishes that New York was as important a battleground for racial equality as Montgomery or Birmingham. Martha Biondi has done a great service by uncovering the rich and largely forgotten history of New York's role in the African American freedom struggle. (Thomas J. Sugrue, author ofThe Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit)Historians have thoroughly documented the experiences of those African Americans who lived in the South and worked to repeal Jim Crow laws. However, in this work, Biondi explores what she calls 'the struggle for Negro rights' in New York City, an exploration resulting in a stark reminder of the daily challenges facing blacks who lived in northern cities...With its detailed discussions of the American Labor Party, the Communist Party, Black Nationalism, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., W. E. B. Dubois, Roy Wilkins, and, especially, Paul Robeson, this work should be required reading for all historians interested in the post-WW II experience of African Americans in the urban North. (T. D. BealChoice2004-01-01)In this meticulously researched monograph, Biondi reminds the reader that the struggle for black civil rights was waged in the North before it was joined in the South. She documents the fight against racial discrimination in hiring, police brutality, housing segregation, lack of political representation, and inadequate schools in New York City between 1946 and 1954...Biondi's writing is crisp and direct. She introduces the reader to a host of activists whose efforts deserve to be remembered. Unfortunately, most of the causes they championed remain with us today. (Paul T. MurrayMultiCultural Review2004-05-01)By examining the fight for equality in New York...Biondi...contribute[s] further to our understanding of race in America, in general, and the nature and course of the civil rights movement, more specifically. (Peter B. LevyJournal of American Ethnic History2005-05-01)Martha Biondi...has written a scathing critique of the polities of anti-Communism—not just its often-paranoid fantasies and rights violations. Biondi powerfully argues that the damaging legacy of anti-Communism lies in the ways it crippled a vision for a more just and equal New York City, and, by extension, the nation by destroying the careers of many of its most visionary citizens. Biondi’sTo Stand and Fight: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Postwar New Yorkjoins an emerging body of scholarship that overturns the Southern focus of Civil Rights history. Biondi takes us to New York—the home of the largest black community in the nation and, like its more notorious Southern counterparts, segregated in housing, schools, and most public and private accommodations. Biondi powerfully unravels hard and fast distinctions between Northern and Southern racism. Through an examination of numerous incidences of police brutality against African Americans in postwar NYC, the chapter on Northern lynching is a stark reminder of the state-sanctioned violence that ensured Northern segregation and inequality. (Jeanne TheoharisLeft History)Biondi's book makes the counterintuitive point that the modern civil rights movement began in the north, not in the south. It did not begin with the Montgomery bus boycott; it did not begin with the Supreme Court desegregation decision of 1954. In the aftermath of World War II, the civil rights movement came alive in northern cities. She focuses on New York City. Biondi highlights the moment when racial egalitarianism became a core element of modern liberalism. It wasn't before. In the 1930s Roosevelt worked closely with racist, segregationist Southern Democrats who controlled important committees. He needed them to get measures through Congress. In other words, you could be a good New Deal liberal and be a total racist. Many liberals were racial egalitarians but many liberals were racists. Views on race were not part of the definition of liberalism. Today you can't be a racist and a liberal.

Nowhere is this complex, wonderful, and sometimes dark part of us more clearly revealed than in “Connected”. In a social world exploding with new ways to interact, “Connected” is a user’s guide for ourselves in the 21st century.’ Dan Ariely, bestselling author of ‘Predictably Irrational’‘Christakis and Fowler have written THE book on the exciting new science of social networks. With passion and precision, these two internationally renowned scientists expose the invisible webs that connect each of us to the other, and in so doing cast our lives here together in an astonishing new light. We think we are individuals who control our own fates, but as Christakis and Fowler demonstrate, we are merely cells in the nervous system of a much greater beast. If someone you barely know reads “Connected”, it could change your life forever. How? Read it yourself and find out.’ Daniel Gilbert, bestselling author of ‘Stumbling on Happiness’‘This wonderful book by Christakis and Fowler could well be one of the most important works of the decade. In a clear and engaging way, the authors apply their creative and provocative findings on social networks to understanding not only our social relationships but also the forces that shape our world. Full of fascinating stories and examples, this book is essential in understanding our very nature. A must read.’ Ed Diener, author of ‘Happiness’‘Margaret Thatcher said there is no such thing as society. Hillary Clinton wrote that it takes a village. In their new book, Christakis and Fowler write, “We don’t live in groups, we live in networks,” and they back this up with dozens of interconnected stories of research findings by themselves and others, ranging from bank runs to suicide prevention, from nut allergies among schoolchildren to epidemics in virtual worlds, from the spread of happiness to the spread of voting.

Deeply researched, smartly argued, and engagingly written,Selling Soundswill sweep you off your feet. (Lizabeth Cohen, author ofA Consumers' Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America)Selling Soundsmasterfully charts the rise of the modern music industry in all its commercial complexity. As engaging as the new popular music Suisman  describes, his account deserves an audience as wide as that music enjoyed. (Emily Thompson, author ofThe Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America, 1900-1933)Ranging from Tin Pan Alley song pluggers to Supreme Court decisions on copyright, from Caruso's Victor Red Seal records to Black Swan, the first major black-owned record company, David Suisman'sSelling Soundsis a marvelous cultural history of the ways the music industry retuned the soundscape of modern times in the United States. (Michael Denning, Yale University)Virgin's music emporium will soon become a thing of the past: Like so many other retail music stores of late, it has announced that it is going out of business. The story ofSelling Sounds, then, is especially timely. (Ken EmersonWall Street Journal2009-05-12)A fascinating, well-written, richly detailed story of how music became a commodity in America...[Suisman's] scholarship is amazingly wide-ranging. (William F. GavinWashington Times2009-06-03)[It's a] fascinating narrative that David Suisman unfurls...Here you learn everything from how the work of creating the songs is distributed to the various sales techniques employed by song pluggers (basically, the salesmen of music publishing), including the use of slides to add a visual component to the song. While there are numerous accounts of the position of so-called song pluggers in the development of popular music in the first decades of the 20th century, one rarely encounters a description that so accurately and compellingly details the quotidian life of these remarkable salesmen and the ways in which they learned to compete while peacefully coexisting...This [is a] really wonderful book. It warrants repeated readings and deep consideration. It is full of surprising revelations and some truly hilarious anecdotes. Well-researched and beautifully documented, replete with beautiful illustrations and photographs, this book belongs on the shelf of any reader serious about popular music and the music industry and given the impact of that industry on our daily lives, that really ought to be all of us. (Chadwick JenkinsPopMatters2009-06-19)Suisman...tell[s] an alluring story. (George AndersForbes.com2009-07-07)A fascinating new book about the formative history of the American music business. (Matt MillerThe Deal Magazine2009-07-15)Inventors ran wild during the years bracketing the turn of the 20th century, creating technology that repeatedly transformed the ways people heard and consumed music. It happened again a hundred years later, which makes David Suisman's lucid account of the emergence and consolidation of the music industry particularly welcome. (Grant AldenWilson Quarterly2009-06-01)[A] meticulously researched history of [the music industry's] early days. (Mark AthitakisWashington Post2009-08-23)Though the story Suisman tells is a broadly familiar one, he has assembled valuable reminders of something many would rather ignore; namely, the extent to which the music we hear, and how we hear it, has less to do with our personal preferences than with what a large, well-organized sector of business makes available to us. Most listeners--and, I'd wager, artists--would surely prefer to see their musical experiences as a respite from capitalism, not a function of it. Still, it would be hard to deny that phenomena from the selling of youth culture back to itself in the form of rock and roll to the rise of ringtones as a tiny, publicly audible lifestyle indicator (and a fresh income stream) are rooted in structures and processes whose origins Suisman describes. (Franklin BrunoLos Angeles Times blog2009-09-15)WithSelling Sounds, David Suisman kicks the legs out from the romantic account of the music industry's innocent start and slow move to commercial heartlessness. Suisman investigates the early decades of the popular music industry, from 1880 to 1930, and his descriptions of the upstart crews of scrappy entrepreneurs who hawked sheet music in the old days call to mind the corporate suits at major labels plugging the next Disney-spawned tween star or mall punk band. Put it in a pretty package and the kids will go ape for it. For Suisman popular music has always been heavily commercialized (songs, albums and artists are just more widgets to be peddled), and his book leaves one wondering whether the history of commercial music resembles the aesthetics of the pop song: the pattern has little variation but has proved to be endlessly repeatable, and mostly profitable. (J. Gabriel BoylanThe Nation2010-01-11)If you're interested in the history of the music industry, or have wondered idly how the song that's stuck in your head got to be there, you should read David Suisman's detailed and entertainingSelling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music. Every page held a new discovery for me, from the competitive world of song pluggers (piano-and-crooner teams hired to perform songs in advance of the sheet music publication, often to \"spontaneous\" applause from plants in the audience), to the rise of the player-piano (in 1900, it would have been regarded as more potentially culture-transforming than phonographs), to the reason tenors surpassed sopranos in popularity (their voices better masked deficiencies in early recording), to Irving Berlin's nine rules--some seemingly contradictory--to writing a hit song. The chapter on Black Swan Records alone, which from 1921 to 1923 attempted to combine racial uplift with a viable business model, is worth the price of admission.Selling Soundsis a profound and fascinating book, not just for academics but for anyone with ears.

Oren's father, a retired judge, is convinced they belong to Josh, Oren's 15-year-old brother, who vanished in the woods when Oren was 17. The town abounds in rumors as well as suspects, from a disfigured and reclusive ex-LAPD officer to a once beautiful hotel owner who may have had an affair with teenage Oren. When a grave is discovered in the woods, Oren is surprised that the broken bones belong not only to Josh but to an unknown woman. Determined to solve his brother's murder, Oren must face his own past and the real possibility that the killer might strike again. O'Connell's characters are complex as always, but she often suffocates them under unnecessary red herrings.

He sees aesthetic experience as rooted in idealization of early attachment of the infant to his mother. In the present work he expands his ingenious formulations to Modern art which encourages personal idiosyncrasies, subjective expression, and aggressive abandonment of tradition. In this thoughtful and well researched text, he illustrates his theory by a detailed examination of a number of well known painters including, Degas, Bonnard, Duchamp, Pollock and Warhol. The list is extensive enough to enrich our understanding and appreciation of varied and at times opposing attitudes towards the process of artistic creation.\" -Francis Baudry, New York Psychoanalytic Institute, USA\"The author's psychoanalytic readings of the eight artists are compelling like princesses in a fairy tale, each of whom is 'more beautiful than the last.'\" -Ellen Dissanayake, author of Art and IntimacyandHomo Aestheticus\"The Artist's Mindoffers a vitalizing, new analytic perspective on the importance of aesthetics and art as a 'dialogue with the world,' shedding light on the evolution of modern art through the lives and works of major 20th century artists, and expanding our understanding of art into the 21st century.\" -Carol M.

Arguing over a recent multimillion-dollar bequest, the faculty is divided into three camps, crudely labeled by Jack as \"Virgins, Dykes and Old Women.\" The first, the academics loyal to the presiding Mistress, are under attack by the Dykes, who, led by two women professors, want the money used for a Gender and Ethnic Studies Center. The Old Women are men, including a wimpy embroidery expert and a cleric, desiring nothing more than updated, cushy quarters. High feelings and hot words escalate. The Mistress is murdered, bringing the police, who are under the bumbling direction of a Bible-quoting ignoramus inspector totally at sea in this milieu. A second killing occurs before the inspector, with some quiet guidance from Amiss, makes an almost perfunctory arrest. Detection and suspense take a back seat to Edwards's (Clubbed to Death) acidly witty send-up of feminists, dumb cops and all matters politically correct.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0088OVJTQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes her sister, Carol, has been brutally murdered by her brother-in-law, Frank, despite how innocent he appears to the police. To Molly and Dr. Valerie Gartin of the Child Trauma Unit, there is a message hidden in Molly's traumatized young nephew Jack's painting: the \"painted bride\" as he calls it, is his mother--Carol--throat slit, bleeding on the kitchen floor. Dismissed from her job (is Frank behind that?) and in a \"dodgy\" borrowed Datsun, Molly sets out to gather evidence against Frank, taking Jack and his sister \"on holiday\" for their safety. Will police believe her interpretation of the painting? Will she protect the children and secure justice for Carol's death?

It's a great book, I recommend it. --goodreads.comDerek's review: ***** Five Stars I asked my Father in law, who by the way is in our local wards leadership, to take a look at it first and he took one day and said it is wonderful so far, a great book. He read about half already and told me it would be helpful to anyone wanting to know more about what we believe will come to take place during the second comming. Now I have plans to read the book but wanted to give what I believe is a more important review by letting him read it first as I go to him often with questions about scriptures.

Flavio Barbiero’s investigation of this strange absence and his study of the centuries-long power struggle between the priestly families fighting for control of the temple of Jerusalem starts with the rebellion against Rome--and the emergence of Josephus Flavius, one of Moses’s descendants, on the world stage. In AD 70 when the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus Flavius and thousands of Jewish priests were exterminated, Josephus, now bearing his sponsor’s last name, followed Titus Flavius to Rome with at least 250 relatives and friends. Here they were made Roman citizens but then subsequently disappeared from recorded history.Barbiero’s careful study of early Christianity shows, however, that these surviving members of Moses’s high-priest lineage succeeded in taking control of the nascent Roman Church and masterminded its extraordinary success. Using a wide range of evidence drawn from fields as disparate as archaeology, heraldry, and genetics, Barbiero shows how these descendants of Moses used the cult of Mithras to eventually seize control of the secular Roman authority as well. He then follows, step by step, the spread of the members of this secret priestly elite into what was to become the aristocracy of medieval Europe and how their influence continues to be felt in modern secret societies like Freemasonry.FLAVIO BARBIERO is a retired admiral in the Italian Navy who last served with NATO. He is the author of several books, includingThe Bible Without Secrets, and is an archaeological researcher in Israel.

Our lights had gone out and I was writing at my desk alone by candle light, I was on a hot streak and I wasn't about to let a black out stop me. It was around 9 or 10 p.m. and my husband was out fixing the lights so I had the place to myself; or so I thought. I was in the zone wrapped up in the words flowing from my mind onto the paper and right as the demon creature appeared in the cave alumintated by a sudden clash of lighting and its deafening clap of thunder a sudden thud came from the doorway of the room. I jumped in my seat and looked up into two yellow eyes staring back at me. All I could see was those eyes and still in the mindset of the story it took a moment with my heart racing to realizing I was staring into the eyes of my cat Figaro. He had jumped onto the washing machine in the bathroom across the hall, hence the thud and was staring at me. It didn't help that it was pitch dark everywhere but a couple of feet from the tiny candle on my desk and Figaro was black and fluffy from head to toe.So actually it was my cat that scared me, but I'll never forget that chapter.", "related": ["B0061MWG76"], "rank": 50703, "title": "Costly Obsession: Animalize", "author": "Sasha Pruett", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Breanne has lived through many tragedies, but somehow she has retained the strength to keep fighting. The scenes with the dragons are so descriptive that they come alive for the reader. I enjoyed the comedic relief enacted through the baby dragon Eth. The situations and mischief he always got into was hilarious. Breanne's first reaction when she saw the dragons was fright, but as she got to know them she loved them. Add to this the sorcerer Aldwyn, a most modest and unusual man, and you have a riveting and compelling plot. It is my hope that young people can read this and for a little while live in a world where what seems the impossible is just a moment away.\" - Fallen Angel Reviews\"From childhood, knights and their deeds have fascinated Breanne. After she is orphaned suddenly, she discovers a life that is equally adventurous and brings her into contact with knights, wizards, and dragons. She also learns many things she believed were wrong. But most importantly, she joins her life to that of the rightful heir to the throne, a man in hiding who will need all of the magic Breanne possesses to reclaim his place and restore peace to their land. Considering the man, who Breane loves, is more court jester than king, that could be a challenge for more than obvious reasons. Though greater length would have served this book well by allowing for more world building, the author will easily entertain her target audience in this miniature epic fantasy.\" - Reviewer Amanda Kilgore", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through the use of new data collected explicitly to explore conceptions of justice and applying the latest experimental techniques, the racial differences in attitudes toward crime and justice are deep and seemingly inexorable. Justice in America makes clear the larger consequences and duplicity that come from individuals who are most must vulnerable to crime and who are most dependent on the legal system to also believe system is stacked against them. We are taught that fundamental beliefs about justice and punitive policies are at stack.\"-Darren Davis, University of Notre Dame\"Justice in America is an authoritative account of the racial divide in public opinion about the American criminal justice system. Mark Peffley and Jon Hurwitz trace the divide to differential experiences of discrimination by law enforcement and, as a consequence, divergent views on the fundamental fairness of the police and courts. The insights that emerge from this ambitious study-namely, that it is beliefs about fairness, more so than beliefs about race, that separate blacks and whites in the domain of crime and punishment-demand attention from scholars and policymakers alike.\"-Claudine Gay, Harvard University\"With rigorous and innovative scholarship, Peffley and Hurwitz demonstrate the enormous gulf between whites' and blacks' experiences and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. What is more, they show how these perceptions generate a vast racial divide in understandings of crime and anti-crime policies in the US. An eloquent study that anyone interested how race continues to shape Americans' lives will find indispensable.\"-Martin Gilens, Princeton University\"Justice in America takes on a controversial subject with elegance, creativity, and thoroughness.

A drummer for the 1980's heavy metal band Savage Night, Cal Christopher quits the music scene in 1990, burns down his mansion and fakes his own death, leaving his band-mates mid-tour and facing bankruptcy. Fourteen years later, living as \"Merle\" in New Orleans, he's tracked down by ex-lead singer Todd Delacroix, who tries to blackmail him into a band reunion. When he finds Todd laid out in his hotel room, surrounded by bottles of booze and a suicide note exposing Merle's true identity Merle grabs the note and goes on the run from the cops, the press, the IRS and a couple of mystery men. Faces from the past resurface, including former bandmate Doug, who is dying of AIDS, and his sister Alison, Merle's old flame. It all leads up to a messy surprise ending that defies rational explanation, winding down much too fast much too easily. Nevertheless, it's a fun read about drugs, rock and roll, brawls and banging (drums, groupies and otherwise). A portion of the book's proceeds go to Katrina charities.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is a past board member and committee chairperson of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, DC, and has served in leadership roles for numerous civic, educational and charitable organizations. As a top business executive, Hunter was firmly rooted to the world of logic, but even after reaching numerous pinnacles of success in life, he found himself asking, Is that all there is? A propitious road trip to the American Southwest awakened in him a latent awareness of things unknown or unrecognized, broadening his world perspective and focusing for him what it means to be alive. Through the Curious Journey series of books, he seeks to inform and educate not indoctrinate others on ideas, insights and discoveries associated with the world around us. While Hunter has adopted many New Age perspectives, he s the first to say that some concepts may be way out there and beyond his grasp or acceptance, but still well worth consideration for even the most skeptical. Embarking on your own Curious Journey can be a freeing exercise in learning to accept another s point of view without compromising your principles.

However, something was missing and so began his venture into writing. The stories that grow within the confines of his mind longed to be put down into words (which also helps solve the problem of accent misunderstandings which cause the “deer caught in headlights” syndrome).  His current venture is a volume of books called “Magic, Fairy Tales, and Inter Dimensional Poking Devices”.  Volume one takes the reader on a magical and wacky story taking place in an alternate dimension where fairy tales just happen to be the main industry.  Plenty of silliness abounds as the fairy tale economy faces collapse giving rise to the lollygaggers’ movement.  A wish is cast upon the wishing star for fate to be kind.  Humor and mayhem ensue leading to a wide range of consequences that will unfold the sad story behind why the universe is how it is today.   Volume two picks up where Volume one leaves off.

A farmer beeped. / One turkey flew away.” The remaining turkeys continue the feats, from stilt walking to trapeze flying, but alas for the farmer stuck in his vehicle, his turkey-scattering attempts (flashing lights, banging tools) result in only one turkey departure each time. Finally, one turkey remains but sneakily commandeers the truck, and turkeys pile aboard, stranding the farmer. Thankfully, a carload of pigs offers a lift, leading to the farmer finding his truck (now an artful circus prop), popcorn treats, and maybe even a tiny smile for the festivities. Colorful cartoonlike acrylic illustrations—contrasting happy-faced, googly-eyed turkeys with the increasingly exasperated farmer—capture the chaos with liveliness and humor. Kids will enjoy counting turkeys and finding corresponding numerals incorporated within the pictures. Not just for Thanksgiving.

The appointment of Randolph Gunderson as U.S. attorney general adds to rumors about his financial association with city mobsters, suspected of torching Gunderson's unprofitable buildings. Although Cassella is frankly amoral, he is outraged by the alleged crimes of the new presidential cabinet member and goes looking for facts to back the rumors. The investigation takes the detective to the nation's capitol, to Florida and even to France, and into colorful company that includes amorous women, a shady U.S. senator, an unfrocked priest, profit-hungry media evangelists and Cassella's gangster kin. Trusting in ends that justify means, the detective plunges into the most foolhardy betrayal of his dicey life. The resolution is virtually guaranteed to confirm Beinhart's standing as an extraordinarily gifted author, no more afraid to take daring chances than his tarnished hero. This is a remarkable achievement, with nonstop frights contrasted by uproariously funny incidents and the 20/20 dialogue that personalizes the widely different characters. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild and Mystery Book club alternates.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007UPRPWY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

J.L. declined, being more comfortable with fiction, but the encouragement sent her on her way to writing her first novel. This she threw away immediately after finishing it, and started work on Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. She has never looked back. J.L. lives in Hawaii where she now writes full-time, with help from her husband, the writer and editor John Q. Murray, and two sons.

It is a deep and sad story ... made so poignant because it all takes place on the last morning, leading up to Eleven Eleven The Independent This action-packed thriller combines historical detail with three very personal stories of courage, strength and tragedy, to produce a gripping and thought-provoking account of the final hours of a brutal conflict. This powerful page-turner is ideal for use in history teaching, as well as making compelling reading in its own right The Book Trust The excitement in Paul Dowswell's new book is of the terrifying kind... With every turn of the page mature readers will hold their breath, expecting the worst and hoping for the best. Paul Dowswell deals with war head on, leaving his readers in no doubt of its complexities and horrors The Scotsman The main thrust of this thrilling novel - the futility of war - is vividly portrayed through the actions and interaction of three sometimes puzzled and overwhelmed young men The Irish Examiner Auslander is a superlative, at times almost agonisingly compelling, piece of historical fiction ... The climactic escape to freedom is pure muck-sweat tension Financial Times Doswell is one of the best new writers of historical fiction for children ... [Auslander] steps outside the victim culture of novels such as those by Morris Gleitzman and comes close to classics such as The Silver Sword.

You can read it here at Amazon\n[and I think he posted it around the web, too]; he says my book has \"All\n fluff and no stuff.\" - I knew it was him because of his initials on the\n ID of the review!)This book is written in guy language,\nguy stories, and raw guy stuff. But, in truth, it has the most profound\neffect on women. I see it everyday as a spiritual therapist -- women's\nlives are powerfully changed by this sh*t.I know it seems insane to read a book by a guy who cheated with over 25 women.But\n what if in cheating with so many women he learned something that no one\n else knew? What if in being exposed so much to that never-before-seen\nside of women he saw things that most people don't want to look at, and\nheard things most people don't want to talk about? What if there's\nsomething powerfully there?Well, I'm telling you there is! This book will change your life. Period!You\n can hate me all you want. I'm arrogant. I'm an A-hole. I suck at most\nthings guys are good at -- money, stereos, music, cars, business,\ncareers, economics, politics, sports (well, I'm alright at sports), and\non and on. I truly BLOW at soooo many things in life. And I can be a\ntotal dickhead (just read how arrogant I am in the Preface/Introduction\nof the book). I'm also a total failure at many things, including sex,\ngenerally. Believe it or not, I reveal in this book how often I couldn't\n get it up with these women, failed them sexually, and also what was\ngoing on inside my head that I was actually doing this morally bankrupt\nstuff of cheating with other men's (and women's) wives. I'm no saint and\n I'm definitely no Don Juan.I deliberately write this book raw and honest, so that you won't like me.Why? Becausethat way you're forced to really look at the truths and concepts without any bias toward the author(whereas, most authors try to make the reader like them, too).What\n I am is a guy who learned stuff -- deep stuff -- from all of this. I\nlearned sh*t that no one wants to talk about. I'm represented by the top\n literary agency in the country and the book has already been picked up\nby a major publisher for when it goes to hardcopy......and WHY? Because\nthis sh*t that I learned and saw is quickly becoming the very\ncutting-edge of relationship/marriage discourse! This is the real deal.I\n get plenty of people doggin' me online and questioning the book. And I\ncouldn't care less what people think of me. But anyone doggin' the book\nhasn't read it yet; classic examples of \"judging the book by its cover.\"This book is the one true book that couples can finally read TOGETHER.\n Most publishers say it can't be done, say that men and women won't read\n the same book. But I disagree, if the book is written in language women\n AND MEN can resonate with. And, the reason the book works for women and\n men is because it doesn't put down men or treat 'em like their f--king\nidiots, and it shows the real sh*t going on inside of women. It doesn't\nsay men are innocent, but it also does just automatically crucify them\neither. AND, it doesn't put down women, it just exposes the truths,\nsecrets...and FEARS! Plus, the book has funny and salty-as-hell stories\nthat guys and chicks will love.I'm tellin' ya, flat out, this\n book will change your life and forever change your relationships...and\nhow you view women, especially if you are one!", "related": ["B00A6YP1RC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kousser and Phillips show how bargaining over budgets differs from bargaining over other legislation, the factors that drive whether legislators will hold out or scramble to accept a deal, and when and how a governor's popularity enters the equation. Best of all, the book is about more than American state politics - it delivers a theory of executive power relevant to students of legislative politics anywhere.\" - John Carey, Dartmouth College\"Thad Kousser and Justin Phillips have produced a masterful account of governors' powers in dealing with the fifty state legislatures. They offer a theoretical model of how the dynamics of budget negotiations advantages governors, while bargaining over policy bills advantages legislators.

Thomas Louisville History Book Award\" --\"\"Delivers a rich, fully drawn picture of the brother of John Keats. Until now, no biographer has delved into George Keats's life so completely.\" -- Carol Kyros Walker, author of Walking North with Keats\" --\"\"An interesting account of an Englishman coming to America in the early 19th century and making a life for himself and his family in Kentucky -- his acclimation, acculturation, successes, and failures.\" -- James Holmberg, curator of special collections at The Filson Historical Society\" --\"\"As George Keats completed the arc from being born an Englishman to American citizen, his status upgraded from orphan and working class poor in London, to cultured, leading citizen in Louisville, Kentucky. An investor in properties, board member of fourteen organizations, Keats was respected. Lawrence Crutcher, a descendant of Keats, has written a history so detailed, that investments and debts are described by their significance to the society -- whether English or American.As the reader walks with Keats down Main Street in 1819, a busy, interesting Louisville emerges; by mid-1820's it is a city of culture, the basis of the lively city today.\"- Nana Lampton, Louisville businesswoman, poet, artist\" --\"\"'George Keats deserves better'\" begins this remarkable biography by his great-great-great grandson Lawrence Crutcher. Long treated as just the brother (and a somewhat self-serving one) of the adored poet, George Keats emerges in the pages of George Keats of Kentucky not only with a brisk defense from this descendant, who refutes the received story of financial gullibility and malfeasance, but also as a compelling historical figure in his own right: an illuminating focus for the challenges of establishing a life -- ultimately a prosperous life -- in frontier America. Crutcher writes with engaging clarity, insight, and surefooted reference to an extraordinary archive of information, including materials and striking images published here for the first time. This is exciting, important work, no less than for putting the life of John Keats in a fresh perspective than for making a wonderfully detailed contribution to the field of nineteenth-century American studies -- among the cast of characters Charles Dickens, Abraham Lincoln, James Freeman Clarke, and John James Audubon. The copious illustrations alone are worth the price of admission but those who dive into the text will find themselves swept up by Crutcher's fascinating adventure in historical and biographical narrative.\"--Susan J. Wolfson, Professor of English, Princeton UniversityEditor, John Keats: A Longman Cultural Edition\" --\"Drawing upon fragmentary Keats family correspondence, legal records, personal memoirs and sketches by members of the Keats's English circle, and other archival sources in England, Crutcher untangles the complex Keats family inheritance, explains animosities among generations of the family, illumines the ineptness of those who managed the family estate, and refutes charges by some in the Keats circle that George deliberately cheated John out of his inheritance. In the process, he demonstrates that the brothers maintained a warm relationship until the poet's death, even after George moved to the United States and settled in Louisville.\" -- Carl Kramer, Register of the Kentucky Historical Society\"\"Brilliantly illustrated with more than ninety color photographs, this engaging book reveals how George Keats embraced new business opportunities to become an important member of the developing urban community.\" -- broadwayworld.com\" --\"\"George Keats of Kentucky: A Life, stands as a valuable contribution to history and literaturre alike.\" -- Linda Elisabeth Keattie, Louisville Courier-Journal\" --\"\"Anyone interested in English Romantic literature, antebellum Kentucky or pre-Civil War Louisville will fin dthis book an entertaining and rewarding read.\" -- Robert V. Haynes, professor emeritus, Western Kentucky University, Park City Daily News\" --\"\"The book sets the record straight provifding an in-depth and positive look at brother, husband, entrepreneur and an influential Kentuckian.\" -- Gemma Goodman, H&H; Series\" --\"\"But perhaps the greatest achievement of this biography - and in all probability its mission - is to establish George Keats as a remarkable figure quite apart from his connection to one of ENgland's greatest poets.\" -- Martin Rubin, The Washington Times\" --\"\"Lawrence Crutcher writes this intriguing account of the lesser-known Keats brother, who was an influential figure in his own right.

I am married to Marily Crews-Nelson, and became an instant dad. Years later, we had another daughter. Life is good! I've wanted to be an author since elementary school, in Hastings, Minnesota, where I crafted a small science fiction story, complete with illustrations. It took a long time to achieve my goal. Over the years, I have written reflections and essays on experiences in nature and philosophy, while backpacking or canoeing. My first book was a collaboration of ideas, developed by my long time friend, John Najem, who passed in 2011. This was the propelling force to publish here on Amazon! Since my first quest for publication, I have outlined two more concepts and begun the process of story development, again! I am honored and excited by the concept of delivering more tales for you. I want to retain an original angle to my stories, mixed with a bit or satire. I am happy to call myself an author, at last, and am enriched by the moments of \"word painting\" on my trusty laptop!

After finishing her run as a star in a new TV detective series, Phyllida Moon (last seen in Roundabout) returns to work at the Peter Piper Detective Agency in the little town of Seaminster, England. To investigate possible drug dealing in an amateur acting company, Phyllida transforms herself into a gorgeous, rich American, Sonia Sheridan, and auditions for a play. Transformed again into a mousy spinster, she conducts surveillance on the same group. Even face to face, no one is able to recognize her. In a plea for more credulity from the reader, \"Sonia Sheridan\" is so utterly irresistible that even one of the agency members who knows Phyllida well finds himself falling in love with Sonia. Back to the plot, such as it is: Phyllida discovers that the company's core members share some secret. As she tries to figure this out, she bumps up against another newcomer to the group, a woman with a beautiful voice and a somewhat stiff manner. However, these mysteries are put on the back burner when one of the company members is murdered. When another member attempts to blackmail the murderer, he, naturally, is killed as well. Bland writing and characters, along with a lame trap for the killer at the end, add up to a mystery with little charm and even less suspense.

Her heritage shows from head to toe -- in her tough, work-worn hands, and in the easy, flowing cadence of her mountain voice. Always curious, she wants to know everyone's story and has a knack of getting it -- from the old timers of her childhood to all the other people she has come across since -- from laborers to affluent developers. One cannot encounter Peggy without sharing stories. Many of her stories have roots in her own experiences: Her dad grew beans and raised livestock. Her mother worked at a local factory to supplement the farming income. Relatives, extended family, and church provided a unique atmosphere for living and learning the old mountain traditions. She married at seventeen, finished high school, and started a family. She furthered her education at Appalachian State, but the responsibilities of six children quickly made formal study impossible. She did manage to write a few manuscripts on an old portable typewriter. Her husband teased about her spelling and sentence structure, causing her to become somewhat disillusioned with writing. She turned to crafts to assist in the struggle for survival, marketed her crafts through Blue Ridge Hearthside Crafts Cooperative, and became a board member for the organization. Moving to her own farm, she continued to raise her own food, adding a milk cow and other livestock. Tobacco was the main cash crop. Christmas trees were planted to assist the children through college. Being active in agriculture, Peggy became a board member of Farm Bureau Insurance, the local Christmas Tree Association, NC Agricultural Extension Advisory Council, and NC State University. These positions enabled her to experience some of the life beyond the mountains. For more than thirty years, Peggy assisted her husband -- a land surveyor-- with the field and office work. Through contacts made with a developer client, she started selling her Christmas trees on a lot in Naples, Florida, becoming known there as: The Christmas Tree Lady. The survey business gave Peggy additional insight on the impacts -- good and bad -- to the community as the mountains became a tourist and second home destination. As the children grew up, went to college, married and had families of their own, there became time for writing. Wanting to know if she was good enough to write seriously, she attended many classes and joined a local writers group. During a luncheon, Terry Kay told her: All words are the same. It's how you use them that makes the difference. He also advised her to write something that wasn't personal. Her first (2003) published novel, Heaven-High and Hell-deep, resonates with Peggy's unique strong voice and storytelling ability. Always resourceful, Peggy decided she would not only write books, but she'd make and market them herself. Consequently, every book is uniquely hers: she writes the stories, paints the cover picture, then prints and binds each one at her farm. Whether from her experiences, shared stories, or from the spirits of the past; characters keep evolving in Peggy's imagination. Then they nag her until she relates their story. Often she is working on seven or eight novels simultaneously, completing one for the character that becomes the most persistent. They just have to deal with Peggy casting their stories in her beloved mountains.", "related": ["B00IQ3094A"], "rank": 658921, "title": "Sweet Lendy: An Appalachian Whodunit", "author": "Peggy Poe Stern", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bruised, battered and, on occasion, beaten too, in sales battles galore, he has boot-strapped startups and beefed-up hi-tech companies.A quest for the holy grail of scholastic achievement driven perhaps more by confusion than clarity saw him graduate in industrial engineering; major in R&D; management and energy management at B-school and then earn a master s degree in operations research. Those academic adventures (or, misadventures?) had him careen through the portals of elite institutions of national importance like IIT, Kharagpur and IISc, Bangalore. His random-walk-like pursuits continued into the professional realm at HCL Limited veritably India s Big Blue. Early experiments in executive life had him put his nose to the grindstone in multifarious functions. Eventually, he meandered into a biz-development role with HCL Hewlett-Packard in Mumbai (then Bombay) and metamorphosed from a managerial generalist to a sales specialist. A Utopian quest for executive bliss made him jump jobs and geographies in the mid-90s to head operations in California for Birlasoft Inc., a GE Equity investment company. During his spell with the Birlas (arguably India s Rockefellers), he forged business ties with several blue-chip corporations and helped those bellwethers gain competitive mileage. At the dawn of this millennium, he found his true calling in the wibbly-wobbly world of entrepreneurship. The blind leap of faith gave him a freewheeling, not necessarily free-falling, chance to flirt with a whole range of emergent technology areas such as Knowledge Management, Handheld Computing and RFID. While not quite hitting an El-Dorado-like jackpot, Kiran did make a pretty penny off his first venture, Kenware Inc. And, in the alluring world of startups, once bitten, always spry! To start all over again! Thus he turned sequent entrepreneur a self-description he prefers to serial entrepreneur, a term that does evoke feelings of being in a peccant profession. So he segued smoothly into the Californian Gold Rush of the Internet kind to co-found Cylive Corp., which is a stealth-mode company in the Web 2.0/3.0, Social Media, P2P Commerce and Enterprise 2.0 spaces.Kiran has chalked out agile processes and astute strategies to address challenges of low-entry barriers, globalisation and cutthroat competition in not only enterprise segments, but also consumer markets. The bust-many-a-gut bustle in his gigs has spanned a gamut of activities from outbound and telephone sales to alliance and Internet marketing. He rabidly swears brand- and business-building are about casting intimate ties with and conveying value to clients a surefire recipe for boosting stake-holder wealth. For earning your spurs in sales, he prescribes MOSS - the mantra-of-smart-sweat, which revolves around the philosophy of: The harder and smarter you work, the keener and luckier you get. He s championed high standards of personal integrity and professional ethics in an all-heart credo, which he calls Clean Conscience Selling. A blazed trail of excellence steering enterprises responsibly; contracting profitably; scaling operations predictably and sustainably bears ample testimony to not just salesmanship, but also his leadership traits. An intense and inspirational speaker on sales and marketing, Kiran presents ideas that are insightful; opinions considered. Blending youthful energy with plentiful acumen, he delivers talks that are provocative and entertaining. Footloose and on the move most of his life, Kiran has now set up shop in the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore.", "related": [], "rank": 5073520, "title": "Gita and the Art of Selling", "author": "Kiran Bettadapur", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also produce all my own illustrations (with one or two exceptions) through a technique involving photographing toys as models and matting them against a photograph of a background that I have  taken myself and then converted using special software into the style I  desire.

My short stories are engaging and unique. I have put a lot of myself into my work and invested many hours drafting, re-drafting, proofing, editing  and finally producing each book.

She spent much of her childhood reading novels that would whisk her away on magical adventures.  By high school, her love of reading had sparked an interest in writing.  Her projects evolved from poetry collections to fiction short stories and eventually, to novels.  While earning her Bachelor's degree in Business Management, JoAnna wrote her first full-length novel, Restless Mind  The project became a passion that found her bonding with her laptop for days on end.  She enjoyed the process so much that she wrote another novel, titled The View From the Fishbowl, not long after.  JoAnna is now writing her third book, Under the Maple Tree, which she expects to finish soon.  JoAnna delights in the enjoyment others can derive from her work, and would be happiest writing and sharing her stories with the world.   JoAnna grew up in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  When JoAnna was a child, her family settled in Vancouver, Washington, just north of Portland, Oregon.  JoAnna still lives in the area with her family and her two dogs.  When she's not writing, JoAnna enjoys spending her time with her family, entertaining friends as well as drawing and painting.", "related": [], "rank": 3758723, "title": "Restless Mind", "author": "JoAnna Santanen", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His Kidnapper’s Shoes was published in both paperback and e-book format in 2013, followed by her second novel, entitled Sister, Psychopath. Her third novel, Guilty Innocence, has now been published, and like her first two, features her home city of Bristol. She is currently working on her fourth novel. Before turning her hand to writing, Maggie worked mainly as an accountant, with a short diversion into practising as a nutritional therapist. Diet and health remain high on her list of interests, along with travel. Accountancy does not, but then it never did. The urge to pack a bag and go off travelling is always lurking in the background!

This is as true for firms competing directly with foreign companies as it is for domestic firms whose suppliers, customers, and competitors are increasingly likely to be from foreign countries.TheFifth EditionofMultinational Financepresents a difficult subject in an accessible way. It provides a clear framework for evaluating the many opportunities, costs, and risks of multinational operations in a manner that allows readers to see beyond the algebra and terminology to the general principles of multinational financial management. And while this book assumes the viewpoint of the financial manager of a large multinational enterprise—with investment or financial operations in more than one country—the insights outlined here can work just as well for government entities, small businesses, and even individuals that operate in the global marketplace.Divided into five comprehensive parts, this new edition ofMultinational Financeretains the classic features that have made previous editions so popular, as well as a wealth of new material on current topics of interest to practitioners and students of multinational finance.Part Ipresents an in-depth treatment of the international financial environment, including international trade and the balance of payments, currency and Eurocurrency markets, and international parity conditionsPart IIcontains detailed discussions of currency futures, options, and swaps, and examines the importance of these derivative instruments in financial risk managementPart IIIexplores the operation of the multinational treasury, the rationale for hedging currency risks, and the multinational corporation's management of transaction, operating, and translation exposures to currency riskPart IVdevelops the intricacies of valuing and structuring the corporation's international assets and liabilitiesPart Vtakes a market-oriented view of the multinational corporation, with separate chapters on international capital markets, portfolio diversification, and asset pricingDesigned to aid in the learning process, this reliable resource includes highlighted callouts of key terms and concepts, conceptual questions and numerical problems, suggested readings, and website recommendations that link chapter topics to the real world. And for instructors thinking about adopting the text for classroom use, it includes more than 600 PowerPoint slides that review the key elements of each chapter, a Solutions Manual with answers to the end-of-chapter questions and problems, and a comprehensive Test Bank with more than 1,000 test questions and solutions.Dealing with financial operations or investments in more than one country can be difficult. To excel at this endeavor, it's essential to follow a simple and intuitive approach. TheFifth EditionofMultinational Financewill help you achieve this elusive goal and show you how to make the most of the opportunities available in today's international market.", "related": [], "rank": 1625117, "title": "Multinational Finance", "author": "Kirt C.

Tanya Stowe and Delia Latham create interesting characters who are well developed and a plot that doesn't feel rushed; instead I felt like I had actually read a full-length story. Chloe was such a delightful, yet realistic child. Instead of being perfectly cute, we see her emotional ups and downs which made her much more endearing. Instead of focusing on the fact that Chloe was a special needs child, the authors created a normal child that just happened to have Down's Syndrome. The imaginary friend added another layer to the story. The romance that developed between the main characters was sweet and will leave readers longing for a Dex of their own! While there is a Christmas feel to the story, I honestly wouldn't hesitate to read this one any time of the year. Perfect for a quick afternoon read. Fans of good clean reads will certainly enjoy this book, a feel-good story that left me wanting to read more from these authors!  Reviewed by Brenda Casto for Readers' Favorite.", "related": [], "rank": 1138008, "title": "A Cowboy Christmas (Hearts Haven)", "author": "Delia Latham", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For now, Bernardo hopes that young readers enjoy his first adventure story aboutGo Girl and Little Guy.Bernardo's first book is based on stories he concocted for the amusement of his children, who like him love superheroes.

Little Guy sees the world as \"One Big Adventure\", and his big beloved sister as superhero, just like he perceives himself. Thus, even ordinary outings to the playground with Mom and the rest of the family become exciting adventures during which Little Guy and the troops (AKA his siblings) train for missions yet unknown.This fun book is the first in a series ofLittle Guy and Go Girladventures by author Bernardo Juroviesky. Bernardo recommends to all boys and girls to create their own adventures.

These are notoriously difficult questions: How did the capacity for language evolve in the deep history of our species? How do different languages evolve in the more recent histories of our societies? Hurford is one of the few scholars with the authority and interdisciplinary reach to give us compelling and plausible answers. The Origins of Language is a rare achievement, and highly recommended. N. J. Enfield, Max Planck Institute, Nijmegen, and University of Sydney Hurford has written a delightful little book, an ideal point of entry into the range of complex issues facing anyone that wants to understand how human language evolved. Darwin himself would have cherished this guide. Cedric Boeckx, ICREA/Universitat de Barcelona No one has thought more deeply about the evolution of the human language faculty than James Hurford, and no one writes about the topic more engagingly. In this book he explains and synthesizes the most important findings concerning language evolution from across a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including linguistics, biology, ethology, psychology, and cognitive science. His writing is always grounded in evidence-based argumentation, yet is informative and clear for the non-specialist reader. To introduce in such a short work all the major aspects of the evolution of language from the beginnings of a special human type of communication to the emergence of sound systems, through meaning to symbolic words to sentence structure is an impressive feat. To make it not only thorough but thoroughly readable is a real achievement. A lovely little book: great fun, cogent, and scientifically solid.

Like the three previous books,Three-Waysis narrated by Detective Karen Seagate. She is 42, a recovering\nalcoholic who is trying to figure out how to deal with her disease, a\nby-the-books chief, a new boyfriend with his own attic full of emotional\n baggage, and a world that, in general, makes little sense. She wants to\n dislike her young partner, Ryan Miner, a cheerful Mormon with a wife\nand 2.5 kids, but with this, as with most of her goals, she fails.Three-Waysis about the murder of Austin Sulenka, a graduate student who is a sex\naddict. Seagate and Miner start with the three women he had sex with on\nhis last night on earth: his girlfriend, who charms every man with her\nstriking beauty; a former student in his writing course who is still\nbitter because he reneged on the promise to give her a B if she slept\nwith him; and his thesis adviser, who might have revealed to him a\nsecret in her past that could destroy her career.Investigating\nthe various love and sex triangles that complicated the victim's short\nlife, Karen Seagate finds herself in a three-way relationship that\npromises to jeopardize her own fragile sobriety.Detective Karen\nSeagate is foul-mouthed, cynical, rude, depressed, and insubordinate.\nShe lies constantly and assumes that most of what people say is untrue.\nShe expects nothing good to happen to her and is rarely surprised. She's\n too high-maintenance for most men and for all bosses. Really, there\nwould be no good reason for anyone to want to have anything to do with\nher--that is, if she were not extremely good at figuring out which liar\nis also a killer.Average review on Amazon: 4.6\"The\ncharacters are captivating, some tugged at my heartstrings and others\ngot under my skin. It's fast paced and kept me guessing until the end.\nIf you're a mystery fan then you'll love this book and if you're not a\nfan of this genre this could be the book that converts you.\" -Amazon\nreviewer\"You will have a hard time finding a better way to\nentertain yourself with a book; this is fine summer reading.\" -Amazon\nreviewer", "related": [], "rank": 677802, "title": "Three-Ways: A Detectives Seagate and Miner Mystery", "author": "Mike Markel", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though the focus was mainly on pieces for the stage, Elias never felt that he should focus solely on writing stories for the stage, the big or small screen or the written word. Living in Belgium with his beautiful, creative wife, Elias enjoys the simple things. Going out for a walk with Mrs., sipping on lukewarm tea and foamy cappuccino's and never taking anything for granted.  In 2014, he started the Belgian-based writer's collective 'Sireen Collective'. With its sole interest being that of telling a good story, this collective provides stories tailor-made, releases stories by itself and offers a helping hand when in need of aid on your own projects.
