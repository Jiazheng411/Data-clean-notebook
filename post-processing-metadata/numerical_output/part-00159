His appearance has eased his flight from an abusive mother in New York City and made it possible for him to find minimum-wage jobs. He hopes for something better and more interesting when he hires on at the Sam Houston Tiger Ranch in central Texas. Dealing closely with the daily needs of big cats, he finds that his boss and coworkers are a colorful bunch, including ranch co-owner Sunny. Her brother and partner, Wayland, has recently disappeared and is presumed dead. The heart of the story is Cody's learning the ropes and beginning to feel a sense of home. A touching subplot involves an eight-year-old neighbor with a bad stutter whom Cody draws out of his shyness, and the violence of a summer tornado is a tense counterpoint to Cody's well-earned happiness. The other subplots, concerning Wayland and the accusation that Sunny murdered him, as well as Cody's worries that his mother, a noted television child psychologist, might find him, add unnecessary and not terribly convincing clutter to the story.

But when her mother falls ill, she's pulled east, pregnant at age 39 by an ex-boyfriend. Soon, her mother dies, and Jules stays at home, speaking to the high school drama class and trying to figure out what kind of mother she might make. But then Vick, a troubled teenage boy, accuses her of molesting him, and Jules's meditative seclusion becomes a quest to clear her name. As Jules faces the charges against her and tries to unravel Vick's troubled past, she finds her own path to motherhood more tangled than ever. Though the plot has a few unlikely turns, Page's knack for characterization brings it back down to earth and helps nudge things toward an appropriately affirmative ending.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A dirigible launched a transoceanic attempt from Atlantic City. Balloonists ascended from St. Louis in a contest for longest-flight bragging rights. Heavier-than-air-machines revved up at New York’s Belmont horse track to compete for superlatives in height, speed, and racing. The front-page celebrities of the moment, these aeronauts excited popular interest that Mortimer, capitalizing on archives and contemporary gazettes, restores excellently. No detail, from flying togs to picnic hampers to society gossip, was too tangential for reporters to note. Such period detail embroiders Mortimer’s narrative arcs, of which the first two are straightforward: that dirigible’s crew was rescued at sea, and the balloonists came down in Canadian wilds and elsewhere to wend their ways back to civilization. In contrast, the airplane meet was a harum-scarum drama with wealthy sportsmen—which most entrants besides businessmen Orville and Wilbur Wright were—wrecking their machines and retreating to hotels or hospitals as necessary. For fans of death-defying early aviation, Mortimer’s history is great fun. --Gilbert Taylor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Elizabeth Silance Ballard consistently displays just the right touch of empathy whether she writes a warm and fuzzy story or one that deals with deepest despair. This collection can be read solely as entertainment, but it is worthy of so much more.  This book could easily be classified as an excellent teaching aid.  Each account has strong moral principles and reminders that one never knows for sure just who your words and actions are going to affect.  Ballard has not been afraid to tackle such tough issues as child beating, incest, and suicide.  She points out that people who do not fit in may not be socially challenged; they just might be struggling with problems too big for them to handle.  The author handles all of this with straight-forwardness, compassion and without sermonizing. Three Letters From Teddy is an excellent example of how the human spirit triumphs over obstacles, and how one caring person can make the difference between success and failure. --Judy Jacobs, Editor and Critic, St. Joseph, MO", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Lewises acknowledge there are no simple formulas or simple answers. But the biblical insight, emotional understanding, and practical encouragement they offer will be life changing.  Written by a hurting parent for other hurting parents, this book, by ministering to hundreds of thousands of families over the past thirty years, has earned a prominent spot not only on the personal bookshelves of countless parents and their family and friends, but also on the professional shelves of pastors, youth ministers, and Christian counselors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He published the children’s picture book “Ole And Zac And The Port Of Tumbattle” (FASTPRINT PUBLISHING, 2010), and he has had several articles published in newspapers and magazines. His subject matter is varied, ranging from the growth in Print On Demand publishing, to articles on Olympic hopefuls, and even a preview and review of a performance by rockabilly legend Sleepy Labeef, that included an interview with the singer himself. This is his first venture into adult humorous fiction, and he is determined to make a success of it, despite being told by a number of literary agents and publishers that the market for this genre does not really exist. He has also performed as an after dinner speaker on a number of occasions, as a result of another of his passions, playing amateur cricket. Originally from Sale in Cheshire, Michael now lives with his wife Sally in the more peaceful surroundings of Whaley Bridge, in the Peak District.

She decided that there were sufficient grounds of doubt, so she called off the marriage.However, she had reckoned without the formidable Overmeer family, whose desperate financial straits compelled them to take steps to protect their interests.

As both\na reader and a writer, one aspect of story development I use to gauge the\neffectiveness of a story is plausibility. Plot twists are an interesting way to\nkeep readers fully engaged, but an implausible plot twist can make a story seem\ncontrived and forced. WhileThe\nConvergingwas a fairly straightforward horror tale, this second novel was\na more nuanced story. The central theme through all three novels revolves\naround disparate forces, each with their own distinct agendas, being brought\ntogether at one critical juncture with explosive and deadly consequences. While\nthis theme is certainly front and center in this sequel, I also wanted to\nintroduce a psychological aspect to the story...a study of how a creature of pure\nevil would be attenuated and undermined by emotions such as love and\nself-sacrifice. Cynara begins the novel as a creature of pure malevolence but\nis gradually transmogrified by her unexpected affection for the entity she\ncreated at the conclusion of the first novel.The success or\nfailure of this novel is predicated on my ability to sell the ending of this\nnovel as a plausible plot twist. I think the key to achieving this comes in\nlaying the foundations for major changes...either in story direction or character\nbehaviour...throughout the story. The foreshadowing can be subtle, but the reader\nshould be able to reflect back on the story and see where the seeds of these\ntwists were sewn during the course of the novel.I've always been\nintrigued by the moral grey areas that define characters rather than extreme\nand obvious distinctions between black and white...good and evil. At several key\npoints in the story, I constructed moral pitfalls for Nathaniel Simpson (the\nnovel's key protagonist) that left him questioning his own motivations and\ncharacter. I find these grey areas are interesting points of exploration in the\ncreative fiction landscape and lend themselves well to the horror genre in\nparticular.As was the\ncase withThe Converging, Mark of the\nDemonis a novel with a distinct ending that affords the reader the option\nof moving on to the concluding volume or being satisfied with the ending and\nputting the story to rest. I can say, with a reasonable degree of confidence,\nthat those who become engrossed with Cynara and Elizabeth's\ndark and tragic tale will want to discover just how their story is resolved inClosures in Blood.", "related": ["B00AU5A88O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wants Austin to come with her, but he--though prosperous and Harvard-educated--is inextricably bound to the fertile Maine soil. Fay wanders from Mexico to Florida and finally settles in Arizona. Both she and her husband form temporary liaisons with others , but their strong attachment eventually brings them back together again. In the end Austin, rather predictably, elects to give up the potato farm for life with Fay in Tucson. Convincing, well-drawn characters and an earthy prose style lift this novel to just above average fare.

Nothing much while\nyou're experiencing it. However, when seen from the outside by a\nnon-participant, it can sometimes seem hilarious. As we look back over\nthe sexual encounters of our youth, we might find many incidents to\nlaugh about, but we are also liable to find some things that sadden or\nperplex us. Pre-adolescent sexual abuse, as we are now learning, is and\nhas been far more prevalent than we once believed, and it can often be\ndevastating to those who experience it, sometimes setting the stage for a\n life of promiscuity. This is especially true for children who are\nparticularly cute, an attribute that can be both advantageous and\ndetrimental when it comes to maturing into a sexually well adjusted\nadult.It is this sticky subject that I attempt to explore here\nin a lighthearted manner, though I want to caution readers never to take\n the subject itself lightly. Those with a heightened sensitivity to such\n things should be forewarned that some of what they are about to read\nwill be disturbing, since the story deals with hard subjects like\nfamilial sexual abuse, homosexuality and pedophilia, all of which are\ndescribed in fairly graphic detail.Finally, I want to reiterate\nthat this is a work of fiction and that none of the characters are real.\n If you recognize yourself or someone you know, it is only because\ncertain experiences may be fairly common and you or your acquaintance\nmay have experienced similar things.", "related": ["B00EENE9G0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of.My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction.\n Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two forensic wildlife pathologists—Isabel Spinner (a restless, dedicated animal lover and second-generation Scot) and Marian Windhorse Gray (a beautiful, flirty Oskeena Native American)—join Isabel's underwater photographer brother, Andrew, and his associate, obsidian-eyed Marshall McGreggor, for a dive to photograph an undersea volcano off the Oregon coast, when Marshall suffers a massive coronary. Lacking a healthy human heart, doctors implant the heart of a baboon, forcing Marshall to come to terms with his status as xenotransplantation guinea pig as well as his sudden and disturbing dreams of being a baboon on a savanna. He makes a miraculous recovery and becomes friends with spunky Irene Feinstein, a young woman with a pig valve in her heart, but is increasingly troubled by dreams of Hara, a female baboon in distress. Meanwhile, a disastrous beaching of whales and dolphins on the Oregon coast leads to the discovery that underwater U.S. military experiments with mid-to-low-frequency active sonar may be destroying the inner ears of the sea mammals. Is this just sonar—or the prototype for some new and terrible weapon? When Irene tells Marshall that Hara is being held in a Portland animal testing lab, they, aided by Andrew and a bunch of activists, orchestrate a daring rescue before they head back to the coast to try to stop the sonar experiments. Clunky exposition and credibility-straining twists mar the book, but Peterson's passion shines through.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chester (North Park Theological Seminary) writes “The Retrospective View of Romans 7: Paul’s Past in Present Perspective,” suggesting the apostle’s description of his struggle speaks more to his pre-Christian self.Grant R. Osborne (Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) offers “The Flesh Without the Spirit: Romans 7 and Christian Experience,” perceiving Romans 7 as an accurate representation of what believers go through even after their conversion.Mark A. Seifrid (The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary), in “The Voice of the Law, the Cry of Lament, and the Shout of Thanksgiving,” asserts that Paul is not speaking of his past or his present Christian experience in Romans 7, but more fundamentally and simply about “the human being confronted with the Law.”Chad O. Brand (The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) writes a conclusion on the theological and pastoral implications of Romans 7.“One difficult and disputed text, three fine scholars, and three views of the passage. How is one to read Romans 7? This book takes you through all the options and rationale with detail, charity, and clarity. This is how to have a discussion over a disputed text. Read and learn about Romans 7. Decide who is right and why. And, above all, learn about how to discuss a difficult text.”—Darrell L. Bock, research professor of New Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary“The meaning of Romans 7 continues to bedevil and puzzle readers. This volume does not simply rehearse arguments and positions from the past. The authors approach the text from fresh and illuminating perspectives, and hence this work represents a significant contribution to scholarship.”—Thomas R. Schreiner, James Buchanan Harrison professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary“Christians have long debated how Paul’s moving depiction of a struggle with sin in Romans 7 should influence our theology and practice of the Christian life. Now, in one book, Christians are given a wonderful opportunity to engage the different views, see how they differ, and come to their own conclusions. Chester, Osborne, and Seifrid clearly and capably defend their positions; and they do so with enough of a difference in method that the reader is given a good sense of the scope of the issues and their significance.”—Douglas J.

He never planned on falling in love with Cadence Greer. She takes the job, right along with his heart.The Cowboy's Spring Romance- Trent Thompson is confident, laid-back, and easy going except when he's around Lindsay Pierce. He's definitely met his match in the lovely school teacher.The Cowboy's Summer Love- Travis Thompson has loved Tess Morgan as long as he can remember. When they both return home to Grass Valley, the pull of attraction to one another is so strong it's about to throw them off kilter.The Cowboy's Autumn Fall- Brice Morgan thinks love at first sight is for idiots, at least until he meets Bailey Bishop and falls head over heels for the serious, career-minded girl.The Cowboy's New Heart- Denni Thompson emphatically declares herself too old to love again.

In fact, every time Hari takes her for a walk and they run into anything alive - cat, dog, squirrel, grownup, kid - she snarls. Hari was freaked out by this at first, and thought Coquette would bite him, but now he barely notices it, except that whenever he and Coquette walk past someone, the person jumps a little and then steps off the sidewalk into the street.     She also snorts and rasps a lot. Especially when she's asleep, which is a lot of the time. She likes to lie down in the middle of the floor of any room where people are, so that the people have to step over her, and if a person even touches her slightly with one toe, she wakes right up, snarls, and sometimes snaps at the person.", "related": ["B00EA0O60Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After failing to make the grade as a professional football player, he spent much of his early years traveling, hitch-hiking around Europe and North Africa and then heading to Asia. His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months. He is a bestseller in Europe and his work has sold into translation in 23 countries: Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year. ISABELLA is due to be published in 2013.", "related": ["B00E9POJ40"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You’re going to want to read this.”—Terry Fallis, author of Canada Reads winnerThe Best Laid PlansandUp and Down “Sharp and funny. . . . An insider’s book with great gossip and surprising plot twists, it will keep Ottawa talking for months.”—Stevie Cameron, author ofOn the FarmandOn the Take “In our timesSussex Driveseems far from Camelot and so near to the Sunday service in Red Deer.

In this edgy and terrific satire we see Linda Svendsen’s eye for revealing detail, ability to create real characters, and crisp prose—everything that made those who readMarine Lifewant more. She targets politics in a way recognizable even to people who live not in Ottawa but Washington, D.C. Blending the political and personal,Sussex Driveshows us the brutality of political life and the essential humanity of those in it. Trollope might have written a book like this—if he’d collaborated with Jane Austen.”—Robert A. Lehrman, novelist and former chief speechwriter to U.S. Vice President Al Gore “Can Ottawa possibly be this out of control? It can be if it’s dominated by two fabulous women who happen to be the wife of the PM, and the Governor General herself.Sussex Drive, funny, chilling and addictive, gets my vote.”—Judith Timson, author and journalist“A witty, funny, sexy romp that flirts with international intrigue, love, lust and duty in an alternate Ottawa that seems eerily real.

In it, he takes on mental illness, friendship, lost souls, love, the power of words and redemption, while kicking along at a highly readable pace. Unlike most first novels that race from one \"big issue\" to another, however,The Greatest Unit of Valueholds on to its hat while racing down the road.The story finds Granger Callahan, a veteran of ongoing mental problems, taking life cues from the discarded journal of a young, severely frustrated filmmaker named Zachary Klein. Granger takes off across the country and meets Natalie Chambers, an experienced grifter and drug-hound. Sadoff places the plot within the maelstrom of Granger's troubled, seeking mind, veering from one direction to another to another, sometimes all at once. Sadoff's gift for lively description not only colors the story, it actually serves here as a touchstone for readers who may be occasionally puzzled and unsure of what's happening. It's OK -- that's how Granger sees it, too.Sadoff says he grew up in a house full of shrinks (\"both professional and amateur\"), so the fact that his first novel is about a brilliant but out-there-crazy protagonist is no surprise. It doesn't, however, explain Sadoff's growth as a writer since years ago, when he placed second in a Creative Loafing fiction contest. Whatever the explanation, the guy's got real depth, a knack for the telling description and powerhouse levels of imagination and heart. Pick this one up and fasten your seat belts. - John Grooms,Creative Loafing", "related": [], "rank": 3481875, "title": "The Greatest Unit of Value", "author": "Michael Sadoff", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Upon graduating from high school I attended Loyola University of the South on a basketball scholarship. In 1960 I  was picked for Who's Who Among Students ...., graduated cum laude and married Mary Ann Reising.  After four years at Louisiana State University, and after having obtained an M.A. in January, 1962, and having finished course work for the doctorate in history, I entered the United States Army in April 1964 as a 2nd Lieutenant.  I took my doctorate at a January 1966 commencement.  I was released from active duty with the rank of captain in May 1966. My first professional appointment came at Seattle University in September 1966.  I taught at Seattle for three years.  In September 1969 I accepted a visiting position as associate professor at Indiana University in Bloomington.  My first book (see list of publications below) had placed highly in the Turner award competition of the Organization of American Historians. In 1971 I accepted an appointment as an associate professor at the University of Miami.  Although my work met the satisfaction of my peers I found the university and city difficult stations.  The absence of a doctoral program in history limited my opportunities to direct research.  When Texas Tech University offered me a position in September 1973, we moved to Lubbock.  Texas Tech consistently supported my work with research money and several faculty development leaves.  Most of my published work appeared after arriving here.  I also became director of the graduate program for two years before taking a leave.  In 1979 the local chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, a history honorary, awarded me the annual Outstanding Teacher Award.  In the 1980s I began studying how to use quantitative history techniques and the computer in my work.  In 1985 the College of Arts and Sciences picked me as the outstanding research professor of the year.

Therefore, I endorse wholeheartedly The Bible Can Be Proven and I wish that all would take an opportunity to read it. I pray the Holy Spirit will work through this book to inspire as many as possible. I wish Vince great success in this endeavor.\"-- Pastor John J. Puthuparampil, Elder of the United Methodist Upper NY Conference and former pastor of Onondaga Hill United Methodist Church\"The culture is filled with Bible-talk, much miss-understood, taken out of context and post-modern perspective. The Bible Can Be Proven gives rare insight into Bible truth and will be a useful resource to those seeking real truth. As an educator, I wholeheartedly endorse this manuscript as a key tool to equip the Body of Christ for ministry.\"-- Ossie Mills, Vice President of Advancement Oral Roberts University and Winner of 3 Emmys, 10 Telly Awards, and multiple Communicator Awards\"So many Christians are hesitant to get into any meaningful discussion about the authority and divine inspiration of the Bible. It's not because they don't believe it... they just don't feel armed with enough data to support what they believe. The Bible Can Be Proven is a marvelous tool that any Christ-follower can use to not only be encouraged and built up in their faith, but be emboldened to share that faith with others.\"-- David Welday, President, Next Generation Institute\"When I first met Vince Latorre, I was immediately impressed by his humble, thoughtful presentation. As I thumbed through his manuscript, I was wowed by his brilliance. In fact, I used this book as a resource in my homeschool classroom with my two teenagers this year. I hope this book gets into the hands of other young adults, especially those who struggle to believe and stare at the ceiling at night and ask, 'Is the Bible really true?'\"-- C. Hope Flinchbaugh, Editor, journalist, and award winning author\"How can I describe this book? It's absolutely amazing. I found it impacting, informative, enlightening, and refreshingly different from any apologetic book I've read. My recommendation is that you get out your marker and go to work.

He tells about street people who make book on the NYSE cotton market, about a Hindy in love with an Arab, about a man who never works but always watches. The stories spread from Dhondy's childhood to early manhood, from about 1950 to 1962, and while a strong setting never emerges, strong emotions do. Andrea G.

With more than a quarter of a century experience in the book industry, she hopes this one will propel her into the bestseller category. Time will tell.

Aus eigenem Erleben kennt er die Tricks der Waffenhändler, der Treuhänder in Zürich und die der Banken. Die Methoden der Schlapphüte des KGB und der westlichen Gegenspieler hat er schmerzhaft am eigenen Leib erlebt. Er sagt - ich schreibe aus meinem Kopf ab. Und wenn das nicht reicht, nehme ich die Köpfe meiner Freunde hinzu. Geboren 1942 in Landsberg/Warthe, aufgewachsen in Güstrow, Krefeld und auf vielen Stationen dazwischen. Ausbildung - etwas liederlich, größtenteils auf Reisen, weniger auf Schulen. Reisen nehmen einen großen Teil seines Lebens ein, besonders die Jahre bei der Handelsmarine. Diese Phase beeinflusst ganz wesentlich sein Schreiben. Detlev Crusius hat gelebt und gearbeitet in Krefeld, Köln, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Rom, London, Moskau, Riad, Jeddah, Tripolis, Damaskus und Zürich. Zu seiner Biografie gehören auch vier Jahre Gefängnis, wegen Verstoß gegen das Außenwirtschaftsgesetz und das UN-Embargo gegen Libyen.

Prunella is also going\nthrough strange times in her own life, and of course Tobias is facing\nmore struggles and turmoil than any child his age should have to face.\nWhat these three all have in common, however, is definitely\ngoing to keep you guessing for some time. As their tales become more and\n more convoluted it will seem as though there is no way to make sense of\n it all, until everything slowly comes to light in Jane Lowy's wonderful\n story of family, love, and friendship.This book was definitely one of the best I've read so far. I felt like I\n was really a part of the story and I couldn't help relating to Prunella\n and Wobbly. I felt so sorry for Tobias and then happy when things\nstarted to look better for him. This book definitely kept me intrigued\nand interested so much that I simply couldn't put it down. I'm very\nhappy that I chose to read this book and only regret that the tale had to end so soon. I would recommend this book\nto anyone as I really do think it's an intriguing and captivating tale.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From the author: At the age of 24 I got married, overnight becoming a father of two step-sons. My first daughter was born soon after, with two more newborns arriving in the span of three years. These experiences as a husband and father of five lead me to unusual insight and perspective. I, like many of us, wrestle with the tension between my dreams and my daily requirements. My writing attempts to blend the ideal and the practical.  As an author I have been called unconventional and overly conversational.  As a father I have been called all sorts of names. (I'm sure you understand me on that one) But above all else, I try to write as a person who knows the things in life that matter, and believes they are worth talking about.

His 26 years as a financial advisor and investment firm CEO had taught Bowen that many advisors lacked the high-quality empirical data and pragmatic business experience necessary to build hugely successful businesses. Bowen founded CEG Worldwide to fill that void, with the belief that providing advisors and institutions with research about the best practices of top elite advisors—and the coaching to use these practices effectively—would help them achieve new levels of success. CEG Worldwide represents the culmination of Bowen’s unique financial services industry experience. That experience encompasses a career as a financial advisor, including eight years as CEO of Reinhardt Werba Bowen Advisory Services, where he helped manage more than $1.6 billion in assets. Bowen sold that company and subsequently became CEO of Assante Capital Management, where he served as a member of the senior team as the firm more than tripled assets under management to more than $25 billion. Through these experiences, Bowen learned firsthand the best practices for substantial success. He also learned that the vast majority of advisors and institutions lacked a road map to build a simple and elegant practice—so he founded CEG Worldwide to provide other advisors and institutions the lessons his experience had taught him. Bowen is widely recognized as a leader in the financial services industry. He writes a highly acclaimed monthly column for the leading U.S. financial services trade journal, Financial Planning. He is the author or co-author of several books, including Breaking Through: Building a World-Class Wealth Management Business, The Prudent Investor’s Guide to Beating Wall Street at Its Own Game and Creating Equity: How to Build a Hugely Successful Asset Management Business. Bowen received his BS degree in economics from the State University of New York Fredonia, an MBA in taxation from Golden Gate University and a master’s degree in financial services from The American College.", "related": [], "rank": 3243798, "title": "The Client-Centric Shift eBook", "author": "John Bowen", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald's writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be 'the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller'. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rick ministered widely throughout the United States for many years before answering God's call in 1991 to move his family to the former Soviet Union and plunge into the heart of its newly emerging Church. Following an apostolic call on his life, Rick works alongside his wife Denise to see the Gospel preached, leadership trained, and the Church established throughout the world.  Today Rick's broadcast \"Good News With Rick Renner\" can be seen across the entire former USSR, reaching a potential audience of more than 100 million viewers. He has distributed hundreds of thousands of teaching audio and videotapes, and his best-selling books have been translated into five major languages - Spanish, Portuguese, French, Russian, and German - as well as multiple other languages that are spoken throughout the former Soviet Union. Rick is the founder of the Good News Association of Churches and Ministries, through which he assists and strengthens almost 700 churches in the territory of the former Soviet Union. He also pastors the fast-growing Moscow Good News Church, located in the very heart of Moscow, Russia. Rick Renner Ministries has offices in England, Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.

All the characters are based off of real people that were in my platoon.  We were a route clearance company and it was our job to find IEDs and dispose of them.  As anyone who has been deployed over seas would know, it can get really boring and monotonous.  Days melt together and it is easy to lose track of time.  I wrote these stories during my downtime to help pass the time.  They are all based around my mustache that I grew while overseas.  If there is one thing to be said about me it is that I grow an exceptional mustache, and it quickly grew popular with my company overseas.  These stories made for a good laugh and helped boost our morale.  While many of the jokes are better understood if you know the actual people being portrayed, I still think the stories are funny and wanted to share them with everyone.  They have become collectively known as the Flood Stache Sagas, and while they can be enjoyed individually they are best read in the order of How the Stache Saved Christmas, Love, Loss, and the Stache, and The Night of the Living Stache.

There will be no shortage of books devoted to analyzing these processes. In relative -- if not total -- shortage will be stories told by the actors who played major roles in this historical transformation. This rare and valuable volume, based on writings and stories of one of China's most influential economists and public intellectuals, Wu Jinglian, will serve that important function. It provides materials from a unique angle for contemporary readers to appreciate and understand the processes of China's reforms.(Wang Feng, Professor of Sociology, University of California, Non-resident Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution)Wu Jinglian has long been a critical figure in the Chinese reform process, at once an intellectual mastermind behind several key policies and a trenchant observer of the process as a whole. To the best of my knowledge, this book represents the first comprehensive English -- language presentation of Professor Wu's writings. Moreover those writings are coupled with insightful commentary by Barry Naughton, one of the world's foremost experts on the Chinese economy. This volume offers a crucial window onto the intellectual foundations of China's ongoing economic transformation.(Edward Steinfeld, Professor of Political Economy, MIT, and co-director of the China Energy Group in the MIT Industrial Performance Center)Naughton's focus on Wu Jinglian, whom he rightly identifies as a key contributor to the lengthy gestation of China's reform and marketization, is both attractive and timely. Naughton gives the reader a sense of the entire milieu in which debate and, eventually, Chinese reform occurred, as well as highlighting the issues and some of the personalities involved.(Thomas G.

Nelson was born in a little farmhouse on the prairie in eastern North Dakota in 1944. Some doctors made house calls back in those days. He remembers kerosene lamps, bathing in a large galvanized tub, and their phone number was a long ring followed by four short ones, and everybody in the neighborhood could rubberneck. (Imagine that today!) James has been telling stories most of his life. Some of his first memories happened during recess in a one-room country schoolhouse near Walcott, ND. His little friends, eyes wide, would gather round and listen to his every hastily-imagined word.  It was a beginning.  Fascinated by the world beginning to open, he remembers listening to the teacher read to all twelve kids in the eight grades. He was living in that same house on the land originally homesteaded by his great grandfather, when a savage tornado hit in 1955 and destroyed everything. They rebuilt and his family remained until the early nineteen-seventies when diversified farming began changing to industrial agribusiness (not necessarily a good thing.) He spent four years in the US Navy during the Vietnam War (USS Carbonero and USS Archerfish.) After the navy he worked many jobs and finally has settled on a few acres exactly two and one half miles straight west of  the original farmstead, ironically likely the very spot where the 1955 tornado first struck, which sometimes gives him a spooky feeling. This novel, Daughters, Book 2, Emma Gets Payback, along with Book 1, the Heartbreak of Human Trafficking, is a departure from his usual writing fare. He thinks the American public should be made more aware of what happens/can happen to abducted children, runaways, throwaways, street children…and, yes, even the so-called safe places of our schools, from middle to college, are not safe.", "related": ["B00JYQ9ZNY"], "rank": 1030392, "title": "Daughters Book 2: Emma Gets Payback", "author": "James W.

In 1976 I was raised in East New York Brooklyn by my church attending adopted parents who still serves as a deacon and deaconess up until this day.  From the age of two through nineteen they physically-verbally and mentally abused me. I was tortured, starved and neglected all through my childhood. Alcohol became an escape for me while I associated with people-men that added to the painful past of abuse. At the age of twenty five while walking into my first A.A. meeting is when I began to write the very first poem titled Being Alive.  From there I wrote Thirteen titles, 40 Ways To Please A Good Woman, 40 Ways To Please A Good Man, Only the Strong Can Survive, Aleja's Beautiful Poetic Strategy in Recovery, Poems from the Heart Mind Body and Soul, Passions Desires of Aleja the Poet, Thoughts Deeply Rooted Within Me, Seasons With And Without Love, All I Can Do Is Stand which and finally All I can Do Is Stand Part Two, Adopted Abused And Still Standing and Unlocking The Doors Of The Spoken Word and You Can't and Won't Stop Me From my Purpose which are all Available on paper back, kindle on Amazon.  You can say that I write not just to share a story but to empower-strengthen-encourage people all over the world. My mission has been to lift up the depressed-broken-wounded-injured-sad-addicts-abuse victims-teens-adopted children all over the world. My writing helps so many people as it allows inner healing to process within me faster. One of the goals is to stop the form of abuse or at least give people a desire to no longer deal with it. I writes for all ages excluding some of the romance poems that might not be suitable for certain ages. The majority of  my literature was written for all ages to read. My website link  http://staystrongandstand.com please donate to my organization for travel, speaking and book donations to people in need. On Oct. 17th 2013 I surrendered my life to God and has obediently accepted my calling.

Now, with this wonderful book, the glory, beauty, and majesty of God's creation in the San Juan Range of the Rocky Mountains can come to you wherever you live. As most of these devotions begins and ends with pertinent Bible verses, this devotional is a variety of thoughts, ideas, and inspirations derived from life in the Rocky Mountains. Many of us who live in the Rockies, including I am sure Julie and Candy, have had numerous reasons to realize the truth and the reality of the words of Psalm 121.Now, these God-sent, God-graced, God-gifted reflections of everyday life are yours to share as well through the pages of this exceptional devotional as we eachlift up our eyes to the hillshere in the midst of God's Cathedral, again and again and again. As one member of our congregation says so often and so well,this is a very special place.Read this book and you will understand that truth. --Rev. Rick Underwood, Lake City, Colorado Pastor, Community Presbyterian ChurchFor those of us who are blessed to live here in the Rocky Mountains, this devotional appropriately re-minds us that while we are rewarded with a constant panorama of God s grandeur and majesty, our true joy comes from serving the Lord with thankfulness, faith and grace in good times and bad. This book celebrates both the internal and external love that God has for his children, bigger and better than any mountain we can imagine! --Sue Uerling. Executive Director, Six Points Evaluation and Training, Gunnison, ColoradoSo much of life comes in moments, little slices, and short impressions. Julie and Candy have the ability to take these moments and polish them so that they shine and become praises. The writers know and feel that the mountains are special because everywhere you look there is the touch of God. This is not an ordinary devotional, it is a book that shows the reader how to praise God, one in which your thoughts bounce back and forth between scripture and those little slices of life in the Rocky Mountains. Mountain Devotional is a delightful set of reflections. --John W.

The Mountain Skulls are an outlaw MC, so the club action is gritty and exciting from their first introduction, and Elayne DiSano gives us a clear-eyed picture of the life these men and their women lead.Ben and Eva, the romantic leads and POVs, are richly developed characters with heartbreaking backstories. They meet on a dark night, their individual pain foremost in their minds, and as they begin to know each other, they begin to heal each other.Eva is a strong, lovely woman, a normal woman trying to live the best life she can on her own terms. Ben is a gorgeous mountain of a man, whose work for his club is dark but who manages to keep some light and love to share with the right woman. If ever he should meet her. Trust comes dear to Ben; he takes a huge risk to trust anyone, as he well knows. To let his guard down is itself an act of love for him.The world of Tippitt, like so many real small towns, is populated with interesting characters--some of them quirky, some of them hilarious, some of them mysterious, and some who are just regular people.There is heart-fluttering romance, smokin' hot sex, intrigue, danger and drama--and surprise--in a tight plot that snares Ben and Eva and threatens the tenuous peace they've found with each other. Just at the moment they need each other most, circumstances beyond them threaten to tear them apart.But true love is strong, and trust can move mountains.--Susan Fanetti, author of the Signal Bend Series", "related": ["B00JYFN3GA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 96, "rating_average": 4.4271, "rating_total": 425.0}

A daunting foray into an apocalyptic near future with a strong moral theme, the action comes fast and furious whilst the devices of suspense and tension are sure to keep the pages turning. It certainly isn't for the faint hearted and is decidedly graphic at times, as Morris imaginatively renders a multitude of backdrops which are clearly articulated and thoughtfully observed. Her plot rapidly evolving with an underlying and often evocative commentary on the weaknesses and ultimate failings of mankind in the absence of structure and law. It's actually quite thought provoking and Morris does well to bring the  the growing angst of her young protagonist to the fore, as she looks to her heart and must come to terms with a new order in which survival is everything. An ambitious and satisfying debut that bodes well for author Kate Morris and the next installment in this exciting new series, The McClane Apocalpyse is definitely recommended.-Book Viral Reviewby  author Stephan Myers", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 44.0}
