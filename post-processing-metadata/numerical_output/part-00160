In this book Linguistic Archaeology: An Introduction, he lets us take part in his adventures of recovering stone-age and medieval history by analysis of language.Analyzing the place names of the Odyssey, he made the interesting discovery that names and words may be interpreted as a shorthand, having been agglutinated from core words of the Basque language. He identified a subset of the Basque language, the core words of which have come through five millennia in almost unchanged form, as the nearest equivalent of the Neolithic universal language which has been spoken in Europe and the Near East before the 'Babylonian speech confusion.'Applying his new decoding method to names and words from many other language families, he arrived at the startling result that words of ancient languages like Sanskrit and Sumerian as well as of modern European languages like English, Spanish or German, can be decoded by the same method into Basque sentences revealing hidden meaning. This discovery is supporting the hypothesis of monogenesis of languages, according to Genesis 11.1: \"...now the whole earth had one language...\"As ancient words and names have come with meanings attached to them which cannot be substantiated by the hidden meaning decoded from them, a great deal of falsified or censored history can be recovered, revealing that many languages have been invented from the universal language, according to Genesis 11.7: \"...come, let us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Over 100,000 fans attended the \"celebration,\" proving their special devotion (or mania). Emmanuel (Extreme Encounters) focuses on the century-plus of heated battles between the two schools with a combination of humor and drama, frat-house intensity and more \"mature\" pride. The schools first tangled in 1897 and have been bashing each other yearly since (with a hiatus from 1913 to 1918). Some of the greatest coaches and players in college football, including Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, Archie Griffin and Charles Woodson, made their names in these heated affairs. Michigan has a 57–37 margin (with six ties), thanks in part to victories in their first 15 meetings. Emmanuel does a marvelous job of conveying not only the competition between the athletes but the ancillary bits and pieces—the less-than-ideal game conditions, the spirit of the marching bands and, in particular, the loyalty of classmates and family—that go into making this a special competition. Most of the book is devoted to the fans, however, who bask in the reflected glory of their team's success. For the stats nuts, Emmanuel offers an appendix including the results of each of the 100 games.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tax season was finally wrapping up, and none too soon for a poor, worn-out accountant. \"Sorry, Sugar—it'd be a long shot. The tax court is cracking down on what they regard as frivolous deductions and I doubt we could get it past them. We can write off your costumes and the tinted latex nipple makeup, but that's about it. No personal care like tanning, manicures or hair extensions.\"\"And we can't appeal? I only got the implants for professional reasons, you know.\" Sugar pursed her pink glossy lips.Keeley had known her friend and client too long to fall for her act. She peered over the tops of her glasses. \"And you get no personal benefits from them?\"Sugar smacked her arm playfully. \"Oh, all right, you naughty girl. I didn't lose any nerve sensation from the surgery and my last boyfriend and I did enjoy them.\"\"Thought so.\" Keeley pushed her glasses back up her nose to focus on the computer again. \"And if we make an issue over this, the IRS might want to look in to how much of your cash tips you've been reporting as income.\" Keeley wasn't a novice to IRS audits, but didn't exactly enjoy them, either.\"Hmmph.\" Sugar backed down, like Keeley thought she would. As a certified public accountant, Keeley couldn't take part in tax evasion in the form of under-reporting garter or G-string tips, but she had a good idea that Sugar salted away her own personal cash stash, and who could blame her? Keeley would do the exact same thing in the same situation.But Keeley was on the straight and narrow, just taking the figures Sugar gave her and plugging them into the tax program, although sometimes she raised an eyebrow at an obviously low figure. Sugar would revise it upward without blinking.Keeley added in a couple of last-minute expenses Sugar had brought over today. Sugar, not one to sit still for any period of time, paced around the small office. Her long legs took her rapidly from one terra-cotta faux-painted wall to the other, the beige Berber carpet muffling her sneaker-clad steps. Like some dancers, Sugar had foot problems and only wore high heels onstage and on dates.Keeley rotated her own brown-pump-clad foot under her desk. Her shoes matched her hair, her eyes, her jacket and her skirt. She was a big brown wren in comparison to her flashier blond friend, but accountants couldn't exactly sport cleavage T-shirts and midthigh denim miniskirts.Sugar stopped to eye a pair of watercolor prints of Florence, Italy. Keeley had never been there, but the red tile roofs matched the whole rich, Tuscan, trust-me-with-your-finances theme she wanted to emphasize. After all, accountants working in Renaissance Florence had invented double-entry bookkeeping.Keeley printed the return and eyed it one last time before passing the pages to Sugar. \"Read these over before I file electronically.\"Sugar sat and speed-read through the papers. She looked as if she was skimming, but Keeley knew she was tallying every number to the penny. She finally raised her blond head and smiled. \"I suppose that's as good as it gets without writing off the breast implants.\"Keeley shrugged, palms upward. \"If you really want me to try…\"\"No, I guess not. After all, pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered.\" Sugar signed the bottom page for her own records.\"That's right.\" Keeley'd heard that saying more than once growing up in downstate Illinois. Not that there had been enough to even get slightly plump on. \"Off it goes to Uncle Sam. Since you've made your quarterly payments, you don't owe any more than usual.\"\"Whoopee. I'll have to schedule myself at Frisky's a couple more nights to make up for it.\"\"If any of your clients work for the IRS, charge them double.\" And now that Keeley's highest-earning season was almost over, she'd have to save her money to make it last as long as possible until next winter.Sugar passed the papers to Keeley. \"By the way, Keel, I recommended your accounting services to an old friend of mine.\"\"Oh, who?\" That might help tide her over while she built her client base.Sugar grinned. \"Binky Bingham.\"\"Boy, when you said 'old,' you weren't kidding. I thought he croaked last fall after hot-tubbing with that dancer from Chicago Gentlemen's Club.\" And why on earth would Binky Bingham, billionaire, need accounting services from her fledgling business?\"Alive and kicking. He's still one of her regulars, in and out of the club.\"Keeley made a face. Binky fancied himself quite the ladies' man and had the money to make it so. Sugar was Binky's occasional arm candy, especially when he wanted to scare his children and grandchildren into thinking he was going to leave his money to her. He was lucky they hadn't had him declared legally incompetent and locked him up somewhere.Sugar laughed. \"Don't look at me like that. Aside from dancing for him at Frisky's, I sure never spent any time naked with him, hot tub or no.\"\"That's a relief.\" Binky Bingham was older than dirt and twice as ugly. Keeley was glad to hear Sugar hadn't slept with the old goat.\"You're telling me. Not even all of his money would be enough. For such a financial genius, he sure wasn't thinking with the right head. Viagra, a hot tub and a previous heart attack? Why didn't he just step in front of a bus? Potentially less fatal and definitely less embarrassing.\"\"You know Binky is incapable of embarrassment.\"Sugar raised a perfectly French-manicured finger. \"Personally, no. But professionally, yes. That's why your name came up.\" She leaned over the desk. \"You absolutely cannot tell anyone what I'm going to tell you. Promise?\"Keeley narrowed her eyes. \"I can't be party to anything illegal, you know that.\"Her friend shook her head. \"Not illegal—not so far.\"\"So far? Sugar, this doesn't sound good at all.\"\"It's about Binky's company. He thinks one of his executives is stealing money from the trust funds.\"Keeley gave an astonished whistle. Bingham Brothers was the granddaddy of Chicago's financial companies, managing hundreds of millions of dollars since before the 1929 stock market crash. \"It's possible, of course, but there are so many safeguards to theft. These huge companies have hundreds of people overseeing the books.\"\"Binky grew up with those books, and he has a gut feeling they're bad. He went into the office several times to poke around and says the atmosphere is pure poison.\"\"Hmmm.\" Keeley turned over possibilities in her mind. \"Why doesn't Binky call for an audit?\"\"And flush his company's reputation down the toilet? Not to mention his family's reputation. Hot-tub hijinks are one thing, but missing money is unforgivable.\"Keeley nodded. A whiff of scandal and the company would bottom out. It had happened before to Chicago financial firms, usually involving bankruptcy, corporate dissolution and prison terms. \"So what does Binky think I can do? I can't exactly walk in off the street and look at the books. It would take months for a whole team of auditors to examine everything.\"\"He has a smaller, specific group of accounts to audit first. When I told him you'd completed a certificate in forensic accounting, his wrinkly little face just lit up. He said his representative would be in touch to get you inside for a covert audit.\"\"A covert audit?\" Despite her misgivings, Keeley's investigative antennae perked up. She loved digging for money, ever since she was a kid checking the couch for loose change.\"So you'll do it? Binky knows absolutely everybody and can get you on the fast track if he recommends you to his friends. And you know you can bill him a bundle.\"Binky would probably expect her to bill a respectable hourly consultant fee. She wouldn't gouge him, but she could legitimately bill more for doing the audit on the sly, and probably expert witness fees as well if it became a matter for the courts. Although she'd worked her way through school and had no student debt, she did have obligations. \"I'll listen to what his representative says. Did he say who that is?\"\"No names were mentioned, just that he was one of Binky's protégés and totally trustworthy.\"Keeley snorted and Sugar giggled. Men were so naive.Nobodywas totally trustworthy, especially when large sums of money were concerned.\"I WOULD HAVE BEEN happy to come to your office, Binky.\" Dane Weiss leaned over the small table to shout into his elderly friend's ear over the pulsing rock music. \"Or your condo.\" Penthouse, rather, overlooking Lake Michigan and the rest of the city. Binky had an entire floor in Lakenheath Towers, one of Chicago's most exclusive buildings.But Binky preferred a different kind of penthouse— the kind with naked women in it. \"And miss the lunchtime show at Frisky's? At my age, I can't stay awake for the evening show.\" He cackled and gestured expansively to the nubile chicks cavorting above them on the runway. One flipped over and slid down a pole using just her thighs, and Dane winced. He'd never figured how they did that without friction burns, but probably some trick of the trade involving baby powder.It wasn't as if he were a stranger to these places, having worked his way through grad school as Binky's driver/personal assistant, but he did his best to ignore the buffet of female flesh literally spread in front of him. He wasn't there for a lap dance—not that Binky would mind if he did partake.Although the lunchtime dancers weren't quite the A-string team in their G-strings, Binky didn't care. With his overtipping, he was the life of the party. \"Here, sweetheart, this is for you.\" He slipped a fifty into the nearest girl's garter.Dane tried to stop him, not because Binky had to watch his pennies, but because the other girls spotted Ulysses S. Grant's bearded scowl and flocked to...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After observing salmon and shrimp farms, especially in Maine and Mexico, and speaking with those who support and oppose aquaculture, Molyneaux (The Doryman's Reflection), who has been a fisherman himself, presents some disturbing facts. For example, farmed fish suffer from diseases, and the antibiotics used to treat them can enter the food chain and lead to the proliferation of disease-resistant bacteria. In addition, fish farms use pesticides that contaminate the ocean; wild fish have to be caught to feed farmed fish, resulting in further decimation of already depleted wild fish stocks; and there's a danger of genetic pollution when farmed fish escape and crossbreed with wild fish. Molyneaux's argument gets hazy when it wanders into a discussion of ecological economics, and offers no alternatives to aquaculture other than vague proposals that fishermen take a more active role in wild stock preservation. But he is mostly able to use his firsthand knowledge of the fishing industry to make a powerful case against aquaculture.

After serving as a nose gunner on a B-24 Liberator Bomber in World War II he attended Oklahoma A&M; College in Stillwater, Oklahoma and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Ft. Worth, Texas. His ministry in Oklahoma included a mission church in Mehan, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Jennings, and served four and one half years as Southern Baptist's first missionary to the Cheyenne Indians near Hammon. Frank taught school for three years during these early years of ministry. He and Betty Jo Howard of Duncan, Oklahoma married in 1951 and they have three children, James Barnes, Judy Gregory and Jean Kelso who live in Texas. Frank spent thirty-five years in the Northwest where he was pastor of the First Baptist Church in Kellogg, Idaho for six and one-half years and pastor of Pines Baptist Church, Spokane, Washington for twenty-six years. While living in Spokane he served ten years as a trustee for the Golden Gate Baptist Seminary in Mill Valley, California, and two years as president of the Northwest Baptist Convention. After retiring as pastor he was Director of Missions in the Coulee Baptist Association in Washington. Frank has developed a unique study of the Tabernacle using reproductions of each piece of furniture in the exact size and shape of those used in the Old Testament. The study reveals how the Tabernacle and each piece of furniture portray some aspect of the person and ministry of Christ. This program has been presented many times and in ten different states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Missouri, Tennessee, Arkansas, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. Frank has self-published two books, From Hay Creek To Heaven and B-24 Nose Gunner and a number of other booklets and tracts.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here he invites his readers into a vivid conversation with one who attempts to challenge the absolute nature of truth and step by step shows us that such truth is real and can be known. Students will find his work especially helpful and winsome as they encounter conflicting ideas in the university. This is an outstanding piece of work and I highly recommend it.\" (Ravi Zacharias, author and speaker)\"Art Lindsley, an able Christian scholar and advocate, has tackled the central issue of our time--truth.

The chronology and the  bibliography have been updated as well.A comprehensive survey of the Hindu tradition, the book deals with the  history of Hinduism, the sacred writings of the Hindus, the Hindu  worldview, and the specifics of the major branches of Hinduism--Vaisnavism,  Saivism, and Saktism. It also focuses on the geographical ties of Hinduism  with the land of India, the social order created by Hinduism, and the  various systems of Hindu thought. Klaus K. Klostermaier describes the  development of Hinduism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,  including present-day political Hinduism and the efforts to turn Hinduism  into a modern world religion. A unique feature of the book is its treatment  of Hinduism in a topical fashion, rather than by chronological description  of the development of Hinduism or by summary of the literature. The  complexities of Hindu life and thought are thus made real to the reader,  and Hindus will recognize it as their own tradition.Praise for the Second Edition\"The first edition of this book appeared in 1989 and rapidly proved its  worth as a textbook on Hinduism that was more inclusive and accessible than  most--especially for Western readers ... Although not meant primarily for  specialists, it was so complete in its presentation of Hinduism that  specialists found a place for it on their shelves as a ready reference ...  This book offers the most comprehensive, balanced, accessible and yet  deeply scholarly presentation of Hinduism in English.\" -- Harold Coward inPacific Affairs", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Voter turnout often surpassed 75%, political scandals were abundant, and odd third parties and flamboyant figures captured the public eye. The era has given Calhoun plenty to chew on, and the author, manifestly passionate about his niche, suggests that we are missing the implications of the historical drama. Unfortunately, by filling his book with a bewilderingly pedestrian barrage of facts, he fails to draw a persuasive parallel. Either too determined to be brief, or too loyal to his single-minded premise, Calhoun's summary of the era's politics is scholarly, complete, and bone dry. While its central impetus, the shifting balance between the influence on politics of moral issues and brute economics, is a worthy anchor point, the sheer stultifying force of endless dithering over tariffs, monetary policy, in-fighting, and partisan bickering is too strong.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

It's not life imitating art, but a strange admixture of both where the boundary lines between the two are no longer visible.

But what's even greater is; how He can make the worst situations that happened in our lives, be ones that take us to places that not only make His name great; but ours as well. In Authoress T. Tamyra Eddy's latest work, 'The Search For Me' (The 1st in The Journey series), I am reminded of just that; how amazing God really is! Her journey from pain to forgiveness was one that re-awakened my spiritual senses. The testimonial words that flowed off the pages took me on a literal journey with her. I went from crying in agreement to rejoicing in triumph because I could see portions of my life playing before me; in written form...and I hadn't told a soul! Long story short; if she can take my life; live it, breathe it, and even write about it, down the path of forgiveness, while on a journey in search of who God has called her to be; I am absolutely certain she has done so for others! This memoir is an eye-opener that will have you wanting more, just so you can see how not only her journey will end, but possibly yours! - Author A. Life... --AUthor A.Life...As we travel through life, there are different paths we can choose to take and different paths we NEVER wanted to experience. T.Tamyra Eddy expresses her journey through life in her new book titled The Search for Me . How do you find yourself when you have experienced, betrayal from loved ones? How do you find yourself when you have been faced with adultery? How do you find yourself when the ones who are suppose to protect you, violate your innocence and you still love them? How do you find yourself when you have to learn to forgive? These are all questions that we may all be able to relate to that this book reveals. Some things in life are kept secret but really need to be released not only for self but for others. As you read this book, search for the inner you that may have struggled with forgiving a loved one, or being molested. --Ashantia Salter", "related": [], "rank": 4773218, "title": "The Search for Me (The Journey Book 1) eBook", "author": "T.

It's not easy to write a short and spicy story but I consider\nthis a perfect novella to wet your feet in light BDSM if you've never\nread this sub-genre in romance. The author brings together the perfect\nblend of fantasy and eroticism that weaves a sizzling tale of discovery\nand acceptance that ends in such a way that will leave you with a warm\nsmile of satisfaction. \"4.5 Stars - Night Owl Romance\"This story drew me in and kept me reading. It's emotionally hot and\n very well written. I think anyone who likes BDSM stories needs to meet\n Gavin and Josie, I think you'll like them.\"5 Lips - Two Lips Reviews\"I was so giddy when Stacey announced she was trying her hand at\nwriting a BDSM story. I've recently fallen in love with this theme in my\n romance and I couldn't wait to see what she'd do. For me, Stacey's\nbooks have always packed a powerful punch and given this is a short\nstory, I was hoping that I would still get a taste, as well as the heat\nthat comes the Dom/sub dynamics. Let me tell you - Stacey definitely\nknows how to deliver and my only disappointment was it just wasn't long\nenough. But... she could write an epic 1000 page novel and I'd still say\nit wasn't long enough. Forever Bound was a fun short story that had\ngreat chemistry between the two characters and left me sighing at the\nend! I had no problem picturing what was happening and it definitely got\n my blood pumping.

I was a little skeptical at first wondering how good it would be since it was written by two authors. However, the...editing is great. Everything flows smoothly, which sucked me into the story. I particularly loved the relationship between Gabi and her father. Another detail I liked, is that the authors address the relationships of side characters as well, including Gabi's dad and Frey's brother. This is great for me, because I often wonder what happens to the side characters in stories. The romance in this book is definitely young adult, as there are no sex scenes and just a few displays of affection. Of course, the lack of affection is partially a result of Gabi and Frey fighting their feelings for so long. The scenes where they do show affection are quite touching though. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read young adult type stories. It has a sweet romance, but has just enough danger and mystery woven throughout the romance to make it interesting.  ***** Review by Tasheka GipsonMember of the Paranormal Romance Guild", "related": [], "rank": 2490795, "title": "S'nat Wars: Fifth Anniversary Edition", "author": "Linda Palmer", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tales of Wal-Mart’s unsavory business practices (witness the class-action suit currently before the Supreme Court) are fertile ground for business books, television and film documentaries and the like, and this book is one more entry into the field. What makes Hood’s tale different is the fact that he owned a business that was literally driven into bankruptcy by the retailing behemoth. The story revolves around a product Hood’s company devised called the “Shopper’s Calculator,” which attached to a shopping cart, helping shoppers determine what they were spending. The product could also serve up advertising for various name brands as well as for Wal-Mart’s store brands. Through a detailed account that includes references to letters, phone calls and meetings, Hood documents the sorry story of how Wal-Mart management, at best, ineptly implemented a promotional program that they agreed to support, and, at worst, sabotaged it because of a perverted ego- and profit-driven arrogance Hood calls “egonomics.” In diary-like entries, Hood presents dates of specific occurrences and includes copies of documents that are hard to dispute, resulting in a uniformly unfavorable view of Wal-Mart’s way of doing business. In fact, the story culminates in Hood’s company filing a $40-million lawsuit against Wal-Mart, which he says was settled for “the discounted amount of $23.5 million.” Even after the lawsuit, however, Hood’s company continued to do business with Wal-Mart and, remarkably, the same people who initially undermined the relationship, says Hood, held “very cooperative and productive meetings” over the next two years. Nevertheless, Hood suggests Wal-Mart’s decision to cancel the contract after three-and-a-half years was premeditated and vindictive, as research proved the program did work. Clearly, Hood is anything but an objective observer and occasionally his emotion gets the better of him. But he writes well and tells his story with equal doses of irony and outrage. It will likely be difficult for the reader not to accept the author’s claim that Wal-Mart is a corporate villain after reading this book. A well-crafted, personal tale of business gone bad.", "related": [], "rank": 3735509, "title": "Wal-Mart's EGOnomics, Always -- The Greed Behind the Smiley Face eBook", "author": "Charles H.

Using his experience as a U.S. Naval officer, and his extensive experience in the aerospace industry, he began his first novel in 1976 with a story about an attempt by North Korean special forces to hijack a U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. Fifteen years later Raid On Truman was published in hardbound and paperback and was translated into Japanese for hardbound and paperback sales in Japan. That was the fulfillment of a dream to become a published novelist. He sold a second novel on the heels of the first. COBRA DANE was published in paperback in 1995. A third novel, Sub Zero, quickly followed and was published in 1996 along with publication in Japan. John has written four more novels, Vauclain’s Shield, Hidden Sun, These Final Hours, and The Telekinetic Man and a screenplay derived from The Telekinetic Man and is in the process of trying to sell them.  Another book was published in 2003 just before the Iraqi War. Desert War was a nonfiction look at how the war might be conducted, weapons systems, intelligence gathering, and forces on both sides. While John was the author, his daughter, Christine researched the work.  Influenced initially by the works of Ian Fleming and his brand of no-holds-barred action and intrigue, John has tried to bring to readers that same action elements, but with a large dose of sobering reality. Violence has profound consequences and the characters within John's novels feel all the passion and agony of real people. Raid On Truman, COBRA DANE, Sub Zero, Vauclain's Shield, These Final Hours, The Telekinetic Man, and Hidden Sun are available on Amazon's Kindle Store. Note that COBRA DANE has for its cover image a picture of the actual COBRA DANE radar on the island of Shemya in the Aleutians. Vauclain's Shield's cover image has a photo of actual reentry vehicles passing through the atmosphere over Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and Raid On Truman has a real picture of the USS Harry Truman taken by the author.         A collection of fourteen sci-fi/horror/paranormal short stories, A Case of the Vapors was added to the Kindle store in August 2013. These stories run the gamut from the humorous A Case of the Vapors to the somber, but hopeful, The Iron Sergeant.

I want people to grow up feeling free and empowered, happy and enthusiastic about their lives, confident, self-assured, and open to unlimited possibilities. I start with my family's experiences and share what we've learned so far.Our children are our best teachers and our hope for a learning and growing world. Children are precious.

Between the summers of 2001 and 2006 he wrote and drew the weekly comic strip 9-Banded, focusing on the travails and trials of an armadillo and his human companion. During this time he co-created the unintentionally avant-garde comic book series The Lumpish One and founded Poorly Made Films, an Indianapolis-based amateur film production team. Felton has since written and directed five feature-length films, a bevy of bizarre short films, and authored two novels.

Andrea, however did not follow that timeline, in fact her passion for personal finance began at an early age--with her first stock purchase in sixth grade! Andrea's money education continued at the University of Iowa with a degree in finance. Upon completion Andrea took a position in banking. With additional career opportunities to follow that involved working in corporate finance with budgets and forecasts, taxes, and retirement investing both in the United States and abroad in Australia. During this time Andrea completed her MBA from Creighton University. Upon returning to the United States Andrea decided to make the jump to entrepreneurship and was hooked. After starting two businesses (event planning and wine tasting classes), Andrea realized that her true calling was to help people achieve their goals. However she also knew from her financial experience that the one thing in most people's way to their goals is their money. Your money and life fulfillment are intertwined and both must be healthy and on target in order to embrace your personal power and achieve your goals. Because of this belief Andrea formed Smart Step, Inc in 2007 to educate people about money and to help them make the world a better place. Knowing that many times money problems have more to do with behavior Andrea became a certified coach in 2009 so that in addition to education she can help others overcome the mental and behavior road blocks. In her spare time she enjoys time with her husband and son. She also enjoys the pool, reading, creating new ideas for more businesses and of course learning even more about personal finance!

With the aid of an idealistic lawyer, she determines the best course of action to procure the young activists’ release from one of the government’s most notorious prisons, but government and prison officials claim they are not even holding the group. She is joined in her efforts by brilliant prison psychologist Yudel Gordon and seems to have gained the favor of one of the secret police’s high-level bureaucrats, Jonas Chunga. But what does Chunga really want from her, and why is she so willing to put her marriage vows aside?

With news of World War II in the background and the price of Ann Page spaghetti at two cans for 13?, Kaminsky's private eye wends his way through the Hollywood hills, hunting for the killers and running into the likes of Ernest Hemingway. Along the way, Toby stumbles over corpses, avoids stray bullets, and tries to keep from being turned into a Kosher hot dog by some menacing East Coast thugs. Despite these promising elements, though, the story line and characters are weak. Narrator Christopher Lane makes a gallant effort to infuse some life into this audiobook but to little avail.

She also cogently explains the relationship between emotion and decision-making, and argues that the human brain is wired with an inherent morality that includes a sense of fairness, a desire to do no harm, a respect for authority, and a sense of purity. All of this serves as prologue for Johnson s central aim: how to put this knowledge to work to live a happier life and contribute to a healthier social community. Her prescriptions are basic: live a life consistent with basic morality, get adequate sleep and exercise, nourish good relationships, and make conscious use of critical faculties. Mundane or not, these suggestions are more than latitudes when reinforced by the sophisticated description of the brain s functioning. Readers will appreciate Johnson s accessible explanation of complex processes. --PW Publishers Weekly Select, April 2012.I would highly recommend this book to all parents and educators and anyone interested in understanding the basis and continuing development of human behavior. Dr. Johnson has done a masterful job translating complex neuroanatomy and the latest findings in neuroimaging into an easily understood text that provides fascinating new insights into the plasticity of neuronal connections that underlie our behavior and response to our day-to-day social experience. With thoughtful examples that we can all relate to, Dr. Johnson explains how very early experiences can direct thought patterns and behaviors for better and for worse. Importantly, she uses recent discoveries in neuroscience to emphasize that these default patterns are in fact plastic and can be consciously modified once recognized and addressed. For teachers and parents, she gives annotated examples of how to create and reinforce positive healthy thought patterns, and [she] provides a recommended environment for optimal learning and memory for the developing brain in the classroom and at home. This book gave me new insights and awareness into the origin of my own thought processes and how our brains are constantly filtering and adjusting to social experiences. Despite its scientific basis, this is ultimately a book about the power of optimism, hope and love in shaping a healthy brain. Dr. Johnson s unique perspective on brain function and behavior can indeed change your thinking and your outlook on life. --Prof. S. Jill James, Ph.D., University of Arkansas Medical School, Customer review, Amazon.Dr. Elaine Johnson has written a fascinating book on how the brain works, and . . . how we can use this knowledge to live our lives more productively. I was very impressed by how she makes . . . neuroscience so plainly and directly understandable . . . [using] examples from everyday life. It s a small book, . . . easy to read, and each chapter builds effortlessly on the last. To me, as an ex-educator and parent of three grown children, it is a book that should be on every teacher and community leader s necessary list. How important is it to know that we can actually change and improve our brains (and therefore our lives); that they are not stuck in one IQ test result forever? --Dorothy Bennett, Director emeritus, Technical Education, Swinburne University, Melbourne, Australia.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I chose to read this book after receiving a request from the author as I love romantic suspense. However, I have never read anything like this. The book doesn't waste anytime getting with character or location set up or description. The action begins immediately as well as the love story.This book was a very quick read because the action started so soon, I had to find out why. The pages turned very quickly. I liked both main characters. Allie was a great heroine. Strong, but not so much that she became unbelievable. She was tough and could survives the situations by herself or with little help. I also liked Jase as the hero. I instantly liked him. I was intrigued with the situation he had created for his life and how he handled things. I do have to say that my least favorite character was Max. I did not like him even in the beginning.Not only was it just the suspense story and the romance story, but the story involving family and friends that made this a great novel. If you like romantic suspense, you should definitely read this book.\"-Date With a Book Blog******\"Cindy Stark has earned a permanent place on my bookshelf.

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, poisoning or simply battering a person to death. As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My first novel, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees' is set in a small town in France. It is published by Author Way Limited. Author Way has already published the next three novels in the series, 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,' ‘Red Light in the Pyrenees’ and 'Dead End in the Pyrenees' as well as a collaboration of short stories called 'Twists and Turns'. As I live in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. When I first arrived in this region I was lulled by the gentle pace of life, the friendliness of the people and the simple charm of the place. But dig below the surface and, like people and places the world over, the truth begins to emerge. Petty squabbles, prejudice, jealousy and greed are all there waiting to be discovered. Oh, and what joy in that discovery. So, as I sit in a café, or stroll by the riverside, or walk high into the mountains in the sunshine I greet everyone I meet with a smile and a 'Bonjour' and, being a friendly place, they return the greeting. I people watch as I sip my wine or when I go to buy my baguette. I discover quirkiness and quaintness around every corner. I try to imagine whether the subjects of my scrutiny are nice or nasty and, once I've decided, some of those unsuspecting people, a very select few, I kill. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim. But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there.

I had returned to Japan for a third time to look for work, and ended up in a crummy little school owned by a crazed Singaporean woman who needed a native speaker of English to tutor her students.I had Mondays off, and I wanted to leave teaching and get back to journalism, or some writing related profession. So I would often go into the center of Tokyo for job interviews. I lived and worked in Adachi Ward, the farthest district from the city center.I didn't have any interviews set up for that morning fortunately. But it was my habit to wait for the rush hour to die down, and to head off to the more interesting neighborhoods on my day off. Luckily, that morning I turned on the television.What I saw was horrifying. Victims of some kind of gas were spilling out of subway entrances all over the center of Tokyo. I did not understand Japanese very well, but I had pretty good idea of what was happening. Only a few weeks before, I had read an in-depth article in the English-languageTokyo Journalabout an alleged poison gas accident in the mountain town of Matsumoto the previous year. I had read that this incident may have been caused by the mixing of pesticides found in a garden shed that was owned by a retired chemical company salesman. Eight died and hundreds more injured. It was plausible, and like many in the public, I believed it, and didn't give it much thought.The article, though, said it was much more likely the work of a secretive cult, Aum Shinrikyo, which had a motive to attack the village. The alleged perpetrator simply did not have the chemicals and expertise to make sarin, a nerve gas first developed by the Nazis. While his wife was in coma as a result of the attack. The police made his life into a living hell as they continued to call him a suspect.Now, gas had been released in multiple trains, suggesting a coordinated attack.Needless to say, I wasn't going into the city center that day. Instead, I watched TV all day as the reports of deaths and serious injuries mounted. The media coverage was nonstop. Many of my students commuted to jobs in Tokyo, and some of them caught whiffs of the gas. None of them were seriously injured.  They all had stories of friends and family members who were victimized.It turned out that the police had been letting the cult literally get away with murder for years. A partially blind guru, Shoko Asahara, had amassed a fortune, and managed to attract young, educated followers who believed in his apocalyptic vision of a future where everyone but members of the cult would perish, and they would remain to rebuild the world. This was an activist doomsday cult. It wasn't waiting for the world to end. It wanted to make it happen. It had amassed enough chemicals to kill every man and woman on the planet. (It never devised a way to deliver them, though.)The idea to writeThe Song of Sarincame to me several years later after I had retired as a world traveler and returned to journalism and the United States. You don't live through something like that without it sticking in your subconscience.Those who are familiar with the incident know that Aum Shinrikyo cultists released sarin in five subway lines as they were arriving at the seat of the Japanese government during rush hour. What isn't as well known is that the cult intended to attack six trains, but it hadn't mixed up a large enough batch of the nerve gas.TheSong of Sarinimagines that six trains were attacked. Junichi , or Siha, is the fictional sixth terrorist.Other than the invented characters and the incidents surrounding them,The Song of Sarinis quite factual. The major cult figures in the novel are real people, and the horrific crimes they committed in the name of the guru in the novel actually happened. I wanted to get into the mind of an ordinary person who was brainwashed into murdering innocents. I read several academic studies. Among them:Religious Violence in Contemporary Japan: The Case of Aum Shinrikyoby Ian Reader;Destroying the World to Save Itby Robert Jay Lifton andAum Shinrikyo and Japanese Youthby Daniel A. Metreax. The renown Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami wroteUnderground, an excellent nonfiction book focusing on the victims of the attack rather than the perpetrators. Shoko Asahara wanted to spread his message to the world and had many books published in English. Just about every word of his dialogue inTheSong of Sarincame from his own writings, which I tracked down on used book websites.Finally, while writing the novel some five years after the incident, I was frustrated that I didn't know the Chiyoda line or the neighborhoods where the attackers would have boarded and alit from the train if it had been attacked as originally planned. I informed my editor at the publication I worked for at the time that I was going to Tokyo for a vacation, and I would write him some articles if he would spring for the plane ticket and some expenses. He agreed, and so I was able to return to Tokyo to ride on the Chiyoda line and imagine what it would have been like to be in that car as nerve gas slowly overtook the passengers.I self-publishedThe Song of Sarinin 2003. I did little to find a traditional publisher. I had been working on novels in my grandmother's basement off and on for years, and as she grew older, she hadn't yet seen one of them in print. So I skipped the traditional publishing route and paid Xlibris to produce it. She was very happy to finally see a book with my name on the cover.Some nine years later, I decided it was time to rerelease it on Kindle.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We met in 1984 in court in Sydney's far western suburbs in Australia covering the murder trial of 43 bikies charged with shooting seven people at the Viking Tavern.We visited jails, met the leader of the Bandidos the week before he hanged himself and ran away from bull terriers. This book was a baptism of fire for two young journalists. It was the first book in Australia to tackle true crime using creative nonfiction.Now all those years later, they've made a miniseries based on our book which screens in Australia this month. It's amazing how close they've stuck to our original script. The miniseriesBikies At War, Brothers In Armsshould be traveling overseas to an outlet near you.Seven people died that day at the Viking Tavern, the biggest 'massacre' on Australian soil since colonial days. This story has lived on and has become a legend in the bikie world and many myths have sprung up around this story. The book is written using Truman Capote's 'faction' style so it reads like a novel but it's based on three year of painstaking research including attending bikie parties, dressing up as bikie molls to get inside the Parklea jail and interviewing police, lawyers, bikies, old ladies and eye witnesses. Hope you enjoy it.After writing Brothers in Arms, I used my experience as a journalist to explore all sorts of other cases: interviewing a serial killer in jail with my best friend Sandra. My most recent book is written with co-author Jennifer Cooke and is the case of Gabe Watson who was charged with murdering his new bride, Tina Watson, while scuba diving on their honeymoon. He was recently acquitted in a Birmingham court in Alabama. I also wrote a book with Walter Mikac whose wife and two children were gunned down during the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in southern Australia where 35 people lost their lives. The second book I wrote with Sandra, My Husband My Killer, was also made into a telemovie - it was about a millionaire Yugoslav hotelier who was convicted of hiring a hitman to kill his wife. He has just recently been released from jail after serving a lifetime in jail. It was recently made into a series for Discovery Channel on Killers Inside Mansion Doors.My life as a police reporter, begun in my early 20s, has taken me down a path of mystery and intrigue.

Laski was a proponent of Marxism and believed in a planned economy based on the public ownership of the means of production. Instead of as he saw it, a coercive state, Laski believed in the evolution of co-operative states that were internationally bound and stressed social welfare. He also believed since the capitalist class would not acquiesce in its own liquidation, the cooperative commonwealth was not likely to be attained without violence. But he also had a commitment to civil liberties, free speech and association, and representative democracy. Initially he believed that the League of Nations would bring about a \"international democratic system\". However from the late 1920s his political beliefs became radicalized and he believed that it was necessary to go beyond capitalism to \"transcend the existing system of sovereign states\". Laski was dismayed by the Hitler-Stalin pact and wrote a preface to the Left Book Club collection criticising it, Betrayal of the Left. In his last years he was disillusioned by the Cold War and the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. George Orwell described him as \"A socialist by allegiance, and a liberal by temperament\".", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I recommend this book as a fantastic\nbedtime story to read to your children. However, if you have children of seven\nor older (depending on their reading age), they will be able to read it for\nthemselves, as there are no \"big\" words that would confuse them. -\nLynn Worton (WaAR)                                            ***A Boy Named Ray Revieweponareviews.blogspot.co.uk/p/a-boy-named-ray-review.htmlI am at a loss for words with this novel.

In 1991, two years after leaving the NUM, Jones won the coveted Newspaper Society Yorkshire Journalist of the Year award. Jones, whose formal education ended at 15 when he joined the Merchant Navy, is a rarity among writers: a self-taught man who overcame huge personal obstacles to write this, his first novel, at a time when most people seek a quiet retirement.  A private pilot for over 20 years, he currently lives in Lancashire and spends part of the year on a small island in Finland, where he does much of his writing.  Jones has been married to his Finnish wife, Leena, for over 40 years. They have one daughter.

I felt I was at a crossroads in my life and had to decide if I should finally take a leap and further my education, try a different field of work, or just stick it out at my current job, which paid ok and had a great benefit package--very important with four kids.  After months on my knees, seeking guidance, the idea to write a book came into my mind. Write a book?! I was sure I'd received an answer to someone else’s prayer. But, the idea wouldn't go away. So, with a background in fitness, I set out to write a non-fiction book on personal health and exercise. As I began to collect ideas, it just didn’t feel right. I asked again. It didn’t take long before the feeling hit me that I should write a novel. A novel!? I had NEVER written ANYTHING creative in my life! Yet, the urgency I felt to write would not subside. I began a new education in the world of writing and became an eager student.  I made a list of goals for my book. Some goals on my list included: unique, unpredictable, and real. I hate it when characters react to real-life situations by doing something unbelievable or far-fetched. It would also need to be fast paced, have characters which were both likeable and relatable, a story that would keep readers guessing until the very end, and would--at some point--make them want to throw the book across the room. Let me clarify that last one. My favorite author, Matthew Reilly, is the master of this, like when he kills off a favorite character, for example, then later on, you find out that the character is not dead. You think “Oh, that #&*@$, he did it to me again!” I love that!! It took me thirteen months to complete the first two books in my Second Chances series. Now, I leave it up to my readers to decide if I hit the goals on my list. It's been both a fun-filled and trying experience, and I’ve been tested extensively in my life since I started this new career path. But, by discovering a talent I never knew I had, I've found a passion which will stay with me for the rest of my life. To anyone who's ever dared to chase a dream, I leave you with this quote I have in my living room. “Only by daring the ridiculous can you achieve the impossible.” J.K.

From rustic post-Civil War days when Camden poet Walt Whitman crossed the Delaware River on a ferry or caroused Market Street \"eyeing\" the grocery boys, to the beginnings of ACT UP more than one hundred years later, the gay and lesbian community in Phildelphia has never lost its flair for the dramatic.Gay And Lesbian Philadelphia is a historical look at the neighborhoods, events, and people that have been a part of this community. The 1920s saw the birth of private dance bars on Rittenhouse Square. It was a time when drag shows in straight bars were the order of the day, as was the presence of men in drag during the annual Mummer's Parade on New Year's Day. The pre-Civil Rights era, when segregation was the status quo, saw the proliferation of African American house parties in neighborhoods such as North Philadelphia, where black gays and lesbians formed a community. During the 1950s and 1960s, Rittenhouse Square was the site of infomed public gatherings. These gatherings of friends and strangers helped set the stage for the Annual Reminder, the first public protest in support of \"homosexual equal rights,\" which took place every Fourth of July at Independence Hall. Throughout all of these eras, members of the community faced challenges, celebrated victories, and continued to try to blend their lives with those of their gay and straight neighbors.Thom Nickels is a poet and the author of several books, including Two Novellas: Walking Water & After All This, which was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award and a Hugo Award. The lifelong Phildelphia resident is a contributor to many newspapers, including the Philadelphia Daily News. He writes for the Lambda Book Report and is a columnist for Pridevision T.V. in Toronto.", "related": [], "rank": 1363666, "title": "Gay and Lesbian Philadelphia (Images of America) eBook", "author": "Thom Nickels", "category": "Gay & Lesbian", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wade (1973), involving privacy, women's rights, and fetal rights. Fifteen years later, two authors approach the case differently, though both believe individual women must have the right to control their bodies. Faux ( Childless by Choice ) offers a detailed description of the legal maneuvers surrounding the landmark case. She reveals the legal and social factors that led to the momentous decision to test the constitutionality of the Texas abortion law, focusing on two women attorneys who developed the case. Their struggle to retain control of it provides an unusual view of politics among lawyers. Faux's analysis of the case prior to the Supreme Court decision is useful, offering important additional information for lay readers and specialists. Law professor Goldstein offers a speculative essay to uncover the central dimensions of abortion law. Providing an excellent analysis of conflicting viewpoints, he shows that existing views cannot resolve questions about privacy or right to life. Using psychoanalytic-dyadic theory, he gives a revisionist legal view of the relationship between woman and fetus, proposing a new definition of their relationship based on the rights and duties of each party. He equates a woman's love of a fetus to an element of freedom.

After a very long divorce she again finds herself climbing that rocky path of life and has learned to live by a single quote: \"Obstacles are placed in our path to determine whether we really wanted something, or just thought we did.\" By Dr. Harold Smith. Suzie looks forward to each new obstacle. Taking life by the proverbial horns, Suzie now lives happily ever after with her new beau, three boys and one little Shih tzu named Peppy Le'Pew in NC. One day she plans to retire and sail along the east coast an adventurer to the end.", "related": ["B00BTKVIVK"], "rank": 1791389, "title": "The Devil's Defiance (The Devil Ryder Book 2)", "author": "Suzie Grant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not so: Flash springs straight from the loins of the X-rated cassettes video-rental stores hide on their back shelves. The heroine, aspiring movie star Maya Endicott, is so expert at casting-couch sex that she wins the female lead in The Starlet, a role Maya must play in the nude, handcuffed to a bed. Intrepid Maya rises to the occasion (as do most of the men on the set). But there is more to Maya than sexploitation film cutie. Abused by her mother as a child, later dumped by Jean-Paul, her wealthy French boyfriend, and supposing herself in love with the kinky, unattainable producer Sacha Sachtel, Maya exacts vengeance against the world by exposing herself to unsuspecting cabbies and deliverymen. Reconciliation with Jean-Paul and a move to Paris do not change Maya's ways, only the nationality of the men who glimpse her favors. Ultimately, hard living takes a toll, and she is hospitalized. A temperate, feminist Maya, who generally keeps her pants on, emerges. There are both funny and sad moments in Maya's story, but the bombardment of very graphic sex all but obliterates them.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B008Z9AVE8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The title of this book can be misleading. There is no story entitled “Psychology.” Rather, the place of psychological practice in modern society is the subject of all six of these impressively varied novellas. Readers will enjoy the author’s versatility, quirky (sometimes uproarious) sense of humor, sardonic view of the world, and fruitful imagination. He is also master of the ambiguous clue and unreliable narrator. In the hilarious “Paddling an Iceberg,” a woman having an existential crisis attends, with questionable success, a one-week seminar designed by a philosophy professor turned self-help guru. “The Blood-Brain Barrier” features a clinical psychologist whose first try as an expert witness may be his last and whose marriage seems just as indefinite. “Eat the Rich and Shit the Poor” is a major character study introducing Mr. Custard, who gives a new luster to the term psychopath. Fiction lovers who dig short story collections with footnotes (Kenan’s Let the Dead Bury Their Dead, 1992, and Dunn’s Ibid, 2005, come to mind) will enjoy Boyko’s equally fascinating “Notes on Sources.” Libraries with any short-fiction readers should buy this book and keep an eye out for the next one. --Ellen Loughran", "related": [], "rank": 3501751, "title": "Psychology and Other Stories", "author": "C.

This knowledge of small business made Kevin an unusually young talent in the field. By the age of 18, Kevin already owned his own court-reporting business and was a notary public in Maryland, DC and Virginia.  As a college student, at only 20 years-old, Kevin started a successful advertising business which held contracts with both Kentucky Fried Chicken and the Marines.  At 22, Kevin left to become a stock broker.  It wasn't long before he was a top producer with Shearson Lehman Hutton (which would later become Smith Barney).  From that point forward, Kevin's star in the business world just got brighter.  He would go on to carve out a twenty year career of acquiring and selling companies that stands as a monument to his ability to fix businesses.  In the wake of 9/11, having personally lost much to the attacks, it was decided that Kevin and his family would take an extended sailing trip, which they did for almost three years.  But even at sea, Kevin couldn’t stop his mind from returning to his passion of business.  Near the end of 2002 he had discovered a company called Solomon Technology.  Kevin agreed to help the company raise capital and and to take it public.  From the comfort of his boat, Kevin managed to raise the company several million dollars. After three years, Kevin reentered the business world rejuvenated.  In his time at sea, Kevin fell in love with the city of Charleston.  It was there that he founded Sequence Investment Partners.  It wasn't long before the company entered into an agreement with Webster Rodgers, becoming WRSequence.  After selling his equity share in the company, Kevin now lives a much quieter life managing his investments and working as a hightly-sought-after consultant. But his new life has left him salivating at the chance to fix one more business - the ultimate business.  After a lifetime developing a savant-like skill in his craft, Kevin is ready for the challenge this financial giant presents.  That one final business is, of course, the United States government. Which is why, ever since 2010, Kevin J. High has been writing this book. When not running a business or contemplating politics, Kevin is an avid sailor and photographer.  He has a son and daughter who both make him very proud.", "related": [], "rank": 4026284, "title": "King: Times like these require a King", "author": "Kevin High", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Marshaling critics from Hegel to bell hooks, and calling on a family history of resistance, Harris challenges his instructor and classmates, and in turn inspires his readers to redress the long history of American racism and white supremacy bound up with the epithet.''--Mark Sanders, Professor of English, Emory University''Harris combines the passion and power of personal experience with a masterful display of historical and literary criticism, and the finished product is a book that goes beyond Twain's painfully derogatory stereotypes, racial epithets, and the persistent myths to expose race as the enduring and central dilemma of the American experience. In compelling terms, Harris helps us understand why our claims of 'a post-racial society' remain open to serious question and debate.''--Lewis V. Baldwin, Professor of Religious Studies, Vanderbilt University\"The Forbidden Word is an elegant, heartfelt rumination on America's crucible of race. Engaging, beautifully crafted, and analytically powerful, it masterfully employs Twain's Huck Finn as both a literal and figurative representation of the nation's never-ending racial drama. By blending the narrative voice of a memoirist and the sharp insights of a true scholar, Harris achieves a remarkable literary triumph.''--Tim Wise, author of ''White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son'' --Wipf and Stock Publishers", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drawing on a vast array of sources in Arabic and European languages, he focuses on Sultan Mawlay Ismail's enslavement of 221,000 black Moroccans in the late seventeenth century in order to form a slave army. These soldiers and their families leveraged the essential role they played in the Sultan's government and gradually freed themselves, though many fell back into slavery after the demise of the Sultan's dynasty. By recounting the waxing and waning fortunes of these black Moroccans ... El Hamel elegantly demonstrates the heartbreaking ambiguity of racial slavery and servility.' Timothy Cleaveland, University of Georgia'This is an important topic, ignored until recently. The slavery question is cleverly, soundly, and gently analyzed. A fascinating historical study (including gender differentiation), which may help for the future.' Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, Professor Emerita, Université Paris Diderot'A powerfully written and provocative examination of slavery and the process of racialization in Morocco, bringing together North and West African scholarship in an imaginative and highly productive fashion. Sweeping in scope, impressively researched, and richly documented, El Hamel's achievement is at times mesmerizing; it constitutes a signal contribution to the study of slavery, race, and Islam. There is nothing quite like it.' Michael Gomez, New York University'Black Morocco is an elegant, beautifully written, and thoroughly researched lesson for all scholars of the history of Africa, the Middle East, and slavery. El Hamel's work teaches us to look within, and also beyond, Islam, for answers to the experience and the conditions of slavery in Morocco. [He] teaches us to listen to the legacy of Moroccan slavery in Gnawa music, giving his readers the chance to hear the experience of slavery, and to honor its singers.'

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": ["B007JCNNGK"], "rank": 3156779, "title": "Resolutions For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions) eBook", "author": "D.C.

His first book, Morning's at Seven, was published to wide acclaim. With an intuitive eye for the quirkiness of family life, his novels are full of wry comments and perceptive observations. This exquisite sense of detail has led to the filming of three of his books. His most engaging character is Gaylord Pentecost - a charming seven-year-old who observes the strange adult world with utter incredulity. Eric Malpass also wrote biographical novels, carefully researched and highly evocative of the period. Among these is Of Human Frailty, the moving story of Thomas Cramner. With his amusing and lovingly drawn details of life in rural England, Malpass' books typify a certain whimsical Englishness - a fact which undoubtedly contributes to his popularity in Europe. Married with a family, Eric Malpass lived in Long Eaton, near Nottingham, until his death in 1996.", "related": [], "rank": 1552055, "title": "At The Height Of The Moon (Pentecost Family)", "author": "Eric Malpass", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her writing comes from an intense desire to know and understand the unseen world of action and reaction combined with a sincere desire to share this understanding with other knowledge seekers.  Her first book, The Lightworker's Guide to Healing Grief  [2009] is a treatise on how to help yourself or someone else to heal grief.  Her second book, The Lightworker's Guide to Everyday Karma [2011] is a lighthearted look at applying the principles of karmic law to everyday life.  The Ghost Stories from the Ghosts’ Point of View series [2012] offers the reader an astonishing look at just exactly what it’s like to be dead. This series also shares the concepts of assisting ghosts to crossover into the Heaven World. Her lifelong studies into the deeper meaning of events and actions were further enhanced by the experiences of a dynamic 20-year career in the Navy working for the U.S. Submarine Force, retiring at the Commander level. Commander Erwin found the Navy to be a tremendous schoolhouse in which to study all the facets of behavior, from the worst, to the finest levels of humanity. Erwin currently writes a weekly blog on the philosophy of life, called Light Times. An extensive collection of her videos can be found on both her website and on her YouTube channel TinaErwin17. Tina lives in San Diego, CA. She has been happily married to the love of her life, submariner, CDR Troy Erwin, USN (Ret), for almost 40 years.

Complicated but honorable heroes; heroines who are strong, smart, and feminine; magic, romance, and adventure; and excursions into the dark corners of life and human nature mixed with a dash of offbeat humor - all of these make up Kyra Halland's worlds. She is excited to share those worlds with readers, who she hopes will enjoy her stories and characters as much as she does. Kyra Halland lives in southern Arizona. She has a very patient husband, two less-patient cats, and two young adult sons.

The idea for the opening scene in the first chapter, when Rick's spirit appears to Ramara, was based on an actual event that happened to a dear friend of mine whose teenaged son was killed in a motorcycle accident -- he appeared lifelike in her bedroom one morning. When she rushed toward him his spirit form vanished through a nearby window. She told me that his apparition was so real she thought for a moment that his death had been just a terrible dream. More often than not, truth is stranger than fiction. The character of Mae Gray Wolf was patterned after an amazing psychic I once visited for a spiritual reading in the town of Cassadaga, Florida, which is actually a Spiritualist Camp. I was totally unprepared for the \"separation anxiety\" I suffered when I finished writingWhen One Door Closes. I had been living vicariously in the world of Ramara McDougal for the years it took me to tell her story and, suddenly, I had no place to go.  So I had to start writing another book immediately to fill the void.  I hope you enjoy the story.", "related": [], "rank": 4258203, "title": "WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES", "author": "Alberta Mason", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His lips lingered on the edge of his glass, and Savannah wished to feel them close around her clit. She swallowed, hard, amazed at how forcefully she wanted this man she'd never met before. \"I don't usually do things like this,\" Savannah said, setting her glass on a side table and loosening the belt of her coat. \"Bullshit,\" Marshall smiled. Placing his glass beside her's, he knocked Savannah's hands away from her belt and scooped her up into his arms, surprising her. \"You're practically pocket-sized aren't you?\" This close, Savannah could feel the heat of Marshall's body. Though she'd only had a few sips of her drink, she felt absolutely drunk off of their sheer proximity. \"Where're we going?\" she asked dizzily. \"I'm going to interview you, remember?\" he said, \"I hope you won't be offended if some of the questions get a little personal. Savannah shook her head, stunned. Marshall carried her through the apartment, into what she presumed was the bedroom. There was a king-sized canopy bed at the center of the room, which was furnished lusciously.

He stood up, taking in the view of her lying prone before him, waiting. \"First question,\" he said, \"Do you mind being tied up?\" Savannah felt herself become wet at the idea of it. She shook her head. Marshall tucked under the bed and produced a length of rope. He leaned over Savannah and tied her arms masterfully, and as he pressed against her she could feel his dick hard against her thigh. When her arms were tied over her head, Marshall ran his hands along the sides of her body. He drank in the sight of her, groaning softly as he wrapped his large hands around her tiny ribcage. Marshall looked Savannah in the eye, and she felt as though she could drown in his gaze. She hardly noticed as he moved his hand between her legs. He ran his fingers along her inner thighs, and his eyes widened in delight as he realized that her panties we crotchless. Savannah smiled up at him and kneaded him playfully with her foot, brushing against his erection for lack of free hands.

While not graphic or overly profane, their well-written stories are often harrowing to read, with frank accounts of abuse, neglect, sexuality, and crushing loneliness. Vicious is the darkest of the three, focusing on the destructive results of cruelty. In contrast, what is most striking about Rage and Pressure is the teens' resilience as they seek aid, learn coping strategies, or find outlets for self-expression. Introductions and concluding sections provide general information and resources. Teens will identify with the writers, discover that their own problems are not unique, and be encouraged to find help, making these titles, particularly Rage and Pressure, solid choices. α(c) Copyright 2011.

Three of the stories dictated by the elves have been finished; five more are in the works.Dorothea is also working on another historical novel for young readers. It is set in 1825 in the small town in New Hampshire where she has lived since 1991.In addition to writing, Dorothea is an experienced actress and singer. She performed with the Ex Machina Baroque Opera Company in Minneapolis, and also played most of the Gilbert and Sullivan battle-ax contralto and ingenue mezzo roles with companies in Philadelphia and Minneapolis.

He grew up, as people tend to do, formed a range of opinions about this, that and the other, and eventually went to Uppsala University to study physics. Unable to contemplate a real job, he left his homeland after finishing his PhD in 1991. Having roamed the world for a few years, he settled in the United Kingdom where he now works as a professor of Mathematics (not a real job!). He has always loved books, in all shapes and sizes, and probably reads a bit too much for his own good. Most of the stuff he writes can be found in science journals, and tends to be awfully technical (perhaps boring) on things like dead stars, black holes and waves of gravity. This has made him wonder what it would be like to write a \"real\" book. Maybe one day he will find out...Nils is convinced that he used to be able to fly when he was little. He has a very clear memory of what it feels like to float up in the air and do somersaults and stuff. Sadly, he now understands how gravity works and absolutely can't fly.", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": 2300678, "title": "Professor Kompressor goes environ-mental", "author": "Nils Andersson", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brett Miller is a high-school sophomore who knows exactly who he is: he is a football star; he is the boyfriend of the fantastically hot Jillia; he is popular. He is normal and 100 percent not gay. Then he meets Zach in art class. Brett’s attraction is undeniable, and suddenly he doesn’t know who he is anymore. The first-person point of view enables the reader to empathize with Brett’s confusion as he struggles to come to terms with his bisexuality, which—in his most honest moments—Brett acknowledges he has tried to deny for some time. Brett’s relationship with classmate Nate, whose unwillingness to hide his homosexuality makes him the target of bullying (often at Brett’s hands), is simultaneously antagonistic and helpful. Despite the pitfalls that Brett’s struggle lands him in, he takes steps to get the support he needs from his family, and the reader comes away with the impression that, in time, Brett will find his way.

Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

Even Clare's violent white husband is in the dark about her past, though he teases her about her tan and affectionately calls her \"Nig.\"  He laughingly explains: \"When we were first married, she was white as--as--well as white as a lily. But I declare she's getting darker and darker.\" As Larsen makes clear,Passingcan also mean dying, and Clare is in peril of losing her identity and her life.The tale is simple on the surface--a few adventures in Chicago and New York's high life, with lots of real people and race-mixing events described (explicated by Thadious M. Davis's helpful introduction and footnotes). But underneath, it seethes with rage, guilt, sex, and complex deceptions. Irene fears losing her black husband to Clare, who seems increasingly predatory. Or is this all in Irene's mind? And is everyone wearing a mask? Larsen's book is a scary hall of mirrors, a murder mystery that can't resolve itself. It sticks with you.--Tim Appelo", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv.", "related": ["B00D7BVTIQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is never too late to change, he stresses, pointing to his own decision to take on the word fag, never one of his favorites, and not only use it, but glorify it, in his new novel. And that he does, in all sorts of creative permutations: Fag-a-pendous, Fag-bulous, Fag-rentious, and even Super-Fag-alicious are sprinkled liberally throughout, reinforcing the message that the word is not to be feared but, rather, celebrated. Spicy homo lingo vies with double entendres like things that go dirty in the night, as often raunchy outrageousness challenges the convenient, conservative, ethical, and primitive in this original, if ultimately unfulfilling, Fabulous Fairy Tale.  The storys premise is ingeniously promising. Beulah Mae Osguard, a middle-aged woman in the small, ironically named town of Perfection, Iowa, sees a televised report about San Franciscos Gay Pride Festival and finds herself enthralled by the sheer joy the participants exude. Seeking to experience similar exuberance, she decides to change everything about her staid and unsatisfying life. She turns to Craigslist to find someone to guide her in a complete transformation, and her wayward ad, poorly placed in the Women Seeking Men section, is answered by the very same B MacGregor who serves as author and narrator of the story. It seems like the perfect setup for a humorous romp, but the tale that follows is surprisingly not funny. Assuming the all-too-obvious role of the fairy godmother, B sets about helping Beulah Mae, whom he renames Charity, find her inner splendor. As it happens, B soon discovers that he needs her every bit as much as she needs him. When real-life events intervene, Beulah Mae is forced to trade the constraints of her stultifying life in Pefection for a prison sentence at the local penitentiary, and B becomes her weekly visitor. His Sunday visits to the prison and the tales he tells Charity drive the books plot. The weekly stories juxtapose memories of their time together with reinterpretations of well-known fairy tales. From Cinderellas own fairy godmother, a Fag hag if ever there was one, to Peter Pan, a juvenile Fag-in-the-making, to Pinocchio, whose growing nose offers the perfect opportunity for innuendo, each fairy-tale character is unceremoniously unmasked to reveal his own inner Fag.  Implausible circumstances, a high-strung personality, an abundance of gay pride, and even an overweight transvestite canine named Mr. Cuddle Bottom; contribute an unrestrained promise of hilarity, but laughter rarely follows. Bs stories always begin, Once upon a time, but he cannot guarantee a happily ever after, and A Fag for Her Fifties often feels overwhelmingly sad. With pearls of wisdom like, even though life is tough, the Fag in you has to be tougher, and throw out ALL the worthless memories in your life, B offers his best advice for living life in the present, but in the end, the much-sought-after happiness is bittersweet at best. --Cheryl Hibbard, Foreword ReviewsA Fag for Her Fifties is a book of stories, first and foremost, but they tie together into a cohesive novel that tells the whimsical story of an unlikely friendship between a woman in her 50s and a gay author of fairy tales. Beulah Mae Osguard (called Charity by her friends) is unlucky enough to be in prison, but she is lucky enough to have a caring and devoted best friend in B MacGregor (the authors name, most likely a pen name, is the same as the narrator's). B is a Fagtabulous gay man in his fifties who visits Charity religiously every week. As B recounts how they met through Charitys Craigslist ad seeking a gay man who can help her turn her life around he tells stories about their lives together to get her through the monotonous weeks. The overarching narrative thread of the novel is of Charitys imprisonment and her relationship with B, and each chapter is framed with a prison visit. It is an effective storytelling device; the author knows how to draw out a story well, balancing between pacing and suspense. As readers come to know and love these characters, they will be intrigued by how exactly B and Charity became such good friends, which will keep them hooked on the novel. The writing in A Fag for Her Fifties is confident and strong, much like the books main character, B. The prose style makes the book a pleasure to read, as the author introduces whimsy and delight into every sentence. And readers will appreciate the well-developed characters and unique premise, as well as the novels sense of joy. This is not a book that will necessarily appeal to men, but women who are in the mood for an escapist story with an out-and-proud main character will find A Fag for Her Fifties the perfect choice. --BlueInk ReviewLaughter through tears my favorite type of read. B MacGregor's debut novel is a sentimental roller coaster and a Fag-Tabulous ride. --Lori Lott, Publisher, AnyWho Editions", "related": [], "rank": 3591639, "title": "A Fag for Her Fifties", "author": "B MacGregor", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Diamond gave up a supervisor job in the banking industry to become a Vegas stripper to pay back family debts after the tragic death of her mother.

After retiring from stripping at age 45, she was inspired to write Stilettos in Vegas to change society's concept of what life is like as a stripper. Valerie has a heart for the wives who have husbands, the girl who has a boyfriend, and the child who has a mother. Many strippers are supporting children and husbands or boyfriends at home, making a living as a contributing part to society. Since there will always be a sex industry, Valerie believes that women should learn about strip clubs, which are free from sex and disease and carry the least emotional attachment, keeping their men away from the dark side. Dr. Don McGann, a retired dentist and educator, was moved by the struggles and dedication of Valerie and decided to help her document her experiences in this book, which is partially based on true events.

She retired from this work in 1950 but became so bored without the constant stimulus and irritation of teaching that she accepted a post at the Matthew Arnold School in Staines, where she taught English and history, wrote the annual school play, and coached hurdling. She was a member of the Detection Club, the PEN, the Middlesex Education Society, and the British Olympic Association. Her father’s family are Scots, and a Scottish influence has appeared in some of her books.", "related": ["B00IEJHSP4"], "rank": 276672, "title": "Wraiths and Changelings (Mrs. Bradley)", "author": "Gladys Mitchell", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I thought about what it would have been like for my wife and kids had I lost a battle like Bob's. During those days of reflection, I also watched as Bob's family, friends and neighbors unhesitatingly stepped up to help. I particularly noticed several men who took an active role in helping Jack- not directly helping him cope with the loss of his father, but just spending time with him and doing things that would bring some sense of normalcy to his life. But those types of things were outside of my comfort zone. I wondered what I could do to help the family- and then it came to me in the middle of the night- I would write a book that Jack's mother could share with him to help him see that although his father was gone, there were other wonderful men in his life who would not only help him remember his Dad, but also teach him things his Dad would have done.\"", "related": [], "rank": 3125540, "title": "Jack's Five Dads", "author": "Rob Hovey", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There's non-stop action and adventure, and I can honestly say I was excited and smiling while I was reading this book - it's that good. Jonah Havensby goes high up on my list of favorite books for this year, and I'm very much looking forward to the next book in this series.5 starsReviewed By Kathryn Bennett for Readers' Favorite.comThe idea of a Martian being raised among us is a great idea. I know it is not a completely new twist on things but I feel that Bob Bannon does breathe fresh life into this genre. I love the way this story unfolds and how it is written. The narrative is compelling and you truly feel as if you are going along with Jonah as he finds out things about himself. Once you pick this one up it is not likely you are going to be able to put it back down again easily. I read it from cover to cover in very little time and I would highly recommend it as a read.4 starsReviewed By Lex Allen for Readers' Favorite.comThe author guides the story through to the discovery of Jonah's true identity, and it's here where Mr. Bannon's wide ranging imagination comes to the fore. Every good story needs more than a single character and there are plenty here, too. Jonah's closest friends, Emma and Eric M, are the other primary protagonists guaranteed to tickle most readers' fancy. Personally, I would like to have seen less narrative detail that, in some cases, was extremely long.I'd also prefer more conflict.Regardless of these, I would recommend Jonah Havensby to all fans of YA paranormal, science fiction.", "related": [], "rank": 2644171, "title": "Jonah Havensby eBook", "author": "Bob Bannon", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is currently Vice-President of Sales and Marketing for Blue Lake Citrus Products, Inc., the company that produces and markets the Noble brand of high end specialty citrus juices as well as bulk citrus juices sold to other brands and retail chains. From 2007 until 2012, Allen was on the faculty of the University of Florida, stationed at the Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, FL. His responsibilities included both educational programs and research. Prior to that, he held managerial positions with various companies including Cutrale Citrus Juices USA, the North American subsidiary of Sucocitrico Cutrale, one of the world’s largest citrus growers, processors and exporters,  based in Araraquara, Brazil; Tropicana, one of the largest citrus juice brands, and the Coca-Cola Company.  He has also done consulting for many citrus growers, processors, and branded citrus juice firms.  Allen has published over 40 articles on citrus in trade and professional journals and has given numerous presentations about citrus world-wide. He wrote this novel because he wants to explain the intricacies of the birth and growth of the orange juice industry to the public, while making it an interesting story.  And, he wants to give readers an opportunity to experience the old Florida, the way it was before all of the theme parks and condos.  Allen currently resides with his wife Kate in Winter Haven, FL, and can be contacted at AllenMors@aol.com.
