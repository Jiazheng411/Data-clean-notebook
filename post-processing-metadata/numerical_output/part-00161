Formerly athletic and smart, she suddenly finds herself unable to concentrate or communicate with anyone. She is broken in both body and spirit and desperate to escape into the blue, which is how she remembers the drug-induced haze immediately after the accident. Not wanting anything to do with her father and his new family in California, she moves to New Hampshire to live with her aunt and uncle, and begins looking for ways to escape. She steals OxyContin from her uncle's medicine cabinet and becomes friends with Trina, who is dealing with her own substance-abuse problems. It takes two near-disasters for Jenna to tentatively open up to her classmate Crow and face her fears and grief. Oates is at her best telling the stories of teenage girls dealing with internal trauma and outside pressures. Jenna's pain at losing the only person truly close to her and the isolation she creates for herself are poignantly drawn. Her understanding that her choices are not what her mother would want for her is especially telling and may speak to teens in comparable situations. Similar in topic to E. R. Frank'sWrecked(S & S, 2005), this powerful novel is well worth reading.–Stephanie L.

Midway through sophomore year at Hamilton College, an inner voice said, \"Get out!\" It seemed crazy, but I knew it was the right thing to do. A fraternity brother told me I'd have no trouble finding work on the shrimp boats in Key West. I hitchhiked south. In Key West, I walked to the harbor and asked for a job on the first boat I found that had anyone on board. The captain said, \"Shrimp season's over, kid.\" I think he felt sorry for me. He pointed to a rusty shrimper across the water. \"He might take you.\" I picked up my bag and ran around to the other jetty, arriving just as the boat began to pull away. A man on deck was doing something with a cable. He wore a sweatshirt and had a two-day growth. \"I'm looking for work,\" I shouted over the engine.  \"You a winch man?\" The winch occupied a large part of the deck, a complicated assembly of giant gears and levers. The strip of water below my feet widened. It was jump or forget it. I had a vision of winching the boat upside down in the Gulf. I shook my head and walked to the Southern Cross Hotel, a wooden building with white peeling paint and a sign declaring, The Southernmost Hotel in the United States. I wrote it down in a notebook and have been writing ever since. Along the way I served in the Air Force, earned a degree in computer science from the University of Hawaii, married twice, and raised children. The adventures, the loves and betrayals, the teachers, the lessons---they are in my stories and poems, where, like all writers, I have tried to make of my deeper bio something worthwhile.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's stupid!\"\"What's stupid about it?\"\"It just is.\"\"What kind of name is Indigo?\"\"A perfect name, for a perfect girl.\" I rolled my eyes at him, placed my hands on my hips and was about to give him a piece of my mind. But I decided not to. \"How did you know my name anyway?\"He was silent for a moment, standing there with waves all in his hair, as if he slept in a doo-rag or something. His teeth were perfect, and I knew without asking that he used to wear braces. I wished my parents would spring for some braces for me, so that I could have perfect teeth like that. But instead, they were always complaining about having to pay bills and telling me that my teeth weren't that bad.\"Money don't grow on trees, Indi,\" Daddy was always telling me. \"But you got it better than most kids. We provide a nice home for you, you eat good, and you have your own room. That's more than I had when I was your age. I had to share a room with your uncle Keith when I was coming up. Never had my own room.\" Then he'd go into his spiel about having to walk ten miles to school in a Chicago blizzard. Imagine that. Ten miles in a Chicago blizzard? He'd lose me at that point.\"Daddy, come on,\" I would laugh. \"Ten miles is a lot of miles.\"\"Don't forget the part about the Chicago blizzard, girl'd have to laugh himself, because he knew that he was only telling half the truth.Sometimes I loved listening to my daddy's stories about growing up in Chicago at my nana Summer's house. It was an old house, two stories tall, with an old porch and shutters that needed to be painted, but the house always smelled so good. Like fried chicken, or my all-time favorite, macaroni and cheese as only Nana could make. But she was older now, and not quite the Nana I remembered when I was little. She couldn't remember anything anymore, and was always having aches and pains somewhere on her body.I missed the Nana that would come for visits in the summertime, creep into my room at night with chocolate chip cookies and sit in the wooden rocker next to my bedroom window. I could see my grandmother's caramel face in the moonlight, as she rocked back and forth with her eyes just barely closed.\"Don't get crumbs in the bed, either, little girl,\" she'd say.\"I won't, Nana.\" I'd promise, but still have to brush the crumbs from the sheets.Nana and I would talk about everything we could possibly think of. I could talk to her about any and everything. Whenever something was bothering me, she always knew. Even if I tried to smile and pretend everything was okay, Nana knew. And she'd always make me laugh even when I didn't feel like it.Nana insisted that I teach her all the latest dances. I taught her how to do the Harlem Shake and had to admit, she had rhythm. Before long, she could do the Harlem Shake better than some of the girls I knew from school.Nana would come to our house in June and stay the whole summer. I wished she could've stayed the entire year, but she always went back to Chicago at the end of August.\"I gotta go check on my house, baby,\" she would say whenever I would ask her to stay forever. \"But I'll be back for Christmas. And we'll decorate that old tree together, make hot apple cider and stay up all night on Christmas eve.\"\"Can I open at least one gift on Christmas Eve?\"\"You always do, and end up picking the biggest package under the tree,\" she'd chuckle. \"When will you learn that the best things don't always come in the big packages? Good things come in small packages, too.\"She was right, too, because I remembered last year when I got that sapphire necklace with the matching ankle bracelet. It was my favorite gift under the tree, and it came in the smallest package. And in the big box was a bunch of bras, panties and socks\"things I didn't care about.I always cried for a week after Nana was gone. I'd tell her about all the ugly, stupid boys in my class and tell her how much I hated them.\"You just wait until they grow up,\" Nana would laugh and say. \"You'll like boys one of these days, trust me.\"\"I don't think so, Nana.\" I couldn't even imagine looking at a boy for more than ten seconds without being ready to puke. And to like them? Now that was taking it a bit too far. \"Why are boys so stupid?\"\"I don't know, baby.\" I could see Nana's smile in the moonlight; her calmness is what I admired most about her. \"They just are. And they don't get much better with age, either. In fact, some of them get worse. You'll see when you get married.\"\"I'm never getting married, Nana.\" I wanted to make that crystal clear!\"Never?\" Nana would ask with a look of surprise.\"Never!\" My mind was made up. She'd see. And I swore I'd never have kids either. Because if all little kids worked my nerves like my little cousin, Keith Jr. did, then I was never becoming anybody's mama. Good thing I only had to see him on holidays. Since my uncle Keith and his wife were divorced, he only had Keith Jr. every other weekend and on Thanksgiving, during spring break and on the Fourth of July.It seemed that everybody was getting a divorce, and I hoped that it would never happen to my parents. It happened to my best friend Jade's parents. Just when she thought they were this big happy family, boom, that's when it happened. And it seemed to happen overnight. Her folks had a big argument one night and the next thing Jade knew, her daddy was loading his stuff into the back of a U-Haul. I watched the whole thing from my bedroom window. They lived next door since Jade and I were in the third grade. We had been best friends just that long.I still remember when they moved in, and Mama made me go over and introduce myself to the little girl next door. She had baked them a lemon cake and said for me to take it over there. Jade was on her front porch playing with her Barbies, and when she let me see her Barbie doll\"and I told her I had four of them at home\"it was on. From that day forward we were inseparable.In fifth grade we had our own Kool-Aid stand, selling beverages to the neighbors as they passed by our little makeshift stand. In seventh grade we both tried out for cheerleading, and neither one of us made the team because we couldn't do the splits. In the eighth grade we played volleyball together, but decided it wasn't our game. We both knew that when we got to high school we'd try out for the dance team. That was our sole purpose for wanting to attend George Washington Carver High, to join their dance team, which was known throughout the city for their outstanding performances. They often performed during parades and stuff, and the whole town recognized their talent. Articles were written about them in the newspaper. To make that team meant you were one of the most talented dancers in all of Atlanta.It's all we talked about the summer after eighth grade. We spent hours learning all the latest dances and brushing up on our moves. We were determined to make that dance team if it was the last thing we did in this lifetime! But then her folks split up. I never knew that when I watched her daddy load his things into that U-Haul, it was the beginning of the end.\"What your mama cook for dinner?\" I remember asking her that day.\"Nothing. She's mad at my daddy.\"\"What did he do?\"\"He came home late again last night,\" she said, almost in a whisper. \"Real late.\"\"Where do you think he was?\"\"I don't know, but she was really mad. They had a bad argument, too,\" she said. \"I don't think they love each other anymore.\"\"For real?\" I asked, lying across my canopy bed and talking to Jade on my cell phone, as she sat on her bed in her room just a spit's distance away.If I stood in my bedroom window, I could see Jade's pink-and-white comforter on her bed, her bookshelf and the Usher poster she had plastered on her wall. I knew when she brushed her teeth and said her prayers at night, and I knew when she awakened in the morning, because the light from her room would creep across my face and wake me up, too. I would often throw Skittles at her window in order to wake her up when she tried to sleep in on Saturday mornings.\"Yes, for real,\" she said, almost in tears after her parents' big fight. \"She told him to move out.\"\"Do you think she was serious?\"\"He's packing his stuff right now, as we speak,\" she said.My heart skipped a beat when she said that. That night, I closed my eyes real tight, knelt beside my bed and prayed that God would not only keep Jade's parents together, but mine, too. I didn't ever want my daddy packing his things and moving away.I guess he missed the part about Jade's parents, because the next day her father was gone.Mama had sent me to the new neighbor's with a pound cake.

He was late and splattered with thick gray mud. Hopefully someone would have sorted the mail by now, and he could quietly pick up his few bills and get back to the ranch and shower. If he had been paying more attention to the road, he wouldn't have slipped into the ditch and ended up with the wheels of his pickup stuck in the mud.Reno shook his head. He'd made it a point to thank God repeatedly for the rain—what rancher wouldn't?—but he was working on being honest in his dealings with God, and so far he hadn't been able to say anything polite about the mud. The mud just lay everywhere, making the ground look forlorn and generally being a nuisance.Reno had liked the first part of spring well enough. The cold of winter had eased up a little and he could walk from the house to the barn without pulling his cap down over his ears. But later, for some reason, everything had turned to mud. The mountains were no longer covered in snow, but the grass hadn't taken hold yet either. Gray clouds hung in most of the skies, and the air was wet even when it wasn't raining. The worst part was the deep clay that trapped everyone's wheels.Reno frowned as he opened the door to his pickup. The one good thing he could say for the mud was that it matched his mood these days. If it had been a normal Montana spring with endless blue sky and those tiny purple wildflowers blooming beside the gravel roads, he wouldn't have been able to take all the love and sunshine flowing around the Redfern Ranch now that his sister, Nicki, had settled into married life.At first Reno had wondered in alarm if he were jealous of Nicki's wedded bliss. But that wasn't it. He just missed the way things used to be.There was such a thing as too much happiness, Reno finally decided, and his sister proved it. Nicki was so sweet these days it made his teeth ache. If she weren't so sweet, he probably wouldn't miss the old Nicki so much.But as much as he tried to bring Nicki back to her senses, he couldn't. He couldn't even get her going on a good argument about cattle prices and fertilizer, and those used to be her favorite topics for heated discussion. But now all she wanted to talk about was curtain fabric and love. She had a perfectly good rancher's brain that was turning to sentimental mush, and he was powerless to stop it.And she wasn't content to limit her new sentimental thoughts of love to herself and her new husband. Oh, no—she had started to speak of marriage with a missionary zeal that made Reno nervous. He had seen the speculation in her eyes several days before she came right out and asked him if he'd like her to set him up.Set him up! Reno still couldn't believe it. He and Nicki had had a pact. Neither one of them was going to get married, at least not for love. Of course, they'd made that vow when they were ten and twelve, a good four years after their mother had left their father and they'd heard every day since about the damage love could do from their father's own bitter lips.Besides, even if Reno decided to take leave of his senses and look for a wife, he didn't need his sister doing the looking for him. There were plenty of women who wanted to date him. Granted, he wasn't exactly in touch with any of them at the moment, but that was only because he was busy feeding the new calves and, well—things.\"I'm getting around to it.\" Reno had set his glass of water down on the kitchen counter when Nicki asked her question. \"You don't need to worry about me. I'm doing fine.\"\"Really, you've met someone you want to date?\"Reno scowled. She didn't need to sound so surprised. \"Well, no, but I will—\"\"When you have time,\" Nicki finished for him, and shook her head. \"I know as well as you do that there's never any extra time when you're ranching— you have to make time for what's important.\"\"Getting the alfalfa planted is important.\"\"With mud like this, you can't even plow. That's why Garrett and I decided to go to Denver. There's nothing to do right now.\"\"I can change the plugs on the tractor.\"\"Or you could do something fun for a change, like maybe go down to Los Angeles and pay a visit to Chrissy Hamilton.\"Reno was struck dumb. Chrissy was the cousin of Nicki's new husband, Garrett Hamilton. \"Why would I do that?\"\"Because you've been, well, morose since Chrissy visited here last fall. That's not like you.\"Morose?Ever since Nicki had married her trucker husband, she'd started learning a new word every day. Reno didn't like to discourage anyone who wanted to learn. Still… \"That's not because of Chrissy.\"Well, Reno admitted to himself, it might be a little bit because of Chrissy, but it wasn't in the way his sister thought.Chrissy had come to Dry Creek last fall looking for Reno and Nicki's mother. Before Chrissy moved back to Los Angeles, she had been a waitress in the Las Vegas casino where their mother worked. The two had become friends, and Reno could understand why.If Chrissy was upsetting to him, it was only because she reminded him of his mother. Both women had that high-wattage, bright-color sway that went with a place like Las Vegas. They wore fancy sequin dresses with the same ease that women in Dry Creek wore their aprons.It was clear that neither his mother nor Chrissy belonged in Dry Creek, and that's why Chrissy had bothered him. Really the only reason she still bothered him, he told himself.Nicki looked at him as if she didn't believe him. \"You're not still afraid to get married, are you?\"\"Huh?\"Nicki had the grace to blush. \"I know we both said we would never get married, but we were kids. What did we know?\"\"We knew what Dad told us.\"\"Ah, well, he only saw one side of being married. If he'd known there were people out there like Garrett, who can really love someone, he wouldn't have wanted us to stay single all our lives.\"Reno decided he shouldn't argue with his sister on this one. \"I suppose he might have been okay withyoumarrying.\"Nicki looked relieved. \"And you, too.\"Reno doubted all of it. He had known his father. But he held his tongue.\"Anyway, here's Chrissy's address and phone number,\" Nicki said as she pulled a piece of paper out of her jeans pocket and set it on the kitchen counter. \"You could at least call and talk to her—or write her a letter or something.\"With that, Nicki turned and walked away.She might as well have left a stick of live dynamite on the kitchen counter.Reno just stared at the paper.He didn't tell his sister that he didn't need to call Chrissy or write her a letter to find out if the two of them were destined for some kind of wedded bliss. For even a little bit of bliss to happen, the woman would have to like him, and it appeared the very thought of dating him made Chrissy Hamilton want to cry.Even someone as lovestruck as his sister would have to agree that was not a good sign. Fortunately, no one knew about him and Chrissy.When Chrissy had been at the ranch last fall, he'd decided to invite her to eat dinner at the café in Dry Creek with him. He hadn't thought it was any big deal. He'd spent the afternoon convincing himself that just because her green-gray eyes made him want to take up painting storm clouds, that was no reason to think he was interested in anything but getting to know someone who could tell him more about his mother.He'd even stopped himself from wondering about Chrissy's lips once he decided they looked as soft as they did because of some sort of Las Vegas beauty trick.No, he'd put all that aside. Dinner was just a logical thing. Hamburgers and fries for two hungry people at the café in Dry Creek. Maybe spaghetti and garlic bread, if they had it. He'd started out by saying there was no reason to go to any trouble and change clothes and they both had to eat, so would she like to come with him to eat at the—That's as far as he'd got before she'd given him a stricken look and started to cry. He hadn't known what to do but take her in his arms and let her sob against his last clean shirt. After the first burst of tears had ended, she'd pulled back and looked embarrassed. Her cheeks had been pink, and her eyes had dared him to ask about her tears.Before he could say anything, she'd thanked him for the invitation in a businesslike voice and added she was sorry she couldn't date him. She was also sorry about the shirt, she said, and added that a little bleach should take the mascara out.By then he couldn't say he hadn't been asking her out on a date, so he'd just thanked her for the laundry tip. He hadn't added that he was surprised. He'd never figured someone like Chrissy would know anything about laundry.Fortunately, no one knew about any of this, and Reno wasn't about to tell anyone. He picked up the slip of paper from the kitchen counter, intending to crumple it up and throw it away. He should be glad Chrissy wasn't interested in him.Reno was cautious when it came to women. Even if he hadn't had his father to remind him of how fickle women could be, his mother had taught him that some women just weren't meant to live on a ranch.Life on the Redfern Ranch could never compete with the excitement of a big city. Ranch life was plain, good living, and that was all Reno wanted, but he knew there was no theater, no fine dining, no museums, no upscale shopping.A Vegas cocktail waitress like Chrissy would never stay in a place like Dry Creek any more than his mother had. Oh, Chrissy might think it was quaint and amusing enough for a week or so, but in the long term she'd leave. Dry Creek would never be enough for her.Yes, throwing away that piece of paper his sister had left on the counter was the only sensible thing to do. Reno said those words to himself, but for some strange reason he didn't listen. Instead, he folded the piece of paper into a small square and put it in his shirt pocket.He told himself he'd throw it away tomorrow. When tomorrow came, he told himself it wouldn't hurt to wait until the next day.That was two weeks ago Monday, and he no ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a dryly witty, formal tone, Espey ( Strong Drink, Strong Language ) describes life as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford during the 1930s. He delights in telling how his worldliness and literary knowledge (he had lived in Shanghai and studied English literature at Occidental College in California) surprised and annoyed his Oxford dons. ``I imagine you have read some Chaucer?'' a professor asks condescendingly. ``Yes, sir,'' Espey replies. ``At my American college I completed a course that covered the entire works in Robinson's edition.'' By contrast, See ( Rhine Maidens ), who studied at UCLA in the early '60s, is less proud when depicting her struggle to fit into a conservative institution run by a male hierarchy that frowned upon the hiring of women and open-mindedness. See parodies the double standard that permitted professors to carry on affairs while their wives were warned to remain invisible. Despite funny lines (``I sure wish I'd read Betty Friedan back when it counted, instead of `Mythomystes'!'' admits See), the book is weakened by its stiff style.Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Still, the fascination endures, perhaps because of the charismatic qualities of the chief participants: Custer, Sitting Bull, and Crazy Horse. Consequently, this brief introduction to events will have value for general readers. Professor Lehman follows a conventional narrative approach, beginning with the opening salvos between the U.S. Army and Lakota bands in the 1850s; he effectively provides context for the intensifying conflict with the Lakota and other bands of Plains Indians; and he strives to provide their perspective on the struggle. There are interesting vignettes on key personalities, and Lehman's chapters on the months and years following the battle are particularly well done. For interested but uninitiated readers who wish to learn about the topic, this fast-moving and well-written survey will be ideal. --Jay Freeman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I’ve been called ‘amateurish’ and ‘narcissistic’ (and other things, such as ‘prolific’ and ‘daring’), for being true to myself via the written word. To borrow a quote from Kurt Cobain—‘I’d rather be hated for what I am, than loved for what I’m not’.”   Jess would like to try out copywriting, and teaching ESL, some time in the near future. In August 2010, she published the first book (lust) in a YA “seven deadly sins” series, and is currently working on some outlines for two urban fantasy projects.

Mostly meteorological in scope, the book also addresses physical and socio-economic impacts in a style that combines short stories, science, hurricane histories, and anecdotes.  The geographic scope extends from Key West counter-clockwise to Isla Holbox, Mexico, but special emphasis is given to the Central Gulf Coast from Panama City to Galveston.  Hurricane Katrina (2005) is given extensive coverage in a stand-alone chapter.  By coincidence, the first page has a storm rolling into Galveston (1900), and the last page has storm waters receding from Galveston in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike (2008).  This book is a `must-read' for weather aficionados and all residents of the circum-Gulf of Mexico who have felt the tropical winds increase in strength.\"--Klaus J. Meyer-Arendt, University of West Florida\"Keim and Muller have skillfully produced a must read book for anyone intrigued by Gulf hurricanes.  Regional planners, local emergency managers and storm enthusiasts are among those who will find much of interest, as text, figures and photographs are used to explore hurricane dynamics, historic storms, societal impacts, and potential future storm tendencies.  The authors' climatological know how, geographical vision, and decades of personal experience make for a thorough and timely contribution.\"--David A.

This time, though, the author's fervid imagination?which here mixes the cryonic preservation of human life, the downloading of human personalities into a computer and a Fatal Attraction-style love affair?creates only a muddle. Neuroscientist Joe Messenger, of England's Isaac Newton University, has inherited his father's belief in, and passion for, cryonic preservation; he has also constructed a computer dubbed ARCHIVE, designed to eventually store the contents of an adult human brain. This goal seems far beyond reach until Joe meets the seductive Juliet Spring, who shows him how it can be done. But Juliet has an ulterior motive?she has six months to live, and wants her own personality digitized before she dies. When she does die, and ARCHIVE takes on her chillingly psychotic characteristics, the reader will be miles ahead of most of the characters in figuring out what's going on. The only real surprise involves the cryonics subplot, which is a needless complication, giving the impression that this novel consists of two books forced between the same covers. In addition, by pacing revelations slowly to accommodate his well-drawn but amazingly obtuse characters, James risks losing readers' interest. Despite an intriguing premise and some genuine scares, this is yet another novel in which less would have been more.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She didn't think she was special. Perhaps she wasn't. Maybe her life resembled those of other women who lived between 1820 and 1920. The fact is, history hasn't told us much about women. Thanks to writers like Joseph Gomez, we are beginning to learn the rest of our nation's history. Whether or not Sarah's life was typical, her story is extraordinary for late 20th century readers, and Gomez tells it in a way that is both engaging and educational. He weaves an intimate personal narrative into the fabric of American history. The reader grows close to Sarah through sensitively rendered anecdotes that define her relationships with others, like her grandfather, and show how particular incidents influenced her later life. At the same time, we see how she was touched by national events: wars, epidemics and the elections of presidents from William Henry Harrison (with whom she dined) to Abraham Lincoln. Sarah and her husband were abolitionists, but he returns from the Civil War a broken man. Sarah cares for him while raising nine children and, after his death, survives prairie fires, a grasshopper plague and prolonged poverty before she pays off her mortgage. If Sarah was not unusual, then Gomez's well- researched account of her life deepens our appreciation of the extraordinary experiences of ordinary people.

Fleming understands this, and\nin chronicling Frank Werner's adventures in Star Chamber Brotherhood,\nset in the same universe asForty Days at Kamas, he details the ways dictatorships\nfall. Werner, who survived the Kamas rebellion and was eventually given amnesty,\nis carving out a life in 2029 Boston until an old friend from Kamas appears.\nThe warden of the camp has taken a high-ranking federal job in Boston and Werner's\norders are to kill him.

The U.S.\nhas been taken over by the Unionist Party, a brutal totalitarian regime. InStar\nChamber Brotherhood, five years have passed. Kamas survivor Frank Werner\nhas found his way to Boston, where heis approached by a member\nof the Star Committee dedicated to dispensing justice to officials responsible\nfor the bloody Kamas suppression. Werner is ordered to kill the camp's former\ncommandant, builds a team and sees two attempts fail. WhileKamaswas a\nphilosophic book that raised questions about what can happen when freedom is\nlost, this time the point is the plot. The milieu is decidedly less harsh, but\nthe characters are just as vivid as in the first book.Star Chamberhas\na completely different tone--it's an engaging, fast-paced thriller where the\nreader will spend pleasant hours rooting for a team of assassins.\" BOOKPLEASURES.COM", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.6364, "rating_total": 51.0}

She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of The Monthly Packet, a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership). Among the best known of her works are The Heir of Redclyffe, Heartsease, and The Daisy Chain. A Book of Golden Deeds is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. She also wrote Cameos from English History, Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands and Hannah More. Her History of Christian Names was described as \"the first serious attempt at tackling the subject\" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names, 1944. Her personal example and influence on her god-daughter, Alice Mary Coleridge, played a formative role in Coleridge's zeal for women's education and thus, indirectly, led to the foundation of Abbots Bromley School for Girls. After her death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, Christabel Coleridge, published the biographical Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters (1903).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Reggie & Ryssa series developed when Bo discovered a passion in her children and others, for fantasy fiction suitable for kids, but didn't \"talk down\" to them. Reading has always been one of her great passions in life, and she wanted to encourage that in the next generation by giving them a tale that was uniquely theirs. There are 6 books currently planned for the Reggie & Ryssa series, and 5 books for the Broken Wings series, plus a spin off series that delves further into the realm of the Grigori. Bo writes under several pseudonyms, to keep the genres of her books separate and distinct in the hearts and minds of her readers. Her books for young adults are written under Bo Savino. Her spiritual books are written under Dr. Kim Savino. Her contemporary books (primarily fantasy) are written under A.J. Rand (after her 3 sons...Aaron, Joshua, & Random).

He then retired to work in industry for seven years before retiring for a second time.  At that point he and his wife bought a yacht and went to live in the Caribbean.  It was this experience that led to the idea for his first book ‘Jacaranda’.  There is so much history in the islands that remains forgotten.  The book and its sequel ‘The Guadeloupe Guillotine’ seek to illuminate a small corner of history that is largely ignored and at the same time provide a thrilling and exciting story for all who love the sea and sailing. Brought up on the books of C S Forester and Patrick O’Brien he was surprised that no one was writing similar stories about the modern Royal Navy, especially with so much going in in previous decades.  As he was himself a Lynx helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, he decided to start there, using his own extensive knowledge of the conflict.  ‘Sea Skimmer’ was the result; a book based on many true stories, the main one being why the Argentinian Exocet missiles failed to explode.  Directly involved in anti Exocet countermeasures and also with a grandstand seat of the final Exocet raid of the war, the book, although a novel, has an authenticity that cannot be bettered.  The next one in the series, ‘The Caspian Monster’ looks at Cold War Operations and the little known fact that 1983 was the year nuclear war almost broke out and no one realised it.  The latest book in the series is about anti-submarine and anti-drug smuggling operations in the West Indies, something else he has first hand experience of.  There are many more to follow. He now lives near Plymouth in Devon, where he works as a full time writer and extraordinarily bad golfer.", "related": ["B00H2B7EZY"], "rank": 2357902, "title": "Jacaranda (The Jacaranda trilogy Book 1)", "author": "Larry Jeram-Croft", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Revealed inside is the\nevidence of what seems to be a very secret NASA/D.O.E. experiment\nto alter Jupiter with insertions of fissionable-fissile material over the\npast couple decades. What had been advertised as harmless insertions\nof various plutonium pellets by the said institutions is actually shown to be a\nviable \"transformation mechanism\" made possible by the nearly-indestructible\nnature of the devices inserted.Readers will be stunned by the mountain of discoveries that back up the\nassertions that, as we speak, Jupiter is undergoing a massive change within,\ninitiated by \"The Philosopher's Stones\", or said devices. Even a\nrecent NASA article declares the \"mystery\" of Jupiter's current\n\"turmoil\"; the changes, the infrared heat, the peculiar\n\"impacts\". All of these anomalies are explained\nfrom a different but scientifically plausible perspective based on the\nintroduction of relatively large amounts of heavy plutonium into Jupiter.What the final result will be is not yet clear...will Jupiter become a tiny\nartificial star? \"Conventional wisdom\" says it's not possible, but it is not aware of a novel ingredient that now makes it viable:an incredibly hot heat spark artificially\nintroduced near the center!..something that Jupiter could NOT provide with\nits own pressure due to low mass, but which has now been stealthily provided to it.Some say the type of plutonium used won't work.  Author, J Edward Carper, provides evidence that the plutonium mix used is actually perfect for the job.This is a DEEP read for those with curiosity to discover the nature of one of the boldest experiments ever attempted by man!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This unique perspective on life is evident in this 30 story book.Strathmore was the beginning of an odyssey that lasted for the next thirty-two years. My career commenced on December 16, 1963 , at the Strathmore Fish and Wildlife office. For me, the prospect of any new job has always been exciting; this one proved to be a real dandy! I was one of the lucky applicants chosen from around 400 for only 10 vacant positions. Not that I stayed in Strathmore long. May of 1964 saw my wife and I move north to Barrhead, the move occurring between stints of in-service training at the Forestry Training School in Hinton. Barrhead lasted until 1966 when I was transferred to High Level. Up north we went- myself, my wife, and one infant daughter. High Level was home until 1970, then it was off to High Prairie for five years, this time with a second infant daughter in tow. By the time we were posted to Edmonton for a further five years, our now not-so-infant daughters were not so sure about all this moving. 1980 saw one further posting to Rocky Mountain House, this time one that would see me through till buyout and retirement in 1995.", "related": [], "rank": 3249728, "title": "ebook,Chuck Shipley,Poachers, Beans & Birch Bark,JBS Publishing,NATURE / Environmental Conservation & Protection,BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs\" />", "author": "Chuck Shipley", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She seems to have a quirky analogy for every occasion - and makes some really funny observations about people, life and her own routines.

Ranging over legal history (the 'archive'), moral theory, metaphor (sword, shield, balance and mirror) and maxims of office, Sheppard wisely counsels against a binary opposition between law and morality in assessing what our officials do.  There are complex relations between the two, beginning with the oath of office.  This brilliant book is essential reading for all those interested in public office.\"--H. Patrick Glenn, Peter M. Laing Professor of Law, McGill University\"By focusing his important new book, I Do Solemnly Swear:  The Moral Obligations of Legal Officials, on what he calls \"the retail ideas of justice,\" that is, the interplay of rules, behavior, and beliefs that shape the actions of individual judges, lawyers, and other legal officials, Professor Steven Sheppard helps restore a human face to the law and, in the process, brings new clarity to the legal system and its functioning.  Sheppard's thesis that \"officials must be moral. not just legal\" may ring strange to the many accustomed to the notion that the legal system long ago severed it links to morality, but the case is compelling, both descriptively and proscriptively, that no such separation is possible for a legal system whose aim is to act justly.  Without morality, \"there is no legal protection against tyranny, because laws may always be changed by laws,\" a point most recently illustrated by the Bush administration's legal memoranda purporting to justify the application of torture.I Do Solemnly Swear is a major contribution to a disputed and little understood area of legal scholarship.  It is a learned, witty, provocative, challenging, penetrating, and compelling work of legal history and philosophy, yet one with immediate and practical relevance to any public official seeking to honorably discharge the duties of his office.\"--Alberto Mora, General Counsel of the United States Navy, 2001-2006, Recipient in 2006 of the John F.

Her favorite genre is murder mystery but each book brings forth characters who rely on God as they solve the puzzle in their life. Her readers also have a tremendous amount of input when they wonder what happened to this character or that one, even if they are secondary to the story. Barbara’s devotionals are sought after each year when she publishes a new one that reflects what God has placed on her heart. From Straight Pipes, her first, to Chaps, the latest, Barbara’s devotions take people to the place where God can touch their heart and leave a lasting impression. 2012 will see the release of her fifth about the Sermon on the Mount. Born in Canada, Barbara lived in the US for 12 years. There her writing surfaced as she worked as a journalist for six years with over 2500 articles published in newspapers and magazines during that time. Her readership expanded while in the States but now the Canadian public has discovered the gift that God has given yet another Canadian. She is a member of The Word Guild, Manitoba Writer’s Guild, The Writer’s Collective, and Christian Motorcyclists Association where each summer her books are used to inspire and encourage. Barbara has spoken across the US and in Manitoba, Canada for women’s groups and in church services on topics such as The Writing Experience, working in the ministry of Christian Motorcyclists Association, Love, Parenting, Time Management, and a host of others. With 11 books to her credit, each one surpasses the last, according to her readers. They look forward to Silence, the fourth in the Wilton/Strait mystery series, and Road Trip, her fifth devotional about the Sermon on the Mount in 2012. Barbara will allow some new characters to tell their story in a new series Finders Keepers which she plans to begin in 2012.

Likewise the second volume, which appeared in 1926. The book details Hitler's childhood, the \"betrayal\" of Germany in World War I, the desire for revenge against France, the need for lebensraum for the German people, and the means by which the National Socialist party can gain power. It also includes Hitler's racist agenda and his glorification of the \"Aryan\" race. The few outside the Nazi party who read it dismissed it as nonsense, not believing that anyone could--or would--carry out its radical, terrorist programs. As Hitler and the Nazis gained power, first party members and then the general public were pressured to buy the book. By the time Hitler became chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, the book stood atop the German bestseller lists. Had the book been taken seriously when it was first published, perhaps the 20th century would have been very different.Beyond the anger, hatred, bigotry, and self-aggrandizing,Mein Kampfis saddled with tortured prose, meandering narrative, and tangled metaphors (one person was described as \"a thorn in the eyes of venal officials\"). That said, it is an incredibly important book. It is foolish to think that the Holocaust could not happen again, especially if World War II and its horrors are forgotten. As an Amazon.com reader has pointed out, \"If you want to learn about why the Holocaust happened, you can't avoid reading the words of the man who was most responsible for it happening.\"Mein Kampf, therefore, must be read as a reminder that evil can all too easily grow. --Sunny Delaney", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He mingled with them, gained their confidence showed a personal concern in their affairs, and stimulated them to honest and useful living. With his first story he won the hearts of all red-blooded boys everywhere, and of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies were sold during the author's lifetime.In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, bald-headed man, with cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused all who met him.

I wrote the\noriginal scene at the request of the publisher and it was the last thing I\nwrote for the book. The publisher wanted more detail on the family background\nof Zeb, the more carefree of my EleMental characters. But when the manuscript\nwas subsequently passed onto the editor for closer work, this entire scene of\n'showing' was replaced by a single paragraph of 'telling' - little more than a\nquick reference to how Zeb's father was working overspace. I'd over-cooked it.It was originally presented in EleMental as a flashback, located towards the\nend of the first third of the book, so in the first act, as far as story\nstructure goes. The story describes the moment before the significant departure\nof Zeb's father for some months, and the tensions that surfaced at such a\nstressful time. When I was a child, my own father often headed off overseas for\nmonths at a time. His departures were always charged with emotion, and those\nmemories informed this scene.I enjoyed writing the scene - now\na short story - and I hope you like it too.Steven O'Connor, June 2012", "related": ["B009BIHVB8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she's not writing or reading, she's out on her family boat at Lake Taupo, teaching her young boys to fish, showing them the beauty that surrounds them in nature and catching some delicious trout for dinner.

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Pink was born in England in 1886 and died in Scotland in 1952. He attended Moody Bible Institute for six weeks, grew impatient, and moved to Colorado where he began pastoring a church. He pastored churches in America and Australia then returned to Great Britain. After his death his writings became influential in the American Evangelical churches. He was influenced by Protestant, Calvinist, premillennial dispensational and evangelical thinking. We don't hear much of Pink in American Mainline Protestant churches, probably because he wasn't credentialed by a major institutional church and because of his lack of academic pedigree. Pink, along with Calvin, has recently become \"disendorsed\" by a fundamentalist group. He was and remains an \"outsider.\" His pastorates were short, lasting about two years. With his wife, Vera, he spent his later years in the Scottish Hebrides and there he enjoyed a ministry of writing. He published a newsletter with about 1,000 subscribers and enjoyed a wide correspondence. Life in the harbor town of Stornoway allowed Pink both the stimulation and the solitude to think--luxuries not readily available to parish pastors. There he enjoyed both continued learning and the freedom to change his views from time to time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Scott was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, but the family moved to Croydon before she was two years old. Janice attended the local Infants’ and Primary schools, winning a scholarship at the age of ten to Croydon High School. On leaving school she won a place at King’s College Hospital in Dulwich to study physiotherapy, and later trained at The Middlesex Hospital in London as a teacher of physiotherapy. During this time she met and married Ian, also a Chartered Physiotherapist and teacher of physiotherapy. The couple taught physiotherapy at The London Hospital for three years, during which their first two children—Fiona and Alexander—were born, before the family moved to Fakenham in Norfolk where Janice and Ian set up in private practice and their third child—Rebecca—was born.  In the late eighties Janice experienced a call to ordained ministry. She trained with the East Anglian Ministerial Training Course and was ordained priest  in 1994. In 1995 the family moved to Eaton in Norwich, where Janice became stipendiary curate.  In 1999 she became rector at Dickleburgh And The Pulhams, six rural parishes in South Norfolk. During this time Janice was appointed Rural Dean of Redenhall Deanery, Honorary Canon of Norwich Cathedral, and completed an MA in pastoral theology. Janice’s writing career started when she won a radio short story competition, followed by having a short story accepted for Angus Wilson’s ‘Writers Of East Anglia’. She was a regular contributor to ‘Pause For Thought’ on Radio Norfolk until the programme was axed, and is a staff writer for Redemptorist Publications. Her internationally renowned website, ‘Sermons And Stories’ was taken over by CSS Publishing Co., a Christian publishing company in the USA, where she writes as ‘The Village Shepherd’.  Aware of the gulf between church attenders and the non-church attending public, Janice decided to write a trilogy of novels featuring Rev. Polly Hewitt, a warm, human and fun-loving priest whose Christianity is practical and down-to-earth, but due to demand, the series continues! The fourth novel is due out in 2013 and is again a murder mystery. The novels all open up some of the deeper questions of life in a non-threatening and easy manner which can be enjoyed by those of faith or those with no faith at all. Janice also enjoys writing just for fun. Few of the stories in this anthology have any deeper meaning. They are simply to be enjoyed. Janice B.

After earning a master’s degree in business, he racked up thousands of frequent-flyer miles as a marketing executive and did consulting for the biopharmaceutical industry. But amidst the business proposals and annual reports sat War of the Oaks and Symphony of Ages, among others, nuggets of inspiration and the fodder for fantasy adventures.

J. learned that in the world of fiction an underdog can win. One of his first favorite reads was a novel called THE KID WHO BATTED 1.000, a tale about a last-to-first-place baseball team. Plenty corny, but he still thinks it’s better than the movie ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD. The clincher for his writing career might have been when he discovered alliteration, though he couldn’t have defined or even pronounced the word. In first grade he wrote a little tale entitled, ahem, “On Porpoise on Purpose.” He doesn't remember the details, except that his young male hero, riding the back of a big fish, performed some bold deed of great import. And no, Flipper wasn’t on TV yet. From there, he gathered enough literary acumen that his eighth grade teacher told him he had an ear for dialogue, and then somehow he won the county spelling bee, and then what seems like a few days ago he grew up, though his dear wife, son, and daughter might question that last assertion. Some honest-to-goodness authors told him he could write a bit, so he submitted a few short pieces of fiction, some of which were published. Then he picked his own underdog and wrote a novel about an amateur woman golfing against the guys, and he called it THE VICTORS CLUB. He very much wants folks to read it. Anyone can find out what S. J. is up to by checking out his website at sjcrown.com, where he blends fiction and sports together.", "related": [], "rank": 4034290, "title": "The Victors Club", "author": "S. J.

Harriet is now a widow with four grown children. Edward is still traveling the seas, enjoying his freedom. As the world starts to change and a war looms, we follow the former childhood friends and sweethearts as they deal with the ravages and realities of war in England. No one is untouched by the war, as Harriet will watch her twin sons both volunteer for service along with her daughter's husband. It will also be a time to reunite with old friends; Jane, with whom she had lost touch will become the steady rock of a friend that Harriet leaned on before she had Joe. Now with Joe gone, Jane will again become that rock. Diana Jackson doesn't pull any punches with the tragedies and realities of war and what it was like. Still, that does not diminish the glow of the story of a family once again facing the idea that dreams change and life goes on.In first Riduna and then Ancasta, we follow Harriet and Edward, who always thought their path in life would be together, but the reality of life was that it was not meant to be. Finally, in their retirement years, are they able to realize that it wasn't them who changed but the world around them and that things happened to them to make the dreams change. Diana Jackson weaves a story that is real and true and makes you feel that you are right there living it. It is a wonderful mix of the romance and realities of life with some of the technological advances of the historical time period of the novel. It is definitely a novel of moving on and never giving up, one any reader will enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": ["B00845BBHY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With the precision of a skilled prosecutor and the moral force of an Old Testament prophet, Leech reveals the power that moves the world to be actively and structurally genocidal, responsible in its greed and cold calculation for no less than ten million excess deaths a year.

Jorgensen was raised on a farm in Moses Lake, Washington. Born in the covenant and raised in the LDS Church, she grew up learning about the Gospel. Her testimony has grown through those teachings and through personal experiences both spiritual and temporal. Susan and her husband of twenty-eight years have eight children: five boys and three girls. The last child, a girl, was adopted from Russia when she was eleven months old.  At this time she is a teacher in the Relief Society. Some of her talents include painting, writing, and loving her husband, children, and friends. She has also helped facilitate healing for many people through her training in deep tissue massage. Susan has been blessed with the spiritual gifts of seeing spirits and having visions. Over the years these gifts, coupled with a burning testimony of the Holy Ghost, have strengthened Susan’s testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  She has watched others with similar gifts be deceived and led away from the Church. One of her strong desires is to help others with spiritual gifts gain a close relationship with Jesus Christ within the bounds of His Gospel. Another is to help educate members of the Church to better understand the spiritual gifts that the Lord gives to us, along with their purposes.  Because she was not practiced at oration, Susan at first tried to ignore the promptings of the Spirit to share her spiritual gifts with others. But through the years those promptings became too strong to ignore. She is now working on sharing her gifts through firesides and also through her writing and artistic talents.", "related": [], "rank": 1354649, "title": "Priceless Legacy", "author": "Susan Jorgensen", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kapoor shows that it is precisely where we feel most emotionally satisfied that we must be most suspicious.Celebrity Humanitarianismrepresents a landmark in the critique of ideology and a decisive blow in the struggle against apolitical ethicsTodd McGowan, University of Vermont\"Celebrity Humanitarianismcritiques an intriguing phenomenon: spectacularized humanitarianism. Publics are increasingly mobilized as visual witnesses to images of stars doing relief work or posing with newly transnationally adopted children; \"benevolent\"corporate billionaires on redemptive missions in Africa; or iconic manoeuvres of semiotically savvy NGOs. Against the popular adulation of these figures or their liberal recuperation, Kapoor's brilliant Zizekian analysis complicates this picture with a disarming thesis: celebrity humanitarianism legitimates and indeed promotes liberal capitalism and perpetuates global inequity. This is an enjoyable yet critical, serious and non-celebratory approach to celebrity and corporate philanthropy, as well as the disavowal characteristic of our post-political age.\"Diane Rubenstein, Cornell University, USA \"This short book is engaging, witty and it carries an important message.

With cake tester position in short supply and impaired vision putting a halt to those loftier ambitions, Jason settled on a career in the travel industry which afforded him the ability to indulge of another great passion – travelling. Thanks to various positions with travel organizers, agents and airlines Jason got to visit more than thirty countries and travel around the world. Following a redundancy and a chance encounter during the early 1990’s Jason secured a job with a local radio station and thus a career in media began. He went on to produce and present a number of radio shows and programmes for a number of local radio stations in the UK as well as hosting a series of video travel brochures and corporate films. It was whilst working in the radio industry than Jason was asked to write an article for a local newspaper in Essex and then a regular column. It was this start with the written word that ignited a fire of desire that had always burned somewhere deep within Jason’s mind and since then he has written countless articles, features, news stories and columns for various on and off line publications and in 2012 produced his first non-fiction book – The Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time.

Growing up in the country, Fragoza experienced a childhood unlike you would receive in suburbia. With not much access to electronics, he was forced to play outside and make his own fun.

The wonderful clients that we are lucky enough to work with help us to learn so much. Even though the results they achieve are almost life transforming to them, to us they are even more wonderful. Being able to help people live better, healthier, more confident and longer lives AND get paid for it is an amazingly great position to be in.One of the other great things about being a personal trainer is the amount of free time I have. I use this time mainly to put in to writing the knowledge and experience that I have gained from working with my clients. I feel privileged to be able to test first hand any dietary or fitness related breakthroughs that burst on to the scene. In fact many of my programs feature this 'insider' knowledge.In all of my books I give you PROVEN techniques which have been tested and perfected on my own clients... we've made the mistakes so that you don't have to do!I try to write in a simple and easy to understand way because I understand how difficult it can be to grasp some concepts that many so called 'experts' weave in to complex mines of information to convince you that you need them to decipher the information they have.I love writing and sharing my lifelong library of tips and techniques with anyone who'll listen to them.

Walker and Carter G. Woodson). The texts, which were originally published in the early 1990s, are clearly written and presented in a clean design. Captions for the full-color photos and illustrations provide additional information and the further reading and websites have been updated. Some of the text-heavy pages might present a problem for lower-level readers, but overall, the language is simple and straightforward. Challenging vocabulary is set in a bold font and defined in the glossaries.

In a house filled with family, friends and pets, she sometimes laments the lack of time just to sit down and write, though surrounded by those she loves, she wouldn’t have it any other way.  Patricia falls in love with the heroes she writes about each and every time she puts their lives down on paper. She loves sexy men and hates her villains more than the reader does. It helps to hate the bad guys. It makes the story so much richer. She realized a very long time ago that the world is filled with people who live diverse and amazing lifestyles and she tries to capture the beauty of such diversity in her writing.  Patricia has had a diverse career life. She’s been a jeweler, an AIDS hospice nurse and a “dreaded” mortgage broker. She hopes that the various walks of life she’s taken come out in her work. A busy mother of four and a “stage mom” for her youngest, she always seems to be in motion.

Some rumor that someone started long ago. It could be true, it\ncould be myth, it could be completely made up.   Sounds like an\nadventure waiting to happen for me.   What got me\ninterested in hidden attractions as a teenager was just that. A couple of local\nstories I heard passed along, or read somewhere, that got me going off the\nbeaten path. I grew up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which was a quiet\nbeachscape turned tourist mecca because of the beautiful golden beaches and\nwarm climate. The preponderance of famous landmarks and historical events didn't\nhurt. But I knew all about that stuff. And while I could have whiled away the\nsummertime in blissful ennui with sand happily stuck between my suntanned toes,\nI chose to, occasionally, take a different path.   My first discovery\nwas a little hidden monument built back on a soundside road for the Wright\nBrothers. Just a little pillar, not even as tall as me. But I found it. I knew\nabout it, and others didn't. Added to\nthat was this legend I heard that there was, written in Braille, a history of\nflight somewhere in the big monument, which towered nearby my home all my life,\nbut was forever impenetrable. No one was allowed to enter. A forbidden pillar\nof mystery was all I saw.   Now, years and numerous\nadventures across the nation and continent, I finally have begun to collect all\nthe unique little bits of roadside oddity. And some of the big ones, too. Over\n90 different locations are listed in this book, and each includes the latitude\nand longitude coordinates for every strange and not so strange place I found.   That's why I\nreally wrote the book. While I enjoyed gathering the history, facts, and\nlegends for all these attractions, the big problem I had in finding them was\nthis. All the other books that had some of these things listed barely told me\nwhere they were. Sometimes just a city or general location. Some don't even\nhave an address. They are 100 feet of the road in the woods, or just ... there.\nWith Did You See That? the reader can find exactly what they are looking for.\nThey can also decide if something is even worth looking for. Believe me, after a couple of wild barking\ndogs, some of these places aren't worth the journey. But it is still nice\nknowing about them.   And that Braille\nwriting in the monument? I found that, too. Hidden away in the National Park\nService storage is an octagonal brass plaque showing major achievements in\nflight up until the time the monument was built.   That one is in the\nbook, too.Good hunting,Joe Sledge", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Preaching self-reliance and entrepreneurial initiative, she reduced taxes, privatized nationalized industry and curtailed trade union power during her 11-year tenure, which ended in 1990. Dellheim, an Arizona State University history professor, argues that these measures were necessary to stem Britain's long economic decline, which he traces to the immediate postwar period, when an expensive welfare state was erected while both labor and management blocked modernization, each more intent on exploiting, rather than reforming, a faulty system. Under Thatcher, living standards rose for many, foreign investments rebounded, inflation was temporarily halted. Yet her policies aggravated old inequalities, further polarizing rich and poor, and this sweeping history blames her failure partly on \"moral arrogance,\" on her \"indifferent or mean-spirited attitude to those who could not help themselves.\"Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2215783, "title": "The Disenchanted Isle", "author": "Charles Dellheim", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Man Hunt became the number one best selling erotic novel on the Publisher's website in 2006 and has been translated into German. She loves writing erotic short stories. Highlander is the second in her Forbidden Fantasy series along with Take Me and The Lover. Highlander is special to her because she dreamed the story - about a dispossessed Scottish noble named James, who had to fight to get his land back. She followed this up with Highlander in her bed and is currently working on her Highlander series. She has also sold Psychic Sex and Shift into Pleasure to Harlequin Spice Briefs. Psychic Sex was included in the Naughty Bits Anthology. Finally, she thought she'd better write something her mother could read. Her romantic paranormal mystery, Tempting Trouble, a novel set in a waxing parlor was re-released as an indie, quickly followed by her September 2013 sale of Love, Lust and Lies to Harlequin. Her Demon Prince, an erotic paranormal romance is an August 2013 release.

We had been up half the night last night with\n Fallyn. Her ass was having contractions so Adrian rushed her to the\nhospital only for it to be a false alarm. Well I wasn't having that shit\n tonight. If that bitch breaks my rest tonight it better be the real\ndeal. Her ass is always being extra. She could have waited that shit out\n a while longer but noooo she just had to have the attention on her. She\n was already on my shit list. I had a half of mind to cuss her ass out\nfor that damn coyote remark she made the other night.\"Damn these contractions are kicking my ass!\" Fallyn thought to herself as she rubbed her huge tight belly.She\n had just finished eating and had stretched out in the family room to\nwatch her afternoon lineup. She was trying her best to ignore the sharp\npains that pulsated through her abdomen seeing as her OB GYN had sent\nher back home last night telling her that she hadn't dilated enough. \"Ouch!\"Fallyn\n winced in pain as she attempted to get up and go in her room lie in her\n own bed. As soon as she turned the corner in the hallway she caught\nanother pain that caused her knees to buckle.\"Oh shit!\"She\n looked down to see gush of liquid that had flowed from between her legs\n and was now running down her thighs. Her water had broken. She used her\n hand to brace herself against the doorframe and called for help.\"Help me!\" Fallyn called out.I popped my eyes open from what was about to be a perfect afternoon nap to hear Fallyn moaning and squealing in the hallway.\"Whaaaatt? Damn!\" I yelled from my room. I had just laid my ass down and I wasn't about to get up.\"Help me dammit! I'm in labor!\"\"Aww\n shit here we go with this shit again.\" I jumped up mad as hell and\nstormed out of the bedroom and down the hall. I was just about to tell\nthis bitch to get her life when I she scream out again.\"Hurry up! My water broke!\" Fallyn cried.I\n totally ignored that shit she was talking when I looked down and saw\nthe huge pink wet spot on my damn white carpet. \"I know you didn't just\nfuck up my carpet?\"\"I'm having the baby dumb ass! Is that all you can worry about is your damn carpet?\"I\n was about to grab the cleaning solution for the rug and have that heffa\n spot clean it until I looked at her face. She was clearly in distress.\n\"Maybe she is having the baby for real this time\" I thought.\"So you for real this time?\" I asked looking her writhing body up and down.\"I\n was for real the last time! AHH!! SHIT!!\" Fallyn bent over and grasped\nher belly. What were sharp twinges had now turned into full-fledged\ncontractions. \"I need to get to the hospital before I have this baby\nright here, lemme call Adrian.\"I\n had to think quickly. If she really was having the baby I didn't want\nher calling anyone. I'm the head bitch in charge and I would see that\nshe got to the hospital.\"Ok Ok..... Lemme help you to the car.\" I attempted to put my arm around her but she started flailing her arms frantically.\"Noooo get your hands off of me! I want Adrian!\"\"I know you do bitch\" I thought to myself.Fallyn\n made a final attempt to make it to her room to grab her cell phone but\nher knees failed her and started to buckle. Just as she was about to\nfall I threw my arms around her waist and stared dragging her towards\nthe front door.\"Look at you, you can't even walk.\"\"Stop it! Somebody help me!\" Fallyn swung and struck me cutting my top lip.\"You betta settle yo ass down! I'm trying to help you bitch; now stop fighting me and get yo ass in this car!\" I sneered.Fallyn wanted to continue to fight but it was useless, she was too weak. And the contractions were now five minutes apart.\"What about my bag? And we need to call Adrian!\" she protested as I shoved her into the car.\"No time for that I'll come back for it.\"There\n was time but I wasn't trying to hear that shit she was talking. Not\nonly was I going to be the one to call Adrian. I didn't want her to have\n her bag till I got a chance to snoop through it first. Ain't no telling\n what her sneaky ass might be up to.\"Yo crazy ass betta take me straight to the hospital or I swear.....\"\"You\n swear what? All you need to be worrying about is not messing up my damn\n seats. Close yo damn legs!\" I snapped as I tasted the blood from my top\n lip.\"Unbelievable!\n I'm having a..... baby and all you can think about is material shit, you\nshellfish bitch! That's how I know yo twisted ass.... don't need a child.\"\"Don't piss me off Fallyn! Shut yo ass up and ride! I love that baby, imma make a good momma\" I said glancing at her belly.\"Please... you don't..... know the meaning...... of the word.... you selfish and hateful.\" Fallyn had started breathing heavy, heaving and gasping between her words.\"That's....\n why yo ass going crazy. I be hearing you...... in there talking to yo self,\n sound like a man. Who.... is it Peyton? I hope his ass...... don't come out\nwhile you driving. You done.... already pushed Adrian away.... crying like\nBarry White. Yo ass.... was howling like... you was on Twilight, scared... the\n shit outta me. I had to... make sure... Adrian was alright.\"The bitch tried to laugh but instead she was hit with another pain.I\n cut my eyes at that hoe. \"That's what yo ass gets. Keep talking shit\nand yo ass gon end up in the trauma center when we get here instead of\nlabor and delivery.\"", "related": ["B00HVJNS7A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.45, "rating_total": 89.0}

The authors are well-established qualitative researchers and have pulled off a great text for the beginning researcher.”(Matthew A. Eichler 2011-10-28)“The key strength of this text is the discussion and presentation of how to think about qualitative research. This is the only text that discusses the process of thinking before doing at any stage of the research project from the general idea to the writing up and submitting for publication. This kind of discussion is extremely helpful for novice or experienced researchers as it helps them to take a step back in the middle of the research process, rethink clearly and improve the project.”(Ruth Segal 2011-10-28)“This book combines the basics of qualitative research methods (why we choose qualitative over quantitative when we are trying to answer specific questions about human behavior) and the nuts and bolts of how to actually do qualitative research. I like that it explains qualitative research from conceptualization to writing up the results. Not a lot of textbooks accomplish this – they allude to a lot, but they don’t include the necessary information that this textbook includes.”(Rhonda R. Buckley 2011-10-28)“The text is very clear and well organized, and accessible for new students. In comparison to many other introductory texts, it really brings to the fore the need for theoretical and methodological coherence.”(Irina L. G.

Shipped to Australia to start a new life, the children are separated and so begins Maggie's struggle to prove her mother still lives and to bring the family back together.Based on actual events, this beautifully written story had me gripped and emotionally attached to the characters and their struggles. Apparently well researched, it provides some insight into the long term impact of the events unfolding between 1939 and 1945, without being clichéd. The tireless work and battles with 'red tape' of the organisations involved in evacuation and subsequent repatriation of thousands of children over this period, is aptly represented in the story.The writing style is engaging and accurate, with fully rounded and believable characters. I will not only be recommending this book but also looking to read more of this authors work. Not every story has a happy ending, but maybe this one does?", "related": ["B00I9H35U8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

He is a regular columnist and casual short story writer for the national quarterly newspaper Senior Lifetimes, from Edmonton Alt-distributed from British Columbia to Ontario.  As Michael C. Hammar, he appeared on stage as a feature at more than a dozen home shows a year, hosted and wrote a national television series, \"Don't Move Improve\" and hosted a weekly call-in radio show from 1971 to 2000. Peckham studied with Terry Valentine, author and teacher from Oak Ridge Writer's Group and Writer's Digest Online University.  Even though his many years in the home improvement industry qualifies him to write extensively on the subject he fell in love with fiction and has produced story after story. Peckham says, \"Writing is my way of life and an outlet for my creative mind.  At this point in my life I would rather create a mystery story than travel.  In my stories I can travel to all parts of the globe and into the deepest portals of my mind.\" Peckham was born and raised in Niagara Falls Ontario, but now makes Kelowna British Columbia his home. His wife Lynn is his inspiration and mentor in all his writing. Lynn and Bill entertain at many seniors' facilities around Kelowna. When people ask what they play Bill says Lynn sings and plays the electronic keyboard and he sings and plays the fool.

Variational methods, rooted in physics and mechanics, but appearing in many other domains, such as statistics, control, and computer vision, address a problem from an optimization standpoint, i.e., they formulate it as the optimization of an objective function or functional. The methods of image motion analysis described in this book use the calculus of variations to minimize (or maximize) an objective functional which transcribes all of the constraints that characterize the desired motion variables. The book addresses the four core subjects of motion analysis: Motion estimation, detection, tracking, and three-dimensional interpretation. Each topic is covered in a dedicated chapter. The presentation is prefaced by an introductory chapter which discusses the purpose of motion analysis.

Like his favorite philosopher, William James, he is interested in the inner life of psychology and states of consciousness. He balances that introspective tendency with numerous physical activities and concerns about the external world of nature, politics, social justice and the history of ideas. He got his elementary education in two-room country schools and earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Columbia University.

After failing to make the grade as a professional football player, he spent much of his early years traveling, hitch-hiking around Europe and North Africa and then heading to Asia. His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months. He is a bestseller in Europe and his work has sold into translation in 23 countries: Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year.

The concept of The Challenge is to create something of value in just30 days, by watching the daily videos and \"chunking\" down content creation into small, achievable daily tasks.The Challengeruns yearly, and I participated from the1st September to the 30th September 2013. I was not able to finish the book on time, but was able to finally finish and publish on the11th of November.There were many difficult moments along the road, and the journey was both painful and joyous, exhausting and exhilarating. I think most people can say the same of any large project that they have undertaken. I amtruly ecstaticto see my name published through Amazon, and recommend the experience to everyone.My main career path is in inInformation Technology, and thus the concept of an eBook was very intriguing to me. I won't be pushing this book or forcing myself to create new content, as I have many other things that demand my time. I am however interested in publishing books for others, and seek to do so in the future.

It just seemed like something the people in my family did. I do know we always favored fiction. My dad adored the Horatio Hornblower series by C. S. Forester. He even took up ship-modeling as a result. My mom loved big, flashy historical novels like Mika Waltari’s The Egyptian and James Clavell’s Shogun. As a grown up, my brother read everything Tom Clancy wrote. As for me, I’ve been hooked on fiction since grade school. And I’ve always preferred stories that supplied adventure and escape. Humor and wit help, too. I try to write the same sort of stories and novels as the ones I read. So far I’ve written ten novels including Walls, a Cinderella, P. I. Novel, the first of two novels based on some of the twenty-nine fairy tale mystery stories I’ve written about Cinderella, P. I., twenty years, three kids and a few extra pounds after the ball. Currently, I’m working Wings, a Cinderella, P. I. Novel, the sequel to Walls. It follows Cinderella as she goes home to rescue Prince Charming, their children, and the Kingdom of AzureSky from their sneaky, selfish, irresponsible foes. (This sounds serious, I know, but you need shadows in order to see the bright side of life.) I’ve written these novels and stories to entertain myself and my friends. I hope they do the same for you, dear reader.", "related": ["B00E42TZQ0"], "rank": 1671977, "title": "Cinderella, P. I. and Other Fairy Tale Mystery Stories (The Cinderella P. I.

However, this was one case where my memory and OCD tendencies helped me. Graduation was one of the most amazing days of my life. But, my most amazing day was when my now husband proposed. Every little girl dreams of being Cinderella someday, and he pulled off the proposal of fantasies.At the risk of sounding cliche, I'm going to let it out there and say how much I absolutely adore the man I'm married to. Along with my children, he's my whole world.I've lived in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Georgia, but I've had my feet in almost every state.

This is a short ride and we have to make the very most of it! Jason has had a career, which is as wide and varied as his hopes and dreams. Having tried a bit of everything, from managing retail stores, to being an investment broker for a world-class firm as well as a mortgage professional; during the recession he waited tables and did temp work, eventually working his way back up the ranks to sales manager and then finance director of a high-end automobile dealership. Through all the changes, even when the money was good, one thing remained the same: Jason felt unfulfilled. After deciding that nothing was worth living a life of misery, he shifted gears and decided to spend time pursuing his true calling. It was decision time--and he chose to go after his life's purpose, to find and fulfill his own higher calling of helping others to go after their own. In his day to day life, Jason has always enjoyed close personal relationships with a number of friends from all walks of life, and has enjoyed being a sounding board and de facto life coach to them in their lives.  The launch of his first book, BREAK FREE! Don't Waste Another Minute Living Somebody Else's Dream, represents a catharsis to him--a culmination of the lessons he gleaned through his life experience. He is now focused on bringing quality content to his readers, and bringing hope and inspiration into people's lives. Jason is a vegetarian who loves to read, travel, and spend time with friends and family having new adventures. He loves to help people and is passionate about lifting people up and standing up for the underdog.", "related": [], "rank": 1041561, "title": "BREAK FREE!

Drew grew up in sunny Los Angeles where he was first introduced to the marijuana culture and community. His interest in its many medicinal and recreational uses was the catalyst which caused him to first try marijuana and gain the valuable insight that he possesses today.      His books are aimed toward the recreational user and offer a direct view into the world of using marijuana and enhancing your experiences with it. Drew has over 12 years of experience using marijuana responsibly and effectively; his methods teach readers how to get the most from their marijuana usage whether it is their first time or one hundredth.  With the legality of marijuana usage becoming more mainstream and soon to hit a nationwide level, Drew’s books have become an incredible resource and a portal into the world of recreational marijuana usage Taking a bilateral approach to the often misunderstood and at times enigmatic world of marijuana, the expert author's account of marijuana usage explores just about every angle known to man, as the singular goal of the pro-pot advocate is simply to spread awareness about marijuana and to educate people about all that there is to know about the mystified plant. Throughout the well-researched content of his publications, backed up by years of practical experience in all things related to marijuana usage, the Los Angles-raised author aptly covers both the potential benefits of marijuana usage as well as the potentially harmful effects of it, if it is abused. After all, it is these two extremes (the good and the bad side of marijuana usage) that are a clear cause for the ongoing political quandary surrounding the legalization, or part thereof, of marijuana usage. Drew's literary coverage of marijuana usage currently spans over four publications, with his book titles including: - Stoner Quotes - Speak On It: Celebrity Quotes About Marijuana", "related": [], "rank": 2735504, "title": "Speak On It: Celebrity Quotes About Marijuana", "author": "Drew Breeze", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In that one glance I saw\neverything I had hoped to see, but magnified far past anything I had ever\nimagined. A slow shiver crept down my spine as I got my first real glimpse of\nthe kind of intensity this man was capable of, and I knew right then that\nhowever the night went it wasn't going to be anything at all like it had played\nout in my little fantasies.\"I'm fine,\" I\nwhispered.Slowly Steven eased\nback into his chair, eyes still locked on mine, lips turned upwards in a\ntwisted little smile. \"Good. So what's for dinner?\"\"Shrimp scampi.\nI'll go get it out of the oven.\"\"Great. I'm\nstarved.\"Even though I\ndidn't look back I knew that his eyes never left me as I returned to the\nkitchen.While I was gone\nhe must have taken a firmer grip on himself, because when I came back in Steven\nwas relaxed as a cat and there was nothing remotely resembling confusion or\ndoubt in those smoldering, golden brown eyes. He watched me with frank\nappreciation as I padded up and sat a steaming plate before him, and I was more\nthan just a little self-conscious about this sudden new scrutiny.This was a side\nof Steven I had never seen before. He was completely self assured and at ease,\neffortlessly funny and charming, and the looks he was giving me while I ate had\nme all wet and trembly before I got down half a dozen bites. Even so, he\nmanaged to relax me a little with jokes and stories about his flying days in\nthe Marines while he sipped his wine and cleaned his plate. He had me so\nmesmerized that I didn't even realize that both our plates were empty until\nSteven pushed his away and tipped his chair back.\"Oh, I almost\nforgot about dessert!\"I scurried to\nthe kitchen and leaned my forehead against the refrigerator. My heart stuttered\nand skipped while warm waves coursed through my center and swirled around my\nlower belly. Under Steven's shirt my breasts felt hot and heavy and my nipples\nwere hard enough to cut glass. And he hadn't even touched me yet. I was\nterrified that when he finally did I'd be ready to get on my knees and beg for\nanything he'd give me.But I couldn't\nhide in the kitchen forever.I came out with\ncoffee and a blackberry pie, and I had let my hair down so it hung like a dark,\nsilken waterfall halfway down my back. Steven's eyes lit up, but I wasn't sure\nif it was because of the dessert or me. He didn't leave me in suspense for\nlong; as soon as I unloaded everything onto the table he reached out and the\nnext thing I knew I was sitting on his lap with his arms around my waist and\nhis lips nuzzling against my ear.\"I love that\nperfume,\" he growled softly. \"You'll have to wear it more often.\"He smelled\npretty spectacular himself--tangy spice and cedar mixed with sexy male--and that\ncombined with the heat of his body against mine had me melting like warm\nbutter. In my depths a flutter kicked off with a powerful ache of longing that\nmade me whimper. I was ready for him to clear off a spot on the table then rip\noff my clothes and take me right there.Oh, who was I\nkidding? I didn't care if he cleared a spot on the table first.His hands crept\nslowly up my stomach to cup my breasts, and I shuddered as his thumbs found the\nhard knobs of my nipples and massaged them with gentle swirls. Lips latched\nonto my earlobe and the moist heat of his breath tickled against my neck.\"You've been\ntrying so hard to make me notice you. Is this what you wanted, Lexie?\"\"Yes.\" It was\nthe only word I could manage while his breath worked across my skin.\"Are you sure?\nBecause once we do it you can't take it back.\"\"Yes.Please.\"He gave a\nthroaty chuckle. \"Your dad is going to kill both of us.\"At that moment I\ndidn't remotely care.", "related": [], "rank": 1100236, "title": "Lexie's Last Chance: An Older Man Younger Woman Romance", "author": "Kelli Wolfe", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Personally, I\nprefer the latter.I am retired from business now, or so I keep telling\nmyself. All I want to do is write\nscreenplays while sitting out here in the country with my bossy African Grey\nparrot, but the other half of me is still passionate about business. I have started this business series of eBooks,SMARTYPANTS GUIDE TO BUSINESS,for\nthose who are just starting out as an entrepreneur. I've learned a lot about\ndoing business from trial and error, from other business owners and from some\nof the best salespeople you could ever stand to speak with. Now it is time to share what I've learned\nwith anyone who needs to be pointed in the direction of success.The company I owned the longest was a craft supplies company\nwhere I was always one of the top couple of companies in the field. I was the only one in that industry who\nbelieved that if I taught my customers how to turn their hobby into a successful\nbusiness then they'd make more money. If\nmy customers made more money selling their crafted items then my company would\nmake more money. And that is how it\nturned out. Twice I won awards for being\none of the fastest growing corporations in the state of Utah because of that\nphilosophy and because I offered excellent customer service with the highest\nquality of products. My time is now spent between writing those screenplays and\ndoing business writing for others. I\nalso consult on online marketing, help business owners get their products\napproved for Amazon's FBA program, write enticing product descriptions and do other\ntypes of writing for companies and their websites.I wish you great success with your new company and products.Pam", "related": [], "rank": 2347826, "title": "SMARTYPANTS GUIDE TO BUSINESS - Product Price Secrets", "author": "Pamela S.

Readers seeking more than one-dimensional descriptions of on-and-off\npassions will findMurder on the Hoofjust the ticket, steeped in the\nironies, twists, and multi-layered emotions that make for a realistic,\nabsorbing read.\" - D.
