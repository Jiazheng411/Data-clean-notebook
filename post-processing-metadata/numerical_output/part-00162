Instead, through a meticulous and incisive examination of the major and minor writers on the subject, Styers shows that the highly pliable, always shifty, devious, and problematic category of magic has been an extremely effective device with which to define and to empower that which it is not: religion proper, (real) science, rationality, modernity.

Sophia Gable made the observation as she drew her elderly yellow car to a stop outside Grey Barlow's country home. 'Or in this case it's where he comes to recuperate from an accident.'The house sat part way up an unspoiled section of Victorian mountainside, a large, solid structure made of slate and stone and mortar with a weathered roof of terracotta tiles. Vines twined about the veranda posts. Meadows full of wild flowers bloomed in every direction. Beyond those, snow-capped mountains rose in early spring splendour.It was a change from the hustle and bustle of Melbourne, but Soph was adaptable. She glanced at the white flop-eared domestic rabbit that rested, nose twitching, in a deep basket strapped to the front passenger seat of the car. Alfred might also enjoy the change of scene.Despite Soph's efforts to remain calm, a small bout of nerves surfaced. This was a change of more than just her usual city surroundings. She sucked in a steadying breath. Her career change had been the right thing and for her first assignment she got to help a man in need, which she knew she would find fulfilling. It was all perfect. There was nothing to worry about.Nothing except the fact that Soph had used up three of her four weeks of financial buffer zone before the We Work for You agency had given her this first posting. But the agency would see this proof of her versatility and skill and go on to send her into all sorts of varied jobs where she could help others and feel great as she did so.Soph climbed out of the car, twitched her fluffy cerise jumper and black trousers into place and spared just a moment to admire the matching crimson ankle boots. With a cheerful expression pasted on to her face, she headed for the house and climbed the steps to the veranda.'You'reSophia Gable, the assistant I acquired through the staffing agency?' The question came as a low rumble of sound from a corner of the veranda where the speaker would have had a perfect view of Gertie the Beetle's arrival, and Soph's exodus from said car. 'I thought you'd be older, less colourful.'Was it the crimson tips in her hair? They probably looked a bit metallic in the sunlight, now Soph thought about it, but she'd wanted power hair for this fresh start. She squinted into the shadowed corner.'I'm Sophia, but most people call me Soph. I hope you will too, Mr Barlow.' Despite the shadows, she could make out a cast on his arm and one foot in an ankle brace, stuck out awkwardly in front of him where he sat in an outdoor chair.Poor fellow, but at least his injuries were temporary. 'The position outline said clerical with a bit of housekeeping and cooking, other general duties and assistance related to your injuries as required. I want to assure you I'm prepared for all contingencies. I've given quite a bit of thought to how I can best assist in your recovery.''You can assist by performing the required tasks and driving me places when needed. I'm certain nothing else will be necessary.' He rapped the words out with every appearance of annoyance and even a hint of suspicion. 'My injuries are simple, after all.' Following this pronouncement he glared and said, 'I'm merely dealing with a sprained ankle and a broken arm. There's nothing at all to fuss about.''That's a very positive outlook.' Though a bit taken aback, Soph tried to put a good spin on his grouchiness. The man may have placed his injuries last on his list of needs with the agency, but they were still needs. He might require a little coaxing to accept help with them. That was all. 'Even so, I have lots of great ideas—''Sit down, please.' He interrupted her without compunction and gestured towards the chair opposite his. 'At least you're not late, but I don't have a lot of time for pleasantries.'Soph moved forward and got a proper look at him. 'I thought you'd be older. It's always the way when we anticipate meeting someone, isn't it? We tend to imagine something quite different to the reality.'She wondered what made him so defensive about his injuries, but didn't have time to think about it now.In truth, she was a little distracted. Now she could see him properly, she acknowledged that he was rather impressively packaged. Broad-shouldered, dark-haired, he had a chiselled face and stormy green eyes and not an ounce of spare flesh on him anywhere. She'd place him in his mid-thirties.He said in a dry tone, 'I'm sure we'll manage to get over our mutual astonishment.''Yes. I guess so.' Despite his dryness and his wounded irritability, he had a presence. There was something compelling about him.Soph's pulse skittered, but she rejected her reaction. The man was a stranger, not in her social or economic set, at least a decade older than her, and her employer to boot.When Soph chose to date, it was with average guys her own age and financial status, and she made it clear she only wanted company for an evening out or two. If they started to want a piece of her soul or anything similar, she was out of there.One day, a long time in the future, Soph might want to choose someone more permanent from among those very ordinary men but it would have to be a relationship she could control, and she would have to feel ready.Something told her that Grey Barlow couldn't be ordinary or controllable if he tried. Nor did he seem the kind who would seek permanency, certainly not if it came with the picket fence she imagined she might some day want. Well, her sisters had both fallen for it.With millionaires of their own, no less, and in spite of the trust issues they had carried, thanks to their deserting parents.Soph hadn't suffered like Bella and Chrissy. Her older sisters had shielded her, allowed her to live a normal and happy life after their parents had abandoned them, even when things had been at their toughest. Nope. Soph had no hang-ups, just a lot of gratitude and love and the wish that she could have done more for Chrissy and Bella in return.'I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Barlow. I hope we'll have a satisfying association while I work for you.'Thiswas the point. Something new and interesting to do, something which would drive away her restlessness, give her a feeling of completion, a feeling that she had contributed in a pleasing way. She simply liked to help people, and wanted more of a chance to do so.'The agency assured me you were the best they had to offer.'After a brief hesitation in which he lifted his right hand, frowned in annoyance and dropped it down again, he reached out his undamaged left one.Did he have to sound so dubious about her? Soph hoped he hadn't got that impression from the agency itself. She reached out her left hand too. 'I'll do my utmost to live up to your expectations.'The back to front handshake was firm and quickly over. It should have felt impersonal or simply awkward, but a flash of heat travelled up her arm and into her chest. She thought she saw a matching momentary reaction in his gaze.Of course her response was a glitch, since she'd decided it wouldn't be wise to notice him in that way.As for him, a second glance revealed nothing but a blank mask. She had probably imagined anything else.He began to rap out words. 'On doctor's orders, I've agreed to a break here for the next week. I concede the fresh air and change of scenery probably won't do me any harm, although I think my doctor is being overly cautious about my…health.'After the week here, I'll relocate to my town house in Melbourne.You'll carry out your work for me at both locations.''I'll do my best to assist you.' The town house would have a garden, a place for Alfred's collapsible enclosure. That was a good thing. She needed to explain about Alfie, how she'd found the domestic pet abandoned, tied to a pole near her flat just last night and now needed to keep him with her.Her employer gave a nod. 'Aside from the duties you mentioned earlier, you'll screen all my phone calls and turn away any person who might appear here at the house. I've made it clear I don't want visitors, but some people might try to ignore that fact.'No visitors, huh? If Soph had a broken arm and a damaged ankle, her sisters and brothers-in-law would be all over her. They'd tell her how to get better, bring her food and comfort. Actually, they'd probably insist she go to live with one or the other of them until she made a complete recovery.She wondered about Grey Barlow's family. Maybe he didn't want his work colleagues or relatives to see him at less than his best. It made a proud male kind of sense. In response to this thought, she smiled at him extra kindly. 'If anyone tries to get inside the house, I'll be better than a Pekingese. They won't know what's—''Bitten them?' He finished the sentence for her and a wry smile touched his lips.'Do Pekingese bite? I think they just yap, don't they?' Soph's heart pitter-pattered. He looked younger and more approachable when he smiled. Could she be blamed for noticing? 'Do you have pets, Mr Barlow? You see, I have this—''No, I don't do the pet thing.' The hint of a smile disappeared, replaced by a frown. 'I'd find that kind of commitment restricting.'Maybe she wouldn't mention Alfie's presence just yet. And definitely no picket fences on this man's horizon if he couldn't even cope with the thought of a pet responsibility. She'd been right about that, and it was fine with her.'Perhaps we could get back to our discussion of your duties?' He sounded irritable again. 'Although I'm incarcerated here for no good reason, I concede that I can't physically cover ten floors of office space every day or go out to examine the construction sites in Melbourne and beyond until my ankle is better. But Iwillkeep my finger on the pulse of the company.'I'll keep in touch by electronic conferencing. I'll also review and respond to written reports from the various departments daily.' He paused to draw a breath.

They were all individuals with varying degrees of influence and power, each one committed to the older values of what had been the Soviet Union and distrustful of the way things were going in the New Russia. Each had a deep-rooted suspicion concerning America, watching the imperialistic moves the U.S. was making across the globe, and fearful that if it was allowed to continue, even Russia might be swept aside by the American monolith. Thoughts of armed confrontation with America was not to be considered within the near future. The downgrading of the once mighty Soviet war machine had removed its sting. It no longer had the mass of machines and men. The fracturing of the Soviet Empire had weakened its threat. It would take some considerable time to build up military superiority to its earlier strength.When Berienko finished, he indicated that it was Krushen's turn. A rumble of agitation rose from the group as it assessed what Berienko had said and Krushen allowed the moment to pass. He considered his options before he spoke, knowing that the men seated around the table were as committed as he was to Black Judas, but were still nervous as to the outcome if the project was brought into play.\"America has grown fat and greedy since the fall of the Soviet Union. It has reached out and used our demise to swell its wealth and influence. It has done it under the guise of helping Russia reconstruct. Admirable on the surface but by no means a selfless act. The Americans do nothing for nothing. Somewhere there is always the catch. There are those who do it by stealth. They employ others, often Russians themselves, to broker their deals for them. It allows them to infiltrate under a smoke screen. They manipulate or they buy or they bribe. They offer us their gifts like they did to the Indian tribes in their own country. Blankets and beads, trinkets to bedazzle while they stole land and slaughtered the buffalo. Now they do it with fast-food franchises. Burgers, and coffee in paper cups. And the people clamor for more, because they are blind to the larger picture. And all the while the deals go on behind closed doors. For Russian money and oil. Anything the Americans can add to their treasure chest. Nothing is done to halt this greed. Our so-called leaders do little except pretend concern, so we need to make things happen, and soon.\"\"Mischa, as much as we love the sound of your voice, is there a point to all this?\"The speaker was a stoop-shouldered man with a shock of white hair framing his lined, old face. He was Georgi Bella, a Georgian with a fearsome reputation. He was old-guard KGB, and still a force to be reckoned with.\"With respect, Georgi, I am coming to the point. America wants to dominate. It is as simple as that. Look at the way they made war on Iraq. To get rid of Hussein? His demise was a bonus, something to add to the main prize. First they destroy the country and then return with their people and get money to rebuild. Again this was just a ploy to detract from the main prize. The oil. America would like nothing better than to get its hands onouroil, and they will try every trick in the book to achieve that. They want Middle Eastern oil, as well. To control it. To feed their greedy population and to maintain their war machine. In quiet rooms negotiations go on. Contracts are signed and deals are negotiated. All done behind the scenes by means of manipulation and coercion. The Americans are very good at this kind of thing. They have a sure ingredient that gets them what they want.\"\"What is that? Fried chicken in a box and bottles of cola?\" someone said.A ripple of laughter followed. Krushen allowed it to flow, easing the mood for a moment.\"Money,\" he said as the laughter settled down. \"America lives and breathes on its fabulous wealth. It is what keeps the country alive. They have so much, yet they crave even more, and what it brings them. Power. Influence. If they can't get what they want by flexing their military muscle, they use money. It makes them believe nothing is impossible for them. But I think it is also what makes them vulnerable. America exists on a knife edge of uncertainty. If Wall Street draws breath, the country panics. At even the hint of a financial problem, shares tumble. The interest rate fluctuates. Millions can be lost in an instant.\"\"All very well, but how does it help us?\" Bella asked.\"By understanding America's vulnerability, we have something to attack. Not with missiles. But by going for the financial heart. By destroying the U.S.A.'s financial power base.\"\"Black Judas?\" Bella asked.Krushen smiled and tapped the file resting on the table in front of him.\"Exactly. By using this,\" he said. He picked up the file and let the assembly see it. \"We activate Black Judas and put it into operation. It is the right time. America is vulnerable at this moment. The dollar is weak. Hit the U.S. financial base now and we can throw the economy into recession. Use the skills of the Black Judas team to bring America to her knees, then take advantage of that weakness to gain control of the financial markets.\"\"You make it sound too easy,\" Bella said.\"It won't be easy, but the rewards could be incredible.\"Bella nodded. \"That is the part I am interested in.Ifit works.\"\"The team we put in place will make sure it works. The day the project goes into operation, the knowledge these men will have gained becomes vital.\"\"You are talking about individuals who have been in place for almost seven years,\" Bella said. \"How do we know they have stayed loyal? Or were matters like this not included in your master plan?\"\"All those things and more were considered, Georgi. An operation such as Black Judas required much planning. Fail-safes were built in. Six men. Three teams of two. We spread them across the American continent. Each team carried codes that would allow it to access Black Judas and bring it online. In reality all we needed were two men to survive. Each one carrying one half of the access code. Their codes will be combined and Black Judas brought online.\"Bella nodded. \"And have you had these men watched? Are they all still alive?\"\"Yes. We have a man in place, a handler responsible for an American turncoat. He also oversees the Black Judas people from a discreet distance. Since they became model U.S. citizens, they have kept up with technology advances and are highly proficient with all forms of computer skills. Probably to such a degree they could walk into any IT environment and make the staff look like kindergarten underachievers.\"\"And once this project is activated,\" Bella persisted, \"what doweachieve?\"\"Hopefully great things as far as we are concerned— crippling and widespread breakdowns within the U.S. financial world, meltdown of their administrative databases. For example, their welfare program would crash. Cash benefits that are paid to applicants would vanish. Bank accounts would disappear from computer systems. Even federal accounts would be affected. On Wall Street a virus would engage and spread throughout the entire system, wiping out transactions and losing monies and stock details.\"Our programmers have been upgrading and inserting current data into the Black Judas core for months. Even as we speak they are feeding in even more information, all collected via our own systems, which are extremely versatile. Our team is constantly checking American systems, preparing the way for the day we give the go-ahead. They are permanently monitoring the safeguards and backups that the American institutions maintain to protect their financial world. Taken to the next level, we could conceivably hack into their utility companies and put them out of action. We could turn off America's lights and plunge it into darkness.\"\"How soon will Black Judas become active?\"\"Within the next few weeks,\" Krushen said. \"Final protocols are being written as we speak. Once these have been fed into the core, the project will become viable. Within days of the activation codes being sent out, Black Judas will go online.\"What Krushen did not relay to the committee was the information that had reached him from America that there was some kind of operation taking place aimed at dislodging the sleepers. He had the feeling it had something to do with Karl Federov, but until he could prove it he preferred to keep the details to himself. There were incidents that had taken place that concerned Krushen because they involved Black Judas. He had used his power and influence to keep them under wraps, not wanting to alarm anyone. Some members of the committee might panic if they were brought into the picture. Krushen found it easier to simply deal with the matters and say nothing to anyone who did not need to know.Karl Federov stood at the window, his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his thick overcoat. The concrete apron was awash with rain, a chill wind blowing it in rippling waves across the area. The airstrip had once been a Russian airforce base. It had been home to a squadron of SU-27 fighter planes, each armed with a GSh-30-1 cannon and carrying AA R27 missiles. This base had been one of many that encircled Moscow. Now, like many others, it had been closed because of rising costs and military cutbacks. All, Federov thought with some bitterness, in the name of democracy and freedom. He almost laughed out loud at the falsity of the words.Freedom.Democracy.That foolishness was responsible for the breakup of the Soviet Empire and the emasculating of its powerful military might. The Russia he once knew had become another nation ruled by greed and hypocrisy and all the depravity that could grip a nation. Looking deeper, he could see that little had really changed within the isolated corridors of power. Those in control became stronger and increasi...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Before the advent of the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS), a particular printer needed a driver for, say, System V Unix, and a separate driver for FreeBSD. The problem has become particularly pronounced now that Linux is becoming more popular as a desktop operating system, where it competes with Windows and other operating systems under which printer installation is pretty easy. CUPS installs on all major Unix and Linux flavors, and handles the interface between printer and operating system. Driver writers can, therefore, write for CUPS and not worry about what's underneath.CUPS: Common Unix Printing Systemis first on the scene with CUPS documentation for installers, administrators, users, and programmers. It represents good work and is a worthwhile guide and reference that goes beyond freely available online documentation.Some readers may be disappointed that certain procedural parts of this book--notably that which has to do with compiling CUPS into the Unix kernel from source code--are exclusively Linux based. You can extrapolate other Unix flavors' procedures from the Unix instructions, but explicit how-to information would be nice. However, explanatory information on the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP, on which CUPS is based) is nicely written, and the CUPS documentation itself--particularly the instructions for developing printer drivers (in C) is excellent. Read this if you want to develop printer drivers for what's likely to become a standard on consumer Linux distributions.--David WallTopics covered:The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) and the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) that underlies it. Though CUPS installation and its user interface are covered, the real value of this book is in the author's picking apart of IPP transactions and the CUPS API for programmers writing printer drivers. The drivers section devotes special attention to HP PCL and PostScript document handling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the best, sanest, and most comprehensive evaluation and critique of the American way of law that I have seen. Every serious scholar concerned with justice and efficiency, and every policymaker who is serious about improving the American legal order should read this trenchant and exciting book. (Lawrence Friedman, Stanford University)Kagan offers an important and insightful study of American legal culture. Its chief thesis is that the American way of law is best described as \"adversarial legalism,\" or the process by which policy making, implementation, and dispute resolution are dominated by lawyers and litigation. Although the thesis in this form is hardly original, Kagan's treatment of it, ranging across a wide variety of scholarly disciplines, is both comprehensive and critical. A significant advantage of Kagan's treatment is his commitment to a genuinely comparative analysis of American legalism, though one might argue that his assessment of American legal exceptionalism is overstated. Whatever the merits of Kagan's assessment, however, it is made possible by his careful attention to comparative materials and thus shows the promise of an authentic comparative legal methodology. In sum, this is an important, indeed an elegant, book. Highly recommended. (J. E. FinnChoice2002-03-01)[This] book is atour de force. It is an elegantly written, consistently insightful analysis and critique of the American emphasis on litigation and punitive sanctions in the policy and administrative process...Adversarial Legalismis in many ways a breath of fresh air. Political elites, scholars, and college students alike may find much that is new and surprising in this book--and it is Kagan's key purpose to surprise and stimulate fresh thinking about the range of possibilities for addressing policy problems. His argument is equally critical of the Republican party's sympathy for underdog plaintiffs, and he is virtually unique among prominent legal voices in calling for more government, more bureaucratic discretion, and, at the same time, less opportunity for legal challenge to government and corporate policy. Kagan is also appropriately realistic in recognizing that his critique and reform proposals are greatly out of step with reigning cultural patterns of populist distrust of governmental and corporate power and faith in self-help legal activism, and thus that his proposals are unlikely to succeed in the near future.

While the NCLEX may seem daunting now, it is simply a long review of what you have already learned. You have made it through the hardest part; now, you have just one mile left on the journey. This book is your guide for that last leg. Just as the Sherpas the native experts guide mountaineers in the Himalayas, Author J. Lucy Boyd is your NCLEX Sherpa, and 101 Ways to Score Higher on Your NCLEX is your compass. I wish a book like this was available when I took the NCLEX many years ago. Boyd avoids the trap many review books fall into and does not try to reteach nursing school. Instead, she walks you through how the test is designed, what to expect from the questions, and just as important what to expect from the actual mechanics of taking the computer-based test. You will discover that the NCLEX is not shrouded in mystery. By carefully reading this book, you will learn what the NCLEX is really testing for, how to approach the each type of question, and how to minimize mistakes while you are taking the exam. Be sure to pay special attention to the Smart Strategies throughout the book. These tips and hints make this book particularly valuable. They will help you focus on the key aspects of the information and will keep you from being bogged down with details that are not as important something that can really eat up your review time. I have been an item writer for the National Council for State Boards of Nursing and for professional specialty certification exams. In fact, I took a course in test construction. NCLEX questions follow very specific rules and are extensively tested before they are used to assess your knowledge. In fact, you will test new questions when you take the exam. While you will not know which ones they are, new questions will be part of your exam. The test creators carefully review each sample question s results before it becomes part of the official exam. Answers that seem clear to item writers and reviewers may not be clear to new nurses taking the boards, so the questions are modified or thrown out. You can be assured that there are not any gotcha questions waiting for you. The sample tests in this book will allow you to practice questions that follow the NCLEX format. The size of this book is ideal for carrying it with you to study on breaks or when you find yourself with time to kill. Get out your highlighter and a pen, mark it up, fold over the pages, and make it your personal study guide. Use the checklists and timelines to stay on track. I will never forget how excited I was when I tore open the envelope that told me I passed the NCLEX so many years ago. Earning your nursing license is the first step on a new journey. For me, that journey has led through critical care, medical-surgical and emergency nursing, home care, consulting, teaching, being an award-winning medical writer and health columnist for the New York Daily News, and being a repeat guest on The View. Your future is limited only by your imagination.

In this utterly absorbing, carefully reasoned inquiry into the profound relationship between two painters, one reviled, the other worshiped, Adams reclaims the wrongfully maligned Thomas Hart Benton and recalibrates our perception of Jackson Pollock and his masterpieces. Benton hid his true cultured self behind the mask of a “semi-literate hillbilly,” just as his “technical virtuosity” is concealed within his controversial murals. An exemplary teacher as well as a trailblazing artist, Benton was mentor and father figure to Pollock. “It is no exaggeration,” writes Adams, “to say that Benton created Pollock as an artist.” Adams cracks the secret of Benton’s “rhythmic flow” approach to composition, tracing its roots to the forgotten synchromism movement and its colorful creators. Adams then offers arresting insights into Pollock’s life and work, from his utter dependence on Benton and problematic adoration for Benton’s wife to the harrowing consequences of his bipolar disorder and his complex inspirations, from Jungian analysis to Asian mysticism. Encompassing a stunning discovery by his art-historian wife, Adams’ commanding, corrective double portrait reveals myriad camouflaged truths. --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ned, an architect, offers to strip Libby's fireplace, and soon he is chipping away at Libby's cool exterior as well as the layers of enamel that coat the marble mantle. This novel's strength lies in its realistic characters. Arnold doesn't ignore the difficulties of dating as a single parent; Libby and Ned put their children first, even when it threatens their own relationship.

He challenges conventional triumphalism, demonstrating comprehensively that despite Vicksburg and Gettysburg, by 1863 Northern citizens and soldiers were increasingly and openly wondering whether preserving the union and ending slavery were worth the cost of Mr. Lincoln's war. Disillusion and war-weariness had set in: the war's only fruits seemed to be moral and political degradation, dangerous constitutional precedents, tens of thousands dead and maimed. The Battle of Chickamauga appeared to have restored the stalemate. Marvel particularly conveys the looming crisis of the impending expiration of the three-year enlistments that were the Union army's norm. That, combined with the increasing reluctance of Northern men to volunteer or send their sons, could have ended the war by default. Romance and adventure or misery and peril—which emotions would prevail? As Marvel conclusively demonstrates, the coin remained in the air as 1863 came to an end. 32 b&w photos, 6 maps.(June 22)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sherman focuses on interviews with 40 soldiers—from the Vietnam era through the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—at various points in their military careers and expands her examination to the impact of war on the families of soldiers. Referring to philosophers from Aristotle to Seneca to Epictetus, she explores the moral dilemma of justifying killing in war, struggles with the morality of some wars, the political obfuscation for war, denigration of the enemy, torture of prisoners, the morality of interrogators, and the worries of being held prisoner. On a broader level, Sherman explores the practical need to compartmentalize military and civilian life but the moral need not to compartmentalize so much that humanity is lost. Sherman, who has worked with the military on trauma and ethics issues, offers penetrating portraits of the individual struggles of soldiers and profound insights on aspects of war that civilians rarely consider. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She yanked it open.'Look, I'm—' Her sentence went unfinished, her voice suspended by shock as she stared at the man standing on the doorstep.Shock, disbelief, fear, anger, panic, and a sharp spear of something else that she didn't recognise exploded inside her like a fireball, with such powerful intensity that her body was drained of so much energy that she was left feeling shaky and weak, trembling inwardly beneath the onslaught of emotions.Of course hewouldbe dressed immaculately, in a dark business suit worn over a crisp blue shirt, whilst she was wearing her old jeans and a baggy tee shirt. Not that it really mattered how she looked. After all, she had no reason to want to impress him—had she? And she certainly had no reason to want him to think of her as a desirable woman, groomed and dressed for his approval. She had to clench her stomach muscles against the shudder of revulsion that threatened to betray her. The face that had haunted her dreams and then her nightmares hadn't changed—or aged. If anything he looked even more devastatingly handsome and virile than she had remembered, the dark gold gaze that had mesmerised her so effectively every bit as compelling now as it had been then. Or was it because she was a woman now and not the girl she had been that she was so immediately and shockingly aware of what a very sexual man he was? Ruby didn't know, and she didn'twantto know.The disbelief that had frozen her into silence had turned like snow in the sun to a dangerous slush of fear and horror inside her head—and her heart?No!Whatever effect he had once had on her heart, Sander Konstantinakos had no power to touch it now.But still the small betraying word, 'You,' slid from the fullness of the naturally warm-coloured lips that had caused her parents to name her Ruby, causing a look of mixed contempt and arrogance to flash from the intense gold of Sander's eyes. Eyes the colour of the king of the jungle—as befitted a man who was in effect the ruler of the Mediterranean island that was his home.Instinctively Ruby started to close the door on him, wanting to shut out not just Sander himself but everything he represented, but he was too quick for her, taking hold of the door and forcing it open so that he could step into the hall—and then close the door behind him, enclosing them both in the small domestic space, with its smell of cleaning fluid. Strong as it was, it still wasn't strong enough to protect her from the scent ofhim. Arash of prickly sensation raised the hairs at the back of her neck and then ran down her spine. This was ridiculous. Sander meant nothing to her now, just as she had meant nothing to him that night… But she mustn't think about that. She must concentrate instead on what she was now, not what she had been then, and she must remember the promise she had made to the twins when they had been born—she would put the past behind her.What she had never expected was that that past would seek her out, and now it had…'What are you doing here?' she demanded, determined to wrest control of the situation from Sander. 'What do you want?'His mouth might be aesthetically perfect, with that well-cut top lip balancing the promise of sensuality with his fuller bottom lip, but there was nothing sensual about the tight-lipped look he was giving her, and his words were as sharply cold as the air outside the Manchester hotel in which he had abandoned her that winter morning.'I think you know the answer to that,' he said, his English as fluent and as accentless as she remembered. 'What I want, what I have come for and what I mean to have, are my sons.''Yoursons?' Fiercely proud of her twin sons, and equally fiercely maternally protective of them, there was nothing he could have said which would have been more guaranteed to arouse Ruby's anger than his verbal claim on them. Angry colour burned in the smooth perfection of Ruby's normally calm face, and her blue-green eyes were fiery with the fierce passion of her emotions.It was over six years since this man had taken her, used her and then abandoned her as casually as though she was a…a nothing. A cheap, impulsively bought garment which in the light of day he had discarded for its cheapness. Oh, yes, she knew that she had only herself to blame for what had happened to her that fatal night.Shehad been the one to flirt with him, even if that flirtation had been alcohol-induced, and no matter how she tried to excuse her behaviour it still shamed her. But not its result—not her beautiful, adorable, much loved sons. They could never shame her, and from the moment they had been born she had been determined to be a mother of whom they could be proud—a mother with whom they could feel secure, and a mother who, no matter how much she regretted the manner in which they had been conceived, would not for one minute even want to go back in time and avoid their conception. Her sons were her life.Hersons.'My sons—' she began, only to be interrupted.'Mysons, you mean—since in my country it is the father who has the right to claim his children, not the mother.''My sons were not fathered by you,' Ruby continued firmly and of course untruthfully.'Liar,' Sander countered, reaching inside his jacket to produce a photograph which he held up in front of her.The blood left Ruby's face. The photograph had been taken at Manchester Airport, when they had all gone to see her middle sister off on her recent flight to Italy, and the resemblance of the twins to the man who had fathered them was cruelly and undeniably revealed. The two boys were cast perfectly in their father's image, right down to the unintentionally arrogant masculine air they could adopt at times, as though deep down somewhere in their genes there was an awareness of the man who had fathered them.Watching the colour come and go in Ruby's face, Sander allowed himself to give her a triumphant look. Ofcoursethe boys were his. He had known it the first second he had looked at the image on his sister's mobile phone. Their mirror image resemblance to him had sent a jolt of emotion through him unlike anything he had previously experienced.It hadn't taken the private agency he had contacted very long to trace Ruby—although Sander had frowned over comments in the report he had received from them that implied that Ruby was a devoted mother who dedicated herself to raising her sons and was unlikely to give them up willingly. But Sander had decided that Ruby's very devotion to his sons might be the best tool he could use to ensure that she gave them up to him.'My sons' place is with me, on the island that is their home and which ultimately will be their inheritance. Under our laws they belong to me.''Belong? They are children, not possessions, and no court in this country would let you take them from me.'She was beginning to panic, but she was determined not to let him see it.'You think not? You are living in a house that belongs to your sister, on which she has a mortgage she can no longer afford to repay, you have no money of your own, no job. No training—nothing! I, on the other hand, can provide my sons with everything that you cannot—a home, a good education, a future.'Although she was shaken by the knowledge of how thoroughly he had done his homework, had had her investigated, Ruby was still determined to hold her ground and not allow him to overwhelm her.'Maybe so. But can you provide them with love and the knowledge that they are truly loved and wanted? Of course you can't—because you don't love them. How can you? You don't know them.'There—let him answerthat!But even as she made her defiant stand Ruby's heart was warning her that Sander had raised an issue that she could not ignore and would ultimately have to face. Honesty compelled her to admit it.'I do know that one day they will want to know who fathered them and what their family history is,' she said.It was hard for her to make that admission—just as it had been hard for her to answer the questions the boys had already asked, saying that they did have a daddy but he lived in a different country. Those words had reminded her of what she was denying her sons because of the circumstances in which she had conceived them. One day, though, their questions would be those of teenagers, not little boys, and far more searching, far more knowing.Ruby looked away from Sander, instinctively wanting to hide her inner fears from him. The problem of telling the boys how she had come to have them lay across her heart and her conscience in an ever present heavy weight. At the moment they simply accepted that, like many of the other children they were at school with, they did not have a daddy living with them. But one day they would start to ask more questions, and she had hoped desperately that she would not have to tell them the truth until they were old enough to accept it without judging her. Now Sander had stirred up all the anxieties she had tried to put to one side. More than anything else she wanted to be a good mother, to give her boys the gift of a secure childhood filled with love; she wanted them to grow up knowing they were loved, confident and happy, without the burden of having to worry about adult relationships. For that reason she wa...", "related": ["B00186Z0XW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two months premature, it immediately became apparent that Eric was in a hurry - a state in which he remains to this day. A great deal of his childhood and early adulthood were spent in Macedon, NY. While living there, he often dreamed of making movies. During high school, he discovered that what he really wanted to do was write. The Belgariad by David Eddings is directly to blame.  His first novel - a pulpy fantasy novel entitled The Dark Spires - was written soon after Eric finished his junior year in high school. Alas, The Dark Spires, coauthored by Eric with a childhood friend, was not destined to see the light of day. It now molders in the corner of an attic somewhere... either in Macedon, NY - home of Eric’s parents - or in California, current home of Eric’s previously mentioned childhood friend.  Eventually, Eric went to college in Albany, NY. During his stint there - majoring in English and Philosophy - Eric wrote The Shadow of the Crimson Queen - a short story - and began writing his sophomore novel, a tale entitled Revenant. The Shadow of the Crimson Queen can now be found online. Alas Revenant remains, as yet, unfinished... not to say that it will stay that way forever.  Immediately after viewing The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Eric decided to hunker down and get serious about his own writing again. Heavily influenced at that time by Clive Barker’s Books of Blood, David Eddings’ The Belgariad, and Peter Jackson’s vision of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, he began the The Hands of Aldulan Trilogy that year. The trilogy was completed in 2007.  Currently, Eric is writing short stories, outlining his next series, and working on various audio projects.  He lives in Rochester, NY with his family.", "related": [], "rank": 4658829, "title": "Devolve", "author": "Eric A.

A chance assignment to cover the World Cup gave the lifelong soccer fan a passion for attending big, international tournaments in person. In recounting three World Cups (2002, 2006, and 2010) and two Euros (2004 and 2008), he focuses less on the field and more on what happens beyond the camera’s eye, from raging parties in the streets to quiet encounters between fans. He has a knack for choosing telling details, and in chronicling the crowds, context, and spectacle of these mammoth competitions, he makes a strong case for them as “joy-bringers, unique festivals of congeniality.” The narrative suffers from a minor case of the I-could-have-told-you-so syndrome; if we are to believe Doyle, he generally knew more about what would happen, and what it meant, than other observers. And, for all his love of revelry, he tends to pass judgment on whether others are enjoying themselves in the right way. Those quibbles aside, Doyle’s enthusiasm is infectious. And his book, packed with memorable scenes, should encourage even the most casual fan to take the fun of it all more seriously. --Keir Graff", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Snowwas born in Leicester, on 15 October 1905. He was educated from age 11 at Alderman Newton's School for boys where he excelled in most subjects, enjoying a reputation for an astounding memory. In 1923, he gained an external scholarship in science at London University, whilst working as a laboratory assistant at Newton's to gain the necessary practical experience, because Leicester University, as it was to become, had no chemistry or physics departments at that time.Having achieved a first class degree, followed by a Master of Science he won a studentship in 1928 which he used to research at the famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Snow went on to become a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1930 where he also served as a tutor, but his position became increasingly titular as he branched into other areas of activity.  In 1934, he began to publish scientific articles in 'Nature', and then 'The Spectator' before becoming editor of the journal 'Discovery' in 1937.He was also writing fiction during this period and in 1940 'Strangers and Brothers' was published. This was the first of eleven novels in the series and was later renamed 'George Passant' when 'Strangers and Brothers' was used to denote the series itself. 'Discovery' became a casualty of the war, closing in 1940. However, by this time Snow was already involved with the Royal Society, who had organised a group to specifically use British scientific talent operating under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour. He served as the Ministry's technical director from 1940 to 1944.After the war, he became a civil service commissioner responsible for recruiting scientists to work for the government and also returned to writing, continuing the 'Strangers and Brothers' novels.  'The Light and the Dark' was published in 1947, followed by 'Time of Hope' in 1949, and perhaps the most famous and popular of them all, 'The Masters', in 1951. He planned to finish the cycle within five years, but the final novel 'Last Things' wasn't published until 1970.C.P. Snow married the novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1950 and they had one son, Philip, in 1952.  He was knighted in 1957 and became a life peer in 1964, taking the title Baron Snow of the City Leicester.  He also joined Harold Wilson's first government as Parliamentary Secretary to the new Minister of Technology. When the department ceased to exist in 1966 he became a vociferous back-bencher in the House of Lords.After finishing the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, Snow continued writing both fiction and non-fiction. His last work of fiction was 'A Coat of Vanish', published in 1978. His non-fiction included a short life of Trollope published in 1974 and another, published posthumously in 1981, 'The Physicists: a Generation that Changed the World'. He was also inundated with lecturing requests and offers of honorary doctorates. In 1961, he became Rector of St. Andrews University and for ten years also wrote influential weekly reviews for the 'Financial Times'.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Educated by Jesuits, he was an excellent pupil but one quickly enraged by dogma. An early rift with his father—who wished him to study law—led to his choice of letters as a career. Insinuating himself into court circles, he became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille.By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, ofLettres philosophiques sur les Anglais(1733)—an attack on French Church and State—forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived chiefly away from Paris. In this, his most prolific period, he wrote such satirical tales as “Zadig” (1747) and “Candide” (1759). His old age at Ferney, outside Geneva, was made bright by his adopted daughter, “Belle et Bonne,” and marked by his intercessions in behalf of victims of political injustice. Sharp-witted and lean in his white wig, impatient with all appropriate rituals, he died in Paris in 1778—the foremost French author of his day.Theo Cuffe translated Voltaire’sMicromégasand Other Short Fictionsfor Penguin Classics </div>", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.0833, "rating_total": 49.0}

Indeed the prolific writer has demonstrated an enviable versatility in her witty fictional works and journalistic forays. Yet at her best, her voice is far from prosaic, conveying the distilled, sympathetic wisdom of the unfaltering observer. That characteristic pervades her treasurably evocative, literary travel memoirSicilian Odyssey--part of the ongoingNational Geographic Directions Series. A few months after the trauma of 9-11, Prose embarked with her husband on a trip to Sicily \"partly to discover what this island has learned and can teach us about the triumph of beauty over violence, of life over death.\"  She colorfully invokes the profuse legends and myths linked with  Sicily (Homer’s \"Island of the Sun\" where Odysseus washed ashore) as a classical backdrop to her own odyssey, which at times in fact assumes the character of a trip back to a timeless, pre-modern way of life.Prose is especially effective at threading into her narrative fascinating items of reference—artistic, historical, and sociopolitical—without appearing didactic. She packs an extraordinary amount of information into her account: art historical observations (including a trenchant interpretation of Caravaggio’s disturbing \"The Burial of St. Lucy\"), the spectacle of religious ecstatics, accounts of culinary traditions, political intrigue, and memorable character sketches of people engaged in everyday habits, with the novelist’s touch for the telling detail. Throughout, Prose is keen to capture Sicily’s vacillating moods—its cheerful colors as well as its melancholy strain—as a place that \"has seen countless cycles of violence and peace, of poverty and prosperity, of horror and beauty\"—and yet embodies humanity’s will to survive. As the ultimate travel guide, her prose conveys the sights, sounds, smells, and sense of the place with vicarious finesse.--Thomas May", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

God has comforted and reassured Matt many times with the following Scripture: \"And He said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness' Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me\" (2 Corinthians 12:9).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being first and foremost a mystery writer that\noften places his stories in the time period of the 1800's this was new\nterritory for me. Having previously\nbuilt up a reputation for mystery novels that were realistic, I found afterA Transgression In Timecame out, that\nsome of my long-time readers disowned me!But slowly they came back, and hopefully, I am now back in their good\ngraces.        However, there is one that has refused to even except my\nletters and Christmas cards since he discovered thatA Transgression In Timehad a science fiction aspect to it. This\nhurt me deeply, as I have a lot of respect for his opinion when it comes to classic\nWesterns. The fact that he lives in one of the most famous Western towns, that\nis truly still the west of the 1800's, made it hurt even deeper. That be as it\nmay, most of the feedback I get is one of approval.        A Transgression In\nTime, is quite a large book going some 603 pages, so if the reader buys the\nKindle edition, they get more than their money's worth.        HowA Transgression In\nTimecame to be I no longer remember, as it was several novels ago, and I\ntry to make it a point not to dwell on any of my past books, as I promised\nmyself years ago that I would not fall into the trap that many writers do,\nwhere all of their books are basically the same, just the character's names and\nplaces have been changed to make it easier to write. Much as today's Romance writers\ndo.       This is not to say that it is wrong in doing so, as many of\nthese writers have enjoyed great success in their endeavors. But, after\nspending many years writing nonfiction books, and reading very few works of fiction, other than when I was a child and read a series of Jules Verne's tomes, along with one by author Kenneth Grahame, by the name ofThe Wind in the Willowswhich along with Jules Verne instilled in my heart a sense of adventure, I found myself reading a\nnovel by a very famous author, that had been given to me by a close friend. In\nfact, he not only gave me one novel, but several by the same author, and after\nreading them I realized that they were all basically the same!        There were other inconsistencies in the books as well, that to me\nwas inconceivable that an author of his stature would make. At this time, I made\na huge mistake in telling my wife about the irregularities. Another colossal\nmistake I made, was offhandedly saying to my wife, \"I could do better than that!\" At the time\nI didn't realize that I had just placed a curse upon my head, when she said, \"Then do it!\" That day,Madiganwas\nborn!        I have tried in my writing to be believable and accurate.\nAnd I think you, the reader, will be more than pleasantly surprised at the\nresults. My protagonist (good guys and women) are human, making the same\nmistakes, feeling the same things, that every human can relate to. And they cannot\nbe shot full of holes, and still carry on in the pursuit of the antagonist (bad\nguys) as though nothing serious has happened to them! A Transgression In Timeis the exception only in the dual time\nperiods of the book's story. R.Howard\nTrembly", "related": [], "rank": 2274635, "title": "A Transgression in Time", "author": "R.

The story is rife with all the trappings of a time of story-tellers, traveling bards, Vikings and native peoples who wandered the earth, a time before printing presses and cell phones. In exciting fashion author Ellen Kuhfeld suggests the possibility of a westward penetration into the new continent long before Columbus, before the Spaniards or the Portuguese came to the new world. Never mind there is scant reliable evidence of Finns or Norse or white Christians ever penetrating to the middle of North America before the sixteenth century. Be that as it may, had they come, here s an enthralling story of how it might have been. --Carl BrookinsBefore forensics, the truth had to be found through determination. Secret Murder is an alternative historical novel, set in a world where the Europeans settled North America much sooner than 1492. When murder is afoot in a Minnesota trading outpost, Ellen Kuhfeld blends this unique world into a fascinating read that will prove hard to put down. Secret Murder is an excellent pick for both historical fiction and fantasy collections, very much recommended reading. --Midwest Book ReviewI thoroughly enjoyed this book. It s a murder mystery set in an outpost of medieval Europe, which just happens to be in Minnesota. (In the novel s world, Europeans settled in North America long before 1492 and now trade through the Great Lakes and along the Mississippi, both with Native Americans and other settlers.) An overbearing Viking is murdered at a trade fair, where Scandinavian merchants from Northern Minnesota meet to trade with English and French merchants from farther south. The chief suspect is an old enemy of the Viking, a tough as nails and likable merchant named Ragnar Forkbeard. The bailiff for the local baron is trying to solve the crime, before the fair breaks up and the killer can get away. Ragnar is trying to solve the crime, before he is arrested for it. In the course of the two investigations, we are introduced to medieval trading, religion, courtship, friendship, poetry and ethics. I could not find a false note anywhere. Kuhfeld s Vikings ring true. Like the saga heroes, they are tough, honorable, violent and funny. His English characters are equally interesting and plausible. I enjoyed the midwestern landscape and trying to identify the locations I know now. (Milltown by the Great Falls has to be Minneapolis by St. Anthony Falls. Lakesend has to be Duluth.) The mystery kept me guessing. Its solution was satisfactory. There are two Viking funerals, one of them outstanding, and a quiet romance. What else can a reasonable person ask for? I recommend the book to anyone who is interested in Vikings, medieval Europe or a good, old fashioned, Minnesota murder mystery. --Eleanor Arnason", "related": ["B009DI21OI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 44.0}

Recently, I had a chance to\n review Younger Next Decade by Dr. Barbara Ebel.In her book, Dr.\n Ebel focuses on lifestyle changes that can make a big difference in\nthwarting the effects of aging. Much of her material focuses on how age\nalters our bodies, with an emphasis on life after fifty. She does a good\n job of communicating medical information in layman's terms, and she\nmakes good points about why people should abandon unhealthy habits\nbefore they cause irreversible harm.Her chapters focus not only\non aspects of physical health, like diet, exercise, and the dangers of\nsmoking, but also on the importance of mental and spiritual health. At\nthe end of each chapter, she makes practical suggestions on how one can\nmake simple adjustments to start down the path of healthier living. Her\ntone is cheerful and encouraging - sort of like a motivational speaker -\n and mostly avoids finger wagging.I believe the book is a good\nresource for a person who is nearing that fiftieth birthday and\nwondering how to start a healthier living plan.

[Diabetes] contributes to our understanding of the ways in which disease and its treatment are linked fundamentally to social and scientific history, and the ways in which biographies can shed new light on some very old diseases.\"--Chemical Heritage\"In this remarkably succinct, comparative, and engaging book, Tattersall offers a comprehensive and thorough history that reveals many of the nuances of this disease and treatments for it. An important contribution to the history of medicine, it should be read by all interested in the history of chronic illness, and the history of diabetes in particular.\"--Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences\"Highly recommended. This elegantly written small book is packed with historial facts and fascinating historical case studies. A useful acquisition for libraries, particularly those in colleges, universities, and medical schools.\"--ChoiceListed inScience Book News\"If you are just beginning a career in diabetes research or care, this book will provide you with the important back-story of the major advances in the field that have preceded you. If you are already well-established in the field, the book will consolidate memories and clarify facts surrounding the \"urban legends\" that abound in diabetes circles. And if you are simply someone who likes a good story about how the present came to be, the book will provide you with a good read about one of the most important human afflictions today and for the foreseeable future. If you place yourself in one of these groups, I strongly recommend the book to you.\"--American Journal of Epidemiology\"This is dark stuff, but fascinating stuff. These four biographies of diseases go far beyond questions of biology or medical practice; they talk politics, sex and class, faith, how to plan a healthy world and how to be a proper woman or a proper man. Strangest and most fascinating of all is the way you keep glimpsing whole societies reflected in the surgery, from the drinking water to the high philosophy.\"--Scotsman.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ashley has been dealing with the spirit world all her life, but has always kept her secret close to her heart. But then she meets a ghost named Sara, who desperately wants Ashley's help. Ashley decides to help the troubled spirit, going on a quest to find a particular house, and more importantly, the man who owns it. But Ashley isn't prepared for the fluttering of her heart when she meets Nathaniel Marshall, the owner of the magnificent home. Nor is Ashley prepared for the battle of wills to come. As Nathaniel begins to trust her, Ashley finds herself falling fast for the charming architect. But danger is lurking ever so closely as a crazed fan begins to stalk his favorite author, testing Ashley and Nathaniel's new found love.This charming love story was a delight to read. From the first page, I was hooked. Ashley Dawson drew me in with her spiritual connections and her stubborn quest to help Nathaniel find peace after losing his wife in such a tragic fashion. The writing flowed smoothly chapter after chapter. Nathaniel was equally captivating - a true lady's man. And of course, the delightful Sarah was ever so kind to share her wonderful husband. Aris Whittier has written a captivating tale. \"Secrets\" has just the right amount of ingredients - romance, paranormal and a dash of thrill - all equaling a delicious read! I look forward to reading more novels by this talented author.", "related": [], "rank": 1573999, "title": "Secrets (Romantic Suspense)", "author": "Aris Whittier", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 3.9412, "rating_total": 67.0}

He rigorously analyzes the complex Victorian (1860-80) debates surrounding the idea of spontaneous generation...He also emphasizes the social aspects and personal interests that influenced those arguments offered by both naturalists and physicians. The result of prodigious research,Sparks of Lifeis highly recommended. (H. James BirxLibrary Journal)Between 1860 and 1880, the scientific community vigorously debated the doctrine of spontaneous generation...and it held sway for generations before being challenged in the era of Darwin's theory of evolution. Strick investigates the evidence brought to bear on this controversy, including improvements in microscope technology, laboratory techniques, and experimental method, all of which helped author germ theory. Strick also treats conceptual changes and public controversy that lay beneath the research and scientific advances of Darwin's era. (Science News2000-12-02)[Strick] explores the debate in Victorian Britain (1860-80) over the view that life was formed from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation or abiogenesis), against the background of controversy generated by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and development of the germ theory of disease...The author strives to connect...diverse issues, making the work...attractive to those well versed in the scientific and historical details. (J.S. SchwartzChoice2001-04-01)Sparks of Lifeprovides a fascinating, scholarly account of the 19th century spontaneous generation controversy that raged in England which focuses on the work of Henry Charlton Bastian...Strick's highly readable account of English microbiology during the late Victorian period is superb and unlikely to be bettered--a must for everyone interested in the development of both microbiology and biology in general. (Milton WainwrightMicrobiology Today2001-08-01)In accessible language and an engaging narrative style, Strick navigates through the Victorian power politics of both observational and experimental science (Darwin's immediate 19th-century legacy) and the old (and inevitable) rifts between men of science and arrogant medical practitioners. He illuminates especially the European backdrop and the relations of the debates over spontaneous generation to the \"big questions.\" (Lynn MargulisScience2001-02-09)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Count me as one of them. He\nknows what makes a story tick. He knows the value of character. And he knows\nhow to scare you.

It analyzes the changing patterns of world population growth, including the effects of migration, war, disease, technology and culture. Its core purpose in explaining the links between nature, culture and demography is to encourage humanity's search for ways to prevent future demographic catastrophes brought about by environmental or human agency. Valued for its informative and accessible style as well as its fresh treatment of contemporary theory, it covers issues that are crucial to the future of every species, human and animal.For this fifth edition the author has updated the statistical and bibliographical information and revises his central themes in the light of significant recent scholarship. Areas of note include coverage of the declining birthrates of developing countries in Asia and Latin America, as well as updated sections on the demographic impact of HIV-AIDS and international migration. There is also fuller discussion of the effects of environmental and climate change on population trends.", "related": [], "rank": 1391494, "title": "A Concise History of World Population", "author": "Massimo Livi Bacci", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lola and Evie Lawless are the two young daughters of Ezra, a policeman whose tendency toward violence and belligerence isn’t confined to the workplace. One day, under circumstances that remain cloudy for years, Ezra dies, and Lola and Evie rejoice at the thought that they are free from his tyranny (even as their mother is convicted of his murder). However, they haven’t reckoned on their father’s brother, Seth, whose own foulness makes their father’s look positively harmless. And as the two girls struggle to live ordinary lives, they are reminded at every turn that Seth isn’t a man who will let Ezra’s death go unpunished. This has all the makings of an overwritten, overwrought thriller, but McCoy keeps a tight rein on his characters and his story, never letting them drift into B-movie melodrama, as so many revenge stories are wont to do. A solid thriller. --David Pitt", "related": ["B004BA5GMC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He ran, sometimes alone, sometimes with other refugees, for the next 10 years, making his way from the DRC, through Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa before making his way back to Zimbabwe a trip that totaled nearly 2,600 miles. He was identified as a candidate for relocation in Zimbabwe and was sent to Boise, Idaho, the city he now calls home. Fidel encountered many untold horrors along the way and has found that poetry is his therapy. After 12 years assuming he was the only person in his family who made it out of the DRC alive, Fidel has miraculously found, first a brother and a sister, then his Mother and Father and 4 other siblings, all alive.

Do they know how to make, save, and invest their own money? These were concerns I had when I became the mother of 4 children. You see, I graduated from college with a BA in economics, worked as a teller, accountant, & credit analyst. But I learned the most about how to manage money from my parents. My dad grew up in foster homes from the age of 2, and even though he never graduated from high school, he still became a successful business owner. And my mom, grew up dirt poor and worked as a secretary for the fire department. Although my parents' combined annual income was less than $50,000, they still were able to retire at the young age of 52 and had over a million dollars net worth. And they taught me to do the same. I've been a stay at home/work from home mom for the past 15 years. You'll find all sorts of humorous, heart-warming stories about how I've taught my own 4 kids about money and the trials and tribulations. I wrote this book because I believe with all my heart that every child - no matter how much you have or don't have - can master money and become a millionaire. If my parents can do it - if I can do it - then my kids can do it.

ReadingMercy!, you will grasp why baseball, my favorite team sport, is so beloved.\"—George H. W. Bush“This is an extraordinary book, and for those of us who grew up with the Red Sox, starting back when Tom Yawkey bought the team, it is more than extraordinary. The Red Sox announcers were THE Voices of the team. We've had lots of books about the Red Sox. This one takes it a whole new level.”—Michael Dukakis“Firmly established as baseball broadcasting’s top historian and chronicler, Curt Smith has expertly researched and documented those of us entrusted to be the eyes and ears of Red Sox Nation. He beautifully captures the essence of being a Red Sox fan—and why Fenway Park is ‘America’s Most Beloved Ballpark.’”—Joe Castiglione, Radio Voice, Boston Red Sox“Mercy!is a grand evocation of the history of the Red Sox told through the voices that called and amplified the games for us from the broadcasting booth. Smith’s style – punchy and laden with wonderful quotations – is a perfect fit for this truly remarkable broadcast history.”—Paul Dickson, author ofBill Veeck: Baseball’s Greatest Maverick“Curt Smith is simply one of the best baseball historians ever. This is a must-read for any fan of the Olde Towne Team. Like my Cubs, the Red Sox play in an iconic park, have an immense fan base, and know legendary heartbreak. This book shows why, to some, baseball history is even more sublime than baseball present.”—Pat Hughes, Radio Voice, Chicago Cubs“Curt Smith displays an amazing awareness of why Sox mikemen are revered as electronic family members, enhancing baseball with their words, tones, and comments. His use of actual play-by-play to complement game action adds a powerful dimension. Terrific insight and research forge absolute can’t-put-down reading.”—Bob Wolff, America’s longest-running sportscaster“Curt Smith brings two great New England passions alive as only he can: history and Red Sox baseball on radio and television.Mercy!is a wonderful walk down memory lane with each, chronicling the Olde Towne Team’s legacy. An immensely artful and enjoyable book.”—Dave O’Brien, Radio Voice, Boston Red Sox“Esteemed author Curt Smith has homered again withMercy!– a poignant and humorous valentine to baseball’s most beloved park.

Lois Kulwicki, divorced mother of two and devotee of garage sales, struggles to gain independence from her selfish, seemingly oh-so-reasonable ex-husband Willy, in whose house she still lives a year after their divorce. Gail, their teenage daughter, worried that she is pregnant, sees herself as the only sane person in a world of flaky adults. Finally thrown out by Willy, who's blithely remarrying, Lois and the girls rent a house and acquire an unwanted tenant: Henry Martin, a disoriented wreck ever since his girlfriend and her son were killed in a car accident. Lois is haunted by the memory of the father she hasn't seen in 25 years; her mother abandoned him after he lost his job at the Studebaker plant and went dotty. Is he still alive? The answer will involve a cross-country ride in a Studebaker, which serves as the unifying symbol of a bygone era when companies supposedly treated employees like family. Intimately familiar with America's Rust Belt, Hemley ( All You Can Eat ) draws a quirky, droll road map of the human heart, with all its foibles and dangers.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 920438, "title": "The Last Studebaker: A Novel (Break Away Books)", "author": "Robin Hemley", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As well as romantic novels, she wrote historical biographies, 6 autobiographies, theatrical plays and books of advice on life, love, vitamins and cookery. She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world. She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B. Dalton bestsellers list, a feat never achieved before or since by any author. Barbara Cartland became a legend in her own lifetime and will be best remembered for her wonderful romantic novels so loved by her millions of readers throughout the world, who have always collected her books to read again and again, especially when they feel miserable or depressed. Her books will always be treasured for their moral message, her pure and innocent heroines, her handsome and dashing heroes, her blissful happy endings and above all for her belief that the power of love is more important than anything else in everyone’s life.", "related": ["B00JDNI4QC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It all happened with this story, I wanted to write my own tale. I love Anime and Manga so much I just wanted to try writing a story. I thought long and hard about what subject to do and after a while I remembered how much I love Angels. Having went to Sunday school my whole life I knew the story of the War in Heaven and of Lucifer falling. After some more research I discovered about the Nephlim creatures. Children of Angel and Humans, I know now a days it is spelled Nephilim but it sounds weird saying it so I decided to spell it Nephlim. Also I saw it spelled that way a few years ago as well. Anyway I set about writing it and after 50 chapters and 2 years of writing it I set out to find an artist. Thanks to Freelanced I found one in Heather Matheny, an Alaskan girl who loves Anime and Manga. It took her around 8 months to pencil and ink the first Issue of Nephlim and since I was bored waiting I started writing other ideas. After the first Issue Heather decided to pursue other interests and I had to find a new artist. After some time and some hiccups I came to find Gerald Forton and Amazing artist who drew for the animation department on He- Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! I wanted Nephlim to be colored as well and through Freelanced I found Nicole Graham. She is by far one of the best Colorists I have ever seen and together we are taking Nephlim to new Heights.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Alfred studied at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago and thereafter carried on an itinerant Bible teaching and writing ministry, chiefly in the United States and Canada.  Gibbs published his first book, The Marvelous City of Mansoul in 1926. In all he wrote fourteen books and booklets, including Christian Baptism, The Lord s Supper, Scriptural Principles of Gathering, and Worship. All his books have intensity like the man who wrote them. He was full of his subject. He also composed poetry and wrote Christian hymns.  Gibbs never married, considering himself a eunuch for the kingdom of God. He was a model of the advice he gave, he was a spiritual man and a practical man, and fun to be with besides. For Gibbs, to hold forth the Word of life was a lifetime passion. This is evident in Gibbs helpful companion book, Through the Scriptures, which is a workbook of Bible outlines culled from Gibbs own preaching.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author is a postgraduate in English language and literature. He accepted Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior when he was a boy of 13.  This then was the message that he heard of the Son of God, Lord Jesus Christ.  This then is the message that he declares that God is light and in Lord Jesus there is no darkness at all. Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent from above to save sinners. Jesus died on the cross bearing our sins upon himself our sin and whosoever confesses his/he sin to Him shall not perish but will have everlasting life. This is the message that the author shares with others in order that they may know the truth. \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\" (John 14:6).  We are reconciled unto God through His blood that was shed upon the cross of Calvary. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\". John 14:6 \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\" Romans 3:23  Salvation is available freely for all who believe in Jesus Christ and confess his/her sins to Him. Today is the day of salvation. \"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me\" (1 Corinthians 15:10) Please visit http://www.lesliejohn.net/", "related": ["B0055EH536"], "rank": 1619219, "title": "The Tabernacle", "author": "Leslie John", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sadler lives on the West coast of Florida with his wife and son. Robert’s love of writing began when he was very young but wasn't truly realized until health issues forced him to retire from the medical industry at the age of thirty seven. His writing style mirrors his personality and in many ways his general beliefs about society as a whole. His passion for writing about good versus evil mixed with tons of violence and a touch of the erotic comes through loud and clear in his “Secrets Of Blood & Bone” Paranormal Fantasy series. He also enjoys writing about the darker side of human nature which you can get a taste of in his last release “VENGEANCE” as well as another stand alone title he has in the works called “Entitlement. All of Robert’s books contain his trademark sarcasm and twisted, dark sense of humor.

Angelina, who lives in Italy, is so enamored of pizza that her older sister calls her \"Patty Pizza.\" When one night at dinner her uncle tells the story of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the girl envisions \"a tower made of delicious, saucy pizza pies rising as tall as the church steeple down the street\" and is chagrined to think that, if it fell over, \"no one would ever have a chance to eat it! Especially her!\" When she fails to believe her mother's assertion that the tower is not made of pizza (\"Don't worry, darlinghissima,\" she tells Angelina), the family drives to Pisa. There—with \"big tears rolling down [her] cheeks\"—Angelina dashes past a guard and under the ropes to get a closer look at the structure. With relief, she discovers, \"There wasn't a piece of pepperoni or drippy mozzarella in sight!\" In the tale's predictably contrived ending, Angelina earns \"a great big pizza pie with everything!\" Though cheerful, Rockwell's spare illustrations are as one-dimensional as the narrative. Unfortunately, neither will satiate the appetites of youngsters hungry for information about a child from another culture.

Those wishing to trace the footsteps of the 'underestimated apostle' in early Christianity will find no better guide than Bockmuehl and no better exposition of why that journey of remembrance matters.\"--C. Clifton Black, Princeton Theological Seminary\"Bockmuehl has long distinguished himself as a careful historian, sensitive to both Jewish and Greco-Roman dimensions of the early Christian movement and an astute reader of literary texts. This well-written and ecumenically sensitive volume draws on all his impressive skills. New insights abound regarding the portrayal of Peter in the New Testament and in nonbiblical sources from the second century.\"--Gary Anderson, University of Notre Dame\"A valuable study that combines amazing breadth of coverage of evidence (textual, artistic, and archaeological), sensitive and cogent analysis, and thoughtful concluding reflections for Protestant and Catholic Christians today. Bockmuehl takes readers on an intriguing tour of early Christian traditions about Peter with full knowledge of scholarly studies and also an appropriate exercise of his own judgment. The results are fascinating and 'must' reading for anyone seriously interested in early Christianity and its aftermath.\"--Larry Hurtado, University of Edinburgh\"Not since Cullmann in 1952 has there been such a thorough examination of the biblical information on Peter. The whole work is inspired by a heart that beats for truth, for ecumenical understanding, and for reconciliation.\"--Benedict T. Viviano, OP, Vienna; University of Fribourg, Switzerland\"Readers will have to engage carefully the issues of memory, identity, effective history, and ecclesial politics in order to think with Bockmuehl about the way he construes the evidence. Protestants are not always quick to remember that no disciple of Jesus has been more important to Christianity than Peter. Bockmuehl's book displays with elegance and erudition some central features of this fact's historical shape.\"--C. Kavin Rowe, Duke Divinity School\"This erudite and accessible book will be welcomed by all who seek to understand not only what historians can surmise about the Galilean peasant Peter but also what such research can contribute to reflection about an ongoing 'Petrine ministry' among Christians today.\"--Matthew Levering, University of Dayton", "related": [], "rank": 1266359, "title": "Simon Peter in Scripture and Memory: The New Testament Apostle in the Early Church", "author": "Markus Bockmuehl", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This novel had less of the mystery of the previous two books, but was simply a fun and romantic story that I really enjoyed. Although it is the third in the series, it can easily be read alone or in any order with the other two books. Instead of following the same characters from book to book, Zane's main characters become minor characters, allowing for a new and fresh set of main characters. It's a fun way of adding a bit of continuity while having a fresh new story each time.\"--Kim", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.875, "rating_total": 31.0}

He also enjoyed writing as a fun past-time as a teenager, writing for high school and college papers, but realized he had to have a serious job as he became a father at an early age. During his business career he spent a lot of time outside the U.S. so traveling time was used to write his experiences and observations and turned them into novels. He did a stint in Europe, working for a U.S. company for 5 years in Belgium, so his understanding of culture and history is not the average American’s.  Along the way he's collected several drawers of rejection letters from agents and publishers. Now in his pre-retirement stage –running a B&B; in Taos with his wife Prudence- he finally has the time to publish his novels using Kindle and Amazon Books as his chosen vehicle to reach the public.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I needed to push that back by adding to the adventure. Marblin\nand the Spirit Men provided means to add excitement, and Marblin's part became\nmore dramatic with each revision. In short, I knew book two was the better half\nof the split as soon as I began writing its new beginning.The novel took on new life when I wrote in the summoning and\nconfrontation (again, I stick to vague references to avoid spoiling fun for\nreaders) at the edge of Dimwood Forest. I was breathless after writing that,\nwhich is always a good sign. I have known this work to be special since that\nrevision, which happened years after writing the original manuscript. My latest\nrevision added the lovely maj'i to Loric's exploration of the lost temple\n(which was originally a solo chapter for our hero). I believe that change added\ndepth to interaction between those characters, which is important.The Fire of Kings set the standard of The Dragon Eyes\nChronicles upon higher ground, which I am working hard to raise higher with\nThe Sons of Donigan. That is the challenge, and I intend to meet it.\nExpect surprises in the next book, which recent revisions have given me\nenergetic rushes to equal the breathlessness I above referenced.

Other recipes include a very easy Chicken Tikka Masala (yes, it is easy and fast and delicious), Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp, Curry Chicken with Coconut and Peanuts, Indian Butter Chicken, Crock Poet Thai Chicken Thighs (inexpensive, easy, prepare ahead), Sweet and Sour Chicken, Indonesian Ginger Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli Thai Curry, Spicy Honey-Orange Chicken. Coconut Chicken with Chili Glaze and Coconut Rice, Thai Basil Chicken - and if those aren't enough to whet the appetite there are more included here!One of the pleasures of following Hannah Jackson's recipes is the friendly, chatty, conversational manner in which the recipes are shared. There are beautiful color photographs of how to present your new chicken dish to the lucky people around your table.

Even as a teenager I used to make up children's stories as I put them to bed while baby sitting. They were always begging me for more, perhaps just to stay up late, perhaps because I used to include them in the stories.Illustrating children's books was an ambition that grew from the early seventies. My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": ["B00D7BVTIQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But something about the little wildcat sets his blood on fire and it doesn't take long for Sam to decide he'd rather see Annie in his bed than swinging from a hangman's noose.

Another goal is to improve the training for managers and administrators of these programs so that employees can be better selected, trained, and treated, and so that they can serve as better role models and supervisors for the youth of America. Most criminal misbehavior can be altered and turned in a positive direction, with decent personal treatment and adequate programs for their individual problems. To allow the continued mistreatment of these individuals is to throw away their future and the future of America. Mr. Chance has discovered a multitude of problems within these systems through his investigations, inquiries, and handling of thousands of complaints about the sexual abuse, mistreatment, neglect, and exploitation of both the inmates in these systems and the employees who work under unbearable conditions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The son of a public servant and a teacher, he was born in 1968 in Rialto, Dublin, a city he describes as “a dumping ground for drug addicts for a long time…it was pretty much ground zero for the heroin epidemic that swept Dublin in the seventies and early eighties.” He then became a freelance journalist for theIrish Times Newspaperafter graduating from Trinity College in Dublin. His debut novel,Every Dead Thing, was published in 1999 to critical acclaim, taking home the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel and the Shamus Award for Best Private Eye Novel.Since then, he has written eleven books in the Charlie Parker Series, several stand-alone novels, and a slew of short stories. Connolly cites veteran authors Ross Macdonald, James Lee Burke, and Ed McBain as the main influences on his rich and introspective prose style. He currently divides his time between his native Ireland and the United States.", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.7273, "rating_total": 52.0}

A busy work schedule currently excludes partners, pets and children, but I hope, eventually, to enjoy all three.I have been writing short stories for as long as I can remember. Over the last ten years, erotic fiction has gradually seduced and dominated my creativity. We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, she earned a degree in interior design from the University of Her Choosing. Pamela has also appeared in regional and national magazines.  She has lived in Pennsylvania, Texas, and finally California when she married her soul mate. They now have two wonderful kids and a rescued dog together.  An avid traveler, Pamela has gone to different places around the world, and is still in search of more places to discover and have foodie adventures.

Chelsea grew up turning wrenches alongside her father, and from that grew her love for old muscle cars and Harley Davidson motorcycles, which just so happened to inspired her ‘Love and Repair’ and ‘The Hellions Ride’ series. Her love for reading has sparked a new love for writing and she currently has a few more projects in the works.        When she is not spending her days writing you can find her playing with her kids, attending car shows, going on motorcycle rides on the back of her husband’s Harley, snuggling down with her new favorite book or watching any movie that Vin Diesel might happen to be in. She hates being serious and is still a big kid at heart. She is a small town country girl enjoying life and, Chelsea hopes that her readers remember not to take life too seriously and to embrace your inner five year old, because five year olds know how to enjoy the simple things in life and how to always have fun.", "related": ["B00JYFN3GA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 145, "rating_average": 4.4759, "rating_total": 649.0}

Later, as war clouds gather, Adelaide, newly married, finds her husband and Rachel have fallen in love. What could have been a tawdry tale of forbidden romance becomes, in the hands of author Sabra Waldfogel, a complex story of survival and the emergence of true love and heroism. Waldfogel has an eye for character and the historical training to ground her story in the milieu of the 1850s and '60s.

Every pew was filled, many with sleepy but excited children, for a special Christmas Eve midnight mass. Father Richard was leading us in the Prayer of the Faithful when a man staggered up the center aisle, his limbs jerking as he alternately murmured and shouted incomprehensible words. We all shrank back as he made his way towards the altar, an unexpected and volatile presence. As the congregation looked on in growing panic, the man accosted Father Richard. The priest didn't move or stop the prayer, just dug through his robes for a pocket. He pulled out a few pesos and pressed them into the man's hand. By that time several of the male congregants had come onto the altar as well. They gently propelled the drug-addled man back down the altar steps and through the church to the rear door. Christmas mass continued. The addict remained nameless to the shaken congregation. But he stayed with all of us, evidence that Mexico's drug problem was growing as more and more drugs transited the country en route to the insatiable United States.  We were an American family in Mexico City, embracing a new culture, exploring a vibrant city, and meeting people who were to impact our lives for years to come. We read with dread the worsening news over the next year: shootouts in major cities, multiple drug seizures, rising numbers of dead and missing, the murders of mayors, governors and journalists. In between the lines I understood the toll that the drug wars were taking on the people and culture of Mexico. I carried my memories of Mexico with me when we left. I poured them into a new novel, bringing a fast-paced contemporary style to a Cinderella story set against the backdrop of political corruption and cartel violence.
