She joins an expedition setting out along the Santa Fe Trail, its stated purpose to prove that the eccentric genius Charles Babbage's \"difference engine,\" a mechanical computer prototype, can reliably calculate the exact latitude of an eclipse. Selena is an American, but she was raised a tomboy in France by her sea captain father, and she brings to her frontier adventure a cultured European manner coupled with progressive attitudes about a woman's place in the world. This sets her at odds with the chauvinistic explorers on the expedition, chief among them William Henshaw Pryce, Charles Babbage's financial adviser. Pryce has a secret (and nefarious) plan to locate the remains of Babbage's fabulously wealthy great uncle Richard and claim the inheritance that remains intestate in England years after the old geezer's disappearance in America. Selena braves desert rigors, the condescension and perfidy of her colleagues, and savage Native Americans in her race toward the first scientifically recorded total eclipse in the American Southwest. While Byrd tacks on a mystery and thriller subplot at the end to create a semblance of tension, the book is mostly an engaging travelogue along the old Santa Fe Trail, served up with plenty of authentic frontier detail and enough lessons in early 19th-century navigation to satisfy the most clueless bushwhacker as to his or her exact longitude and latitude.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Archaeobiologist Andrew  Quatermas encounters one in the form of a stromatolite, a rock formation constructed billions of years ago by fossilized microorganisms.But these crystals are hardly moribund--when soaked in carbon or boron compounds, they start furiously synthesizing the chemical machinery of life. Studying them with his mass spectrometer and gamma-ray microscope, physicist Miklav Petrovsky detects unnatural elements and tiny structures that, he instantly surmises, add up to \"a rocket between dimensions or universes\" that \"came from somewhere beyond the Planck limit.\"A few days and a biocontainment breach later, the campus suddenly finds itself on the front lines of a conflict between twotransgalactic civilizations -- one is on a crusade to perfect the universe and abolish entropy, while the other is populated by artificial-intelligence systems that smoke too much and worry about keeping their jobs.This is hardcore science fiction, full of endless laboratory, procedural and techie dialogue -- \"So, if electromagnetism were super-symmetric, the fermionic photinos would exactly cancel the photonic contribution and there would be no Casimir lasing\" -- that might mean something to a theoretical physicist but it's difficult for the lay reader.It's also got grand musings on the origin and fate of the universe and the meaning of existence, most memorably from the Church of the Unanswered Question, whose Sartrean prayer services include lines like \"We believe in the profound irony of life\" and \"God is distant, remote and utterly alien.\"Kelly sometimes overdoes it, but her writing is well-paced with gripping action scenes and touches of humor, and she gets enough of the science and Big Ideas across, despite the tech speak, to pique the reader's interest.Readers will look forward to seeing how this imaginative cosmos unfolds in future installments.Kirkus Discoveries, Nielsen Business Media, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003   discoveries@kirkusreviews.com --Kirkus   Kirkus Reviews, November 11, 2009HEAT DEATH: A Romance.

Self-conscious and yet completely un–self-aware, journalist Sebastian Zollner attempts to outdo his art critic rival by writing the biography of reclusive painter Manuel Kaminski. Sebastian is amusingly sad, if one-note: he lives in denial that his live-in girlfriend broke up with him months ago; after an offhand comment by a transit worker, he becomes obsessed with his receding hairline; and he detests in others everything he so blithely ignores about himself. He weasels himself into Kaminski's household, snoops through the artist's private files, discovers a series of unfinished paintings and attempts to up the drama by reuniting Kaminski with his ex-wife, long thought dead. It quickly becomes clear, however, that Kaminski is manipulating pathetic Sebastian, and Sebastian's plans are thwarted in favor of the master's own. There are entertaining and lightly satirical moments, but for the most part the story feels rushed, with everyone except Sebastian getting short shrift.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here he presents two plays, both of which focus on  the dysfunctional Cassandra family and are linked by one minor  event: Marigold Cassandra's suspension from her job at the  Agriculture Department. None of the three acts of the first  play, \"Hell Hound on My Trail,\" is related except for the  mention of some characters from act to act. The second play,  \"Shoppers Carried by Escalators into the Flames,\" is situated in  Ukiah, CA, at the beginning of the third millennium. It is more  coherent than the previous play, as a continuity of action is  sustained by all three acts. However, neither play concludes  anything, and nothing is resolved. These plays are somewhat  entertaining to read and may be enjoyable to see performed  because of their colorful characters, but they are best at  demonstrating Johnson's versatility as a writer who can change  genres easily.

In this valuable resource, she paints an upbeat assessment of the teaching life that doesn't gloss over harsh realities like no air conditioning, low pay, tons of germs and plenty of problem students (tellingly, the chapter on discipline is twice as long as any other). Though it's slim, this thoughtfully organized book packs a trove of information in chapters covering \"The Profession and The Politics,\" \"The Money,\" \"The Nuts and Bolts,\" \"Creative Lesson Plans\" and \"Discipline.\" In a friendly but no-nonsense style, Armstrong provides straightforward advice and anecdotes to support lessons like, \"the three-month vacation is a myth\" and \"your students can read you like a book.\" In addition, Armstrong includes plenty of suggestions for dealing with colleagues, as well as some fairly radical big-picture theories such as \"Compulsory education may have outlived its usefulness,\" and \"large classes aren't the bogeymen you've been led to believe.\" Novice and experienced K-12 teachers will benefit from Armstrong's work, but anyone with a stake in educational policy or looking for an on-the-ground perspective should take an interest in this volume.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During his late teens and early twenties he played guitar in a rock 'n' roll band called Gunfire Dance, who received fleeting notoriety during the early 1990's. With the intention of becoming a writer, in 1996 he moved to New York City, a place he had become familiar with due to the band's numerous performances there. Following his debut novel, Mac & Beth, which followed a cast of foul-mouthed football hooligan-types who unwittingly re-enact Shakespeare's Scottish play, Ward concentrated on a true fiction, touching closely on his personal experience of his first year in New York City. Parasite is a modern-day immigrant tale set in New York City, amidst the harsh environment of crystal meth addiction and abusive relationships. It is a memoir, a true-fiction dedicated to two lost friends. In a series of back-and-forth episodes, he celebrates the vaudeville cast of reprobate pleasure victims that surrounded him on the dole in England, and on the run in New York: rock 'n' rollers, ravers, artists, escorts, models, freaks, fruits, fag hags, football hooligans, drug dealers, wannabe-gangsters. A sequel to Parasite with the working title Carry on Dreaming is already completed, and bastardizing other Shakespeare plays is under consideration. He remains in New York City, occasionally recording what he calls 'agnostic spirituals' for his music project and sometime band, Electra Jet.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each of these three chapters ends with a question-and-answer section that can be used for quick reference. Chapters 3 and 6 provide an excellent introduction to researching patents and trademarks, respectively, especially online. The appendixes include Yehuda Berlinger’s humorous “Intellectual Property Codes in Verse” and a list of patent and trademark depository libraries.

En el año 2008 di comienzo a mi actividad bloguera, con el fin de publicar informacion sobre la actividad aerea, luego escriba­ varios trabajos de analisis sobre distintas tema¡ticas necesarias para la formacion, como son manuales de VOR, descifrado de mensajes meteorologicos. Nivel de Transicion, y varios tutoriales mÃ¡s. Estos siempre basados en legislacion, usos y costumbres y ejemplos de nuestro paÃ­s, ofreciendo casos que fueran practicos al momento de volar. A medida que publicaba recibia agradecimientos de muchos pilotos por este tipo manuales ya que era de mucha utilidad en sus primeras horas de vuelo y otros en la realizacion del curso teorico para la licencia de piloto comercial. Asi nacia la idea de ampliar lo publicado hasta ese momento e incorporar nuevos temas, da¡ndole un formato de manual para favorecer la lectura y agrupado por temas. A la hora de estudiar otro problema con el que me encontraba es que la informacion estaba diseminada en varias publicaciones, un caso testigo es la reglamentacion, que no siempre se encuentra al alcance de todos o a la hora de buscar no sabemos donde hacerlo. Sobre este tema he incorporado las ultimas actualizaciones sobre las principales reglas de vuelo, planes de vuelo, espacios aereos, sistemas de navegacion, como guia para que el piloto tenga facilitada la tarea de aprendizaje. Este trabajo no hubiera sido posible sin el Ã¡nimo y el apoyo de familiares que me han motivado siempre a su realizacion. Gran cantidad de horas invertidas en la realizacion, mucho esfuerzo, pero con un placer enorme que me reconforta el espi­ritu. Espero que este libro sea muy util para todos aquellos pilotos que aman la actividad y que colabore en su formacion. Si logro el objetivo que el lector tenga un texto que lo ayude en parte de su formacion habra realizado el sueño que me lleva a escribirlo.\" Roberto Gomez", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We were founded with one goal in mind; bring entrepreneurship to everyone.  The founders have over a decade of combined experience with two of the largest consulting firms in the world.  The founders have various consulting experience including mergers and acquisitions, financial analysis, business process improvement, and information technology.  Additionally, one founder is an award winning business plan writer and successful entrepreneur. Why Upstart Business Consulting Group was Founded Entrepreneurship is the true passion of the founders.  There are a lot of business plan templates and business plan writing services available for purchase.  After reviewing many of these plans, the founders realized they were not only lacking critical information, but they were not tailored to a specific business as they had been advertised.  When one founder said, “There has to be a better way”, Upstart Business Consulting Group was born.  The idea was simple; provide detailed, informative, and targeted business plan kits to upstart entrepreneurs so they can open their business faster and with less upfront capital.  We create business plan kits for the entrepreneur who has $10,000 or less of available startup capital.   There is no Better Time than Now It does not matter if you are a recent college graduate, a worker trying to make ends meet and save for retirement, a burned out mid-level manager trying to climb the corporate ladder, or a retiring baby boomer, there is no better time than now to become an entrepreneur.  The founders of Upstart Business Consulting Group have realized this, and now it is your turn to follow your passion and take your future into your own hands.", "related": [], "rank": 3249379, "title": "Christmas Light Installation Business eBook", "author": "Steven Primm", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So allow me to introduce myself: My name is Antony Birks and I'm a certified intuitive life coach. I'm a dynamic 50 years old, a family man with a loving wife and 4 children to keep me on my toes. I was born in London and spent the first 30 years of my life there. On my 30th birthday I left England, after having completed a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Sociology at Kingston University, and moved to Germany, quite a change from the busy streets of London. We now live in a little village in northern Germany. For the past twenty years, I've been working with people, assisting them in an advisory capacity. As a community representative, I have been invited to participate in a number of projects - some of them demanding but at the same time very fulfilling. As a Life Coach, I hold the title - L.C.H Dip. accreditation, that I gained while working with one of Europe's leading Life Coaches, \"Curly Martin\". My vocation and purpose in life has become more clear over the last few years. It became apparent that my people skills, including my ever present English humour, is a major part of who I am. I pride myself in my listening abilities, I am professional in my relationship with all those that I come into contact with. I get an incredible amount of satisfaction in assisting people who are willing to change certain areas of their lives. Planning and accompanying a specific goal for someone, providing regular motivation and assistance, is all part of my unique life coaching package. The creative process is a very important part of my life. Oil painting, mainly landscapes, but also abstract expression, is a great medium to express myself. Tai Chi and meditation balance out the Ying and Yang. My English garden is also important in allowing me a place to feel secure and allow my creativity to work undisturbed. Creativity is something I encourage greatly in my clients. Over time Spirituality has become more and more significant in everything I do. The Laws of Attraction and Reciprocity are part of the method that I teach to my clients, and are an integral part of my daily life and my life coaching practice. Giving something back to society - be it in the form of a donation or to volunteer my time for some good cause, is key to living a peaceful and serene life. Helping those less fortunate than ourselves is a certain way of helping ourselves live a more fulfilling life.", "related": [], "rank": 645339, "title": "One Hundred and One Daily Challenges and Affirmations: Helping to find inner peace and happiness in daily life", "author": "Coach Antony", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lawrence-led Bedouins against the Turks, Chinese Communists against Nationalists and?most instructive for the future?the Vietnamese Communists against first the French, then the Americans. Because the U.S. will likely encounter comparatively \"little\" wars in the coming decades, fought mostly against guerrillas whose doctrines will derive from the teachings of Mao Zedong and Vo Nguyen Giap, we no longer need our heavy divisions designed to fight the Soviet Army. Alexander recommends downsizing to small, highly mobile battle groups trained in counterguerrilla tactics. The U.S. can gain its most significant victories by negotiation and diplomacy, he believes, and argues that we should intervene militarily only when protecting our strategic imperatives. In his view, the U.S. would do well to assume the role of \"honest broker,\" working through third parties rather than continuing to serve as the world's police officer.

Maybe it was fate or destiny, but Hawn did not plan to be a journalist. The doors opened for him and he entered through them, which led him to a spectacular career spanning 43 years. He was in the service when Colonel Fleming asked him if he would like to be in PIO, Public Information Office. The PIO writes articles about new recruits and sends them to their hometown papers. The Colonel said they would teach him to write. With little hesitation, Hawn agreed to a transfer, but days later left word he had reconsidered and decided to remain where he he had been assigned--checking GI's baggage. Surpringly, weeks later he was ordered to PIO, where his career unknowingly was launched. When Hawn left the Army he had a family to support and no job. He started as a newspaper copy boy in Hollywood, Calif., and 16 years later when the paper went bankrupt was hired by the Los Angeles Times, where he worked for 10 years in sports and 11 years in entertainment. I found it refreshing to \"meet\" Jack Hawn and to watch him learn the industry of journalism while on the job.One of the most important elements in a memoir is for the author to make himself visible to his or her readers. Author Jack Hawn successfully allows readers to get to know the real Jack Hawn. He uses photographs to draw readers closer to him.

Murphy and his team are also instructed in developing their mental telepathy and other powers.Ciolli has a grand plan in place for further adventures (at least I hope he does) and I'm sure after reading CHRONOS PROPHECIES, you, too, will want to find out more of the secrets that the two races share.Diane Donovan, eBook Reviewer, Midwest Book Review, November 2011Chronos Prophecies, Rise of the Telepaths is part of a science fiction series and representsmilitary science fiction at its best.While familiarity with the preceding novel Chronos will help in a smooth transition to this sequel, in actuality Chronos Prophecies, Rise of the Telepaths requires no introduction to prove satisfying and is accessible to the newcomer. Its opening chapter uses dialogue and character interaction to deftly provide settings and concepts that will serve readers throughout the story.Descriptive action is well done and features fine settings and atmosphere throughout:Action and adventure and the pace of personal and group discoveries are well done and provide a blend of swift action and thoughtful explorations of the evolution of telepaths and their purposes.Swift military action combined with hard science fiction make Chronos Prophecies, Rise of the Telepaths a satisfying, complex novel.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 1060710, "title": "Chronos Prophecies: The Rise of the Telepaths - Book three of the Chronos Military Science Fiction series", "author": "Tom Ciolli", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What are some of the titles you've narrated/performed for Brilliance Audio?James Daniels:I’m glad you asked! Folks who try to alleviate their torturous commutes with audio books may recall the husky rasp of Joe Pike in Robert Crais’ Elvis Cole mysteries – that’s me. Or the snarl of Iraqi terrorists in Robert Tannenbaum’s “Reckless Endangerment” – that’s me. Or the orgasmic gasps of the lovers in Nora Roberts’ “Midnight Bayou” – yes, that’s me too. I’ve channeled thugs and thieves, spooks and specters, feds, fogeys, and femme fatales in about forty different audio books by writers who run the gamut from Elizabeth Lowell and Philip Roth. Reading aloud is a great way to experience a book, and it taught me a lot as a writer; namely, rhythm, pacing, character, and dialogue.Question:Ring of Knivesis your first published novel. How did it come about? James Daniels:My brother Mike, who’s a writer on the hit show ‘Sons of Anarchy’, was a student of Lee Goldberg’s, and introduced me to him. Out of the kindness of his heart, Lee read through a mystery I’d been working on, and wound up suggesting that I could contribute a book to the Dead Man series, which is his and Bill Rabkin’s creation. I couldn’t believe my luck. I fell all over myself accepting. But when I saw who else would be contributing, I got vertigo. Virtually all of the other authors writing books for this series are pulp fiction gods... some of them have written hundreds of novels, many of them have published in a dozen separate genres, some have created best sellers... And then there's unpublished me. If Lee’s lineup of authors is like a row of statues of Greek deities in a museum, I'm the bobble-head Elvis that someone set down between Zeus and Athena. No joke. But I’m very grateful for the chance to contribute not one but two novellas to this series. It has been – and I mean this literally – a life-changing experience.Question: What is it about The Dead Man series that appeals to you creatively?James Daniels:I love the fact that the central character in the series is a loner who travels endlessly in search of the answer to a mystery which will heal both himself and others. To me, this type of tale hearkens back to the Grail legend, which I incorporated intoRing of Knives. I think that Matt is the modern-day equivalent of the medieval knight errant, and also of the gunslinger-in-a-white-hat, who is his American descendant. This set-up is an incredibly flexible template for storytelling, and it allows the author to take it in any direction possible. I've seen brief summaries of the stories to come, and they range from gritty urban shoot-em-ups to gothic Lovecraftian lore. It's wonderful stuff. My own brand of pulp is derived pretty directly from Edgar Rice Burroughs; he’s the one who first snagged my attention as a twelve-year old, and those old-style heroics never cease to move me. So I've taken a lot of inspiration from John-Carter-type stories and fashioned my own tale, which I dressed up in the trappings of Clive Barker, fed raw meat, and unleashed.Question:What's your approach to writing the violence? How do you make it emotionally meaningful and not just simple action & gore?James Daniels:My dirty secret: I love writing about violence. Love it. A well-written fight always gets my blood pumping: makes me ball my hands into fists when thehero takes a hit, or get a thrill of release when he lands a haymaker.I think a well-choreographed fight is like a microcosm of the overall story: it's got a beginning, middle, and end; it has an inciting incident, climax, and denouement; and it should reveal character. It should also--I think--always contain a surprise. There's nothing more boring than reading about two guys just whacking away at each other 'til one of them falls down. The fight should somehow make use of the setting in which the characters find themselves... A battle in a saw mill shouldn't be the same as one in the rigging of an opera house, or on a sandbar. Each fight should be unique. And in my opinion, the hero should usually be at a serious disadvantage until the last moment: \"always outnumbered, always outgunned,\" as Walter Mosely put it.I think to jazz up a fight, writers should give themselves the challenge of trying to incorporate the setting into the fight, or have one of the characters use an unusual prop. Remember in “Alien” when the android tries to shove the rolled-up magazine down Sigourney Weaver's throat? What a horrific, brilliant, memorable image. I haven't seen that movie in twelve years and I still remember that vividly. Would it be so vivid if he just punched her? No way. So that's the challenge. And I think, if anything, writers have to be willing to trust their instincts, even when they stretch logic. The rolled-up-magazine attack is a really odd choice, when you think about it. But in execution, it's terrifying. There's a similarly effective moment in the original “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” where one of the miscreants attacks a girl with a broom. Or in Stephen King'sBag of Bones, where the villain attacks a swimmer by throwing rocks at him... the possibilities are endless.Question: What have you learned from the experience?James Daniels:My break withRing of Knivescame solely because Lee Goldberg chose to take an interest in me. But looking back on it, the past few months have taught me two things. First, that writing heroic fiction is a lot more energizing and satisfying than writing ultra-realistic “kitchen sink” drama, or postmodern puzzlers. And second, that the business of writing seems to be largely about developing relationships. And that’s a hard lesson, because a lot of writers, I think, are not confident socially, especially when dealing with authors, agents, publishers, and even their readers. But I now think that that side of it is just as important as the writing itself – at least, it is if the writer’s goal is to reach a wider audience.Question:So, withRing of Knivesbehind you, was writing the upcoming Dead Man taleThe Beast Withineasier...or did it present new challenges for you?James Daniels:It was easier in one way, because the revisions I had to do inRing of Kniveshelped me understand what kind of a character Matt is. For instance, he’s much more compassionate and conscientious than I had initially thought. So forThe Beast Within, it was easier developing character and writing dialogue. But the plot was very challenging because I think each episode that’s been written really ups the ante, contributing more and more thrilling scenarios with fast-paced action, terrifying twists, and great cliffhangers. I had readThe Dead Woman,Blood MesaandKill Them All, which precede The Beast Within, and I knew a really high standard had been set. So it took some serious reworking of the plot before I thought my second novella could maintain the momentum that its predecessors had established.Question: What's next for you? James Daniels:I’ve always admired Charles Ardai’sHard Case Crimeline, and now that I’ve heard that pulp valkyrie Christa Faust has joined the Dead Man team, I’m eager to see if I can finish a piece I started earlier this year calledSkin the Cat, with the goal of catching Ardai’s eye.

A prime suspect is Luraok Taylor, whose family is scarred by incest, murder and insanity. She returns to town after serving eight years in prison for murdering her father, but ex-fiance Ben Portlock, a police officer who helped put her away, still can't believe Lura is the serial killer. A more likely suspect is Portis Jackson, successful bank vice-president and sexual sadist who wants to kill wife Edie's baby, fathered by Ben's libidinous partner, Bryce McKee. Edie, Ben's sister, is desperate to escape her abusive marriage to Portis, who makes home porn tapes with his secretary Kayleen, the town minister's sister. When Kayleen uses one of these tapes to blackmail Portis, it leads to murder. Epperson interweaves these complex plot threads with panache, expertly pacing the narrative to culminate in a horrific confrontation between Edie and the fetus-obsessed killer that will haunt the reader.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006LAX1VS"], "rank": 540164, "title": "Dumford Blood", "author": "S.K.

The good news is that doctors are human beings. The bad news is that doctors are human beings. The other good news is that this book marks a stunning debut.' Margaret Atwood, upon introducing Lam at the Giller Prize presentation 'Reading about medical problems and what goes on in the emergency ward is just absolutely enthralling to all of us, but in this case it's much more than that - it's the characters and the movement and the ease of the storytelling that I just found so irresistible.' Alice Munro 'A masterly debut...incisive, clear prose as faultless as a carefully stitched suture.' Guardian 'Fresh and sparkling...almost every story here has the compulsive what-next charge of true drama beautifully carried by Lam's clear, understated, confident prose.' Sunday Times 'Scalpel sharp, as cool and polished as the steel of the mortuary table.'

The opportunities with being an author, and the incredible\npeople I meet who believe they are destined to read my story, is heartwarming. They help me heal even further. The support I receive from such organizations\nas the Arizona Lung Association, who promote my book and workshop in their\nDesert Pathways newsletter, is a testament to the theory a book has a mind of\nits own. To all of you I say thank you. Looking back at\nthis book published parallel to my path of grief I am amazed a work written to share\nmy love for my sister speaks to so many about grief. My sister's been gone many years now, but the\nmessage remains the same. Hold tight to\nthose you love, and remember them always in your heart. It's no longer\nthe pain I had in the beginning, but an ache that is different. It will be a part of my life forever because\nit was a traumatic loss. Death of a loved one is one of the most difficult\nthings any of us will face in life; we are forever changed by it. Being able to share my love for my sister and\nthe pain of her loss in this book is incredibly healing. It allows me to come to terms with loss in a\nnew phase of my life. A life that goes\non with her still is always on my mind. Knowing others\nin my grief support family are willing to listen to me and answer the questions\nI need to ask is helpful. They allow me\nto come back to me. I reciprocate in my\nheart and by listening to them. The\nJourney from Grief to Gratitude workshop (see appendix outline) done with this\nbook, and in her memory, allows me to give back. Others in need of healing from grief respond\nand I am at my true center. Because friends\nand family admit they do not have all the answers during years of sorrow, I\nchoose to face grief courageously but cautiously when it appears. It is a\nprocess and one we each take at our own pace and in our own way. We have help available if we look for it along\nwith others who travel the grief path.We can ask them to join us.  I am\na willing student on the subject and thus myJourney from Grief to Gratitudeworkshop continues to develop. It is my opportunity to share my story and be\nof service to those grieving. It's a\nvehicle for my own healing while my strengthened faith remains the greatest\ngift since this loss. My spiritual quest continues to be fed and I now know\npeace. The honesty of\nthe other authors I read who write on grief give me a new appreciation and\nenlightenment on the subject. I am more resilient\nas time heals wounds. Although the pain\nof the loss never completely goes away it does go to a different place and we\ncan go on with our lives. It is with\nmuch gratitude for this knowledge I take my book to a new place too. Many of my friends\noffer me reassurance, acceptance and caring.These gestures of kindness helped me to write, and later revise for this\nedition, a book that reveals uncovered depths of my emotional life. My workshop, with a goal of helping others in\ngrief discover their new being, is a direct response to those who were my first\nreaders. Thank you to all\nthe people who read my book, attend one of my workshops and offer feedback. Your open and honest sharing of your grief\nstories gives me even more understanding about my own loss. Your allowing me to share my feelings is cathartic\nand a big part of my journey home. The journey from\ngrief to gratitude can be long and very difficult at times, but it is also a\npath to forgiveness and joy if we are open to the people we meet along the way. To care about ourselves and others is God's\nplan for all of us.  Regardless of what\nchallenges are in our path today, growth and awareness can be part of the\njourney. We eventually realize\nwe are not alone in our grief and that we all grieve in our own ways. Regardless of how raw we are in the\nbeginning, we come to realize we have to talk about the death of our loved one\nto heal. This is how we gain\nindependence from grief. Writing this\nbook allowed me to talk it out. The\njournal pages and questions here should help you to talk it out too. My sister is\ndeep within my heart and soul today. I\ndo very few things now where I don't ask myself what she would think or say\nabout my decision. The enormity of\nanything is paled when we are side-by-side in our hearts with the one who has\npassed away. I keepGifts of Sisterhoodclose to me for guidance. It was written for a reason. There was a plan for the book and it\ncontinues to unfold in a beautiful way.Now as an E-book it will be even more beautiful and useful. It's comforting to me to have her spirit in\nmy life. She did not die in vain; she\njust moved me closer to God.", "related": ["B0057AN05A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hollywood, and history, hasn't been as kind to Varian Fry, even though he shared a similar heroic streak. Varian Fry saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust, including some of the \"brightest stars of European culture.\" Marc Chagall, Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Arendt... these are just a few of the luminaries who owe their lives to him. How is it, then, that Fry's name isn't just as recognizable as theirs? Dara Horn aims to remedy that in this Kindle Single, and in the process examines other interesting questions: Is there such a thing as a rescuer's mentality? Do individuals like Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry agonize over their dangerous work, wrestle with the moral complexities involved--are they ever afraid? Or, are they hardwired to \"immediately recognize what [any given] situation calls for\" with an almost auto-response? For that matter, did the Nazis agonize over their actions? Hannah Arendt reasoned that the evil perpetrated on the Jews was possible because of certain individuals' \"inability to think.\" Horn's Kindle Single begs us all to do the opposite: think, ask questions, and remember the Varian Frys of the world, whose work she convincingly argues should be lauded just as much as, if not more than, any of the \"bright stars\" this forgotten hero saved. --Erin Kodicek", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": 441917, "title": "The Rescuer (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Dara Horn", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

Thinking that he has the listening skills needed for the volunteer hotline, Billy signs up, and one regular caller, Jenney, calls Billy “Hallmark” for the warm feelings he brings. Soon Billy begins obsessing over Jenney, even as he worries that his father’s antidepressants have triggered a manic episode that is manifesting in all-night painting sessions. While Billy is confident that his judgment concerning both Jenney and his father is sound, the reader is clued into Billy’s self-serving, immature diagnosis. The insider view of a suicide hotline is a poignant one. Like the realistic novels of Todd Strasser, this compelling title places a young person in a moral quandary that could literally mean the difference between life and death.

Bridget, the main character,\nquickly discovers who she really is and what she's up against in the Fae World.\nShe's becomes acquainted with Irish relatives, learns she is a land owner, and\nwhen events go awry, Bridget becomes quite the sleuth with the help of a\ntalking dog who in actuality, is an entity from the Fae World.Meanwhile, Mary, her bestfriend and travel companion to the Emerald Isle,\ndiscovers life can be enjoyable and not dictated by a 9 to 5 job. She finds\nmeeting an intriguing, intelligent, hunk might just be her match and what she's\nbeen missing in her life.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Miles away, traffic along the dual carriageway thundered on its way to the west, unheard and unheeded in the quiet countryside around the village of Hindley, its inhabitants for the most part still sleeping in their beds. Farm workers were already about their work, though; the bleating of sheep and the sounds of horses and cattle were blotted out from time to time by the sound of a tractor being started up; but on the brow of the hill rising behind the village these sounds were faint, the bird-song was louder.Half-way up the hill a girl sat, leaning comfortably against the trunk of a fallen tree, a shaggy dog sprawled beside her. She had drawn up her knees, clasped her arms around them and rested her chin on them—a pretty, rounded chin, but determined too, belying the wide, gentle mouth and the soft brown eyes with their thick black lashes. Her hair was long and brown, plaited and hanging over one shoulder. She flung it back with a well-shaped hand and spoke to the dog.'There—the sun's rising on the longest day of the year, Knotty. Midsummer Madness—the high tide of the year, a day for fairies and elves, a day for making a wish. Do you suppose if I made one it might come true?'Knotty, usually obliging with his replies, took no notice, but growled softly, cocked his large, drooping ears and allowed his teeth to show. He got to his feet and she put a restraining hand on his collar, turning to look behind her as she caught the sound of steady feet and someone coming along, whistling.Knotty barked as a man left the line of trees and came towards them. A giant of a man, dressed in an open-necked shirt and elderly trousers, his pale hair shone in the sunlight and he walked with an easy self-assurance. Tucked under one arm was a small dog, a Jack Russell, looking bedraggled.He stopped by the girl, towering over her so that she was forced to crane her neck to see his face. 'Good morning. Perhaps you can help me?' He had put down a balled fist for Knotty to examine, ignoring the teeth.'I found this little chap down a rabbit-hole—couldn't get out and probably been there for some time. Is there a vet around here?' He smiled at her. 'The name's Latimer—Oliver Latimer.'The girl got to her feet, glad for once that she was a tall girl, and very nearly able to look him in the face. 'Beatrice Browning. That's Nobby—Miss Mead's dog. She'll be so very glad, he's been missing for a couple of days—everyone has been out looking for him. Where was he?''About a mile on the other side of these woods—there's a stretch of common land… The vet?''You'd better come with me. Father will be up by now; he's leaving early to visit a couple of farms.'She started down the hill towards the village below. 'You're out early,' she observed.'Yes. You too. It's the best time of the day, isn't it?'She nodded. They had left the hill behind them and were in a narrow rutted lane, the roofs of the village very close.'You live here?' he wanted to know. He spoke so casually that she decided that he was merely making polite conversation.'My home is here; I live with an aunt in Wilton.' She turned to look at him. 'Well, not all the time—I'm staying with her until she can get another companion.' She went on walking. 'Actually she's a great-aunt.'She frowned; here she was, handing out information which couldn't be of the slightest interest to this man. She said austerely, 'What a splendid day it is. Here we are.' Her father's house was of a comfortable size surrounded by a large, overgrown garden, and with a paddock alongside for any animals he might need to take under his care. She led the way around the side of the house, so in through the back door, and found her father sitting on the doorstep drinking tea. He wished her good morning and looked enquiringly at her companion. 'A patient already—bless me, that's Nobby! Hurt?''Nothing broken, I fancy. Hungry and dehydrated, I should imagine.''Mr Latimer found him down a rabbit-hole the other side of Billings Wood,' said Beatrice. 'My father,' she added rather unnecessarily.The two men shook hands, and Nobby was handed over to be examined by her father. Presently he said, 'He seems to have got off very lightly. There's no reason why he shouldn't go straight back to Miss Mead.''If you will tell me where to go, I'll take him as I walk back.'Beatrice had poured the tea into two mugs. 'Have some tea first,' she offered. 'Do you want to phone anyone? This must have delayed you…''Stay for breakfast?' suggested her father. 'My wife will be down directly—I want to be well away before eight o'clock.' He glanced up. 'Far to go?''Telfont Evias—I'm staying with the Elliotts.''George Elliott? My dear chap, give him a ring and say you're staying for breakfast. It's all of three miles. Beatrice, will you show him where the telephone is? You can take Nobby back while breakfast is being cooked.'Miss Mead lived right in the village in one of the charming cottages which stood on either side of the main street. Trees edged the cobbled pavement and the small front gardens were a blaze of colour. Mr Latimer strolled along beside Beatrice, Nobby tucked under one arm, talking of this and that in his deep voice. Quite nice, but a bit placid, Beatrice decided silently, peeping sideways at his profile. He was undoubtedly good-looking as well as being extremely large. Much, much larger than James, the eldest son of Dr Forbes, who had for some time now taken it for granted that she would marry him when he asked her…She decided not to think about him for the moment, and instead pointed out the ancient and famous inn on the corner of the street and suggested that they might cross over, since Miss Mead's little cottage was on the other side.Miss Mead answered their knock on her door. She was tall and thin and elderly, and very ladylike. She wore well-made skirts and blouses, and covered them with cardigans of a suitable weight according to the time of year, and drove a small car. She was liked in the village, but guardedly so, for she had an acid tongue if annoyed.But now her stern face crumpled into tearful delight. 'Nobby—where have you been?' She took him from Mr Latimer and hugged him close.'You found him. Oh, I'm so grateful, I can never thank you enough—I've hardly slept…'She looked at them in turn. 'He's not hurt? Has your father seen him, Beatrice?''Yes, Miss Mead. Mr Latimer found him down a rabbit-hole and carried him here.''He seems to have come to no harm,' interpolated Mr Latimer in his calm voice. 'Tired and hungry and thirsty—a couple of days and he'll be quite fit again.''You're so kind—really, I don't know how to thank you…''No need, Miss Mead. He's a nice little chap.' He turned to Beatrice. 'Should we be getting back? I don't want to keep your father waiting.'A bit cool, she thought, agreeing politely, wishing Miss Mead goodbye and waiting while she shook hands with her companion and thanked him once again. Perhaps his placid manner hid arrogance. Not that it mattered, she reflected, walking back with him and responding politely to his gentle flow of talk; they were most unlikely to meet again. A friend of the Elliotts, staying for a day or two, she supposed.He proved to be a delightful guest. Her mother sat him down beside her and plied him with breakfast and a steady flow of nicely veiled questions, which he answered without telling her anything at all about himself. That he knew the Elliotts was a fact, but where he came from and what he did somehow remained obscure. All the same, Mrs Browning liked him, and Beatrice's three sisters liked him too, taking it in turns to engage him in conversation. And he was charming to them; Ella, fifteen and still at school, Carol, on holiday from the stockbroker's office where she worked in Salisbury, and Kathy, getting married in a few weeks' time…They were all so pretty, thought Beatrice without rancour; she was pretty herself, but at twenty-six and as the eldest she tended to regard them as very much younger than herself, partly because they were all cast in a smaller mould and could get into each other's size tens, while she was forced to clothe her splendid proportions in a size fourteen.Mr Latimer didn't overstay his welcome; when her father got up from the table he got up too, saying that he must be on his way. He thanked Mrs Browning for his breakfast, bade her daughters goodbye and left the house with Mr Browning, bidding him goodbye too as they reached the Land Rover parked by the gate and setting off at a leisurely pace in the direction of Telfont Evias.'What a very nice man,' observed Mrs Browning, peering at his retreating back from the kitchen window. 'I do wonder…' She sighed silently and glanced at Beatrice, busy clearing the breakfast-table. 'I don't suppose we shall see him again—I mean, Lorna Elliott has never mentioned him.''Perhaps he's not a close friend.' Ella, on her way to get the school bus, kissed her mother and ran down the drive.And after that no one had much more to say about him; there was the washing-up to do, beds to make, rooms to Hoover and dust and lunch to plan, and as well as that there were the dogs and cats to feed and the old pony in the paddock to groom.Mr Browning came back during the morning, saw several patients, just had his coffee and then dashed away again to see a sick cow; and at lunch the talk was largely about Great-Aunt Sybil who lived in Wilton and to whom Beatrice was acting as a companion until some luckless woman would be fool enough to answer her advertisement. Beatrice had been there three weeks already, and that, she pointed out with some heat, was three weeks too long. She was only at home now because the old lady had taken herself off to London to be given her yearly check-up by the particular doctor she favoured. She was ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The priest's archaeologically based articles hinting at heresy have already attracted Vatican attention, and a secretly recovered artifact, handed down for years and as yet unseen, could indeed rewrite religious history. Do clues that Connor and Laura uncover also connect with threats received in Washington against nuclear power plants?

Skidding to a halt just inside the doorway, he asked excitedly, \"Have you a crust of bread or, mayhap, a bannock cake to ease my hunger?\"The jolly, round-faced cook grinned at the laird's young grandson and tipped her fuzzy-haired gray head in the direction of the freshly made bannock cakes piled in a wooden bowl on the long, scarred table just behind her. \"Take more than one, lad. You're to begin your squire's trainin' on the morrow,\" she reminded him unnecessarily, \"and you need to be buildin' your strength.\" She turned back to her task at the hearth then, her aged bulk causing the stool to creak as she resettled herself upon its hard surface.Daniel scooped up several of the flat cakes and tossed them inside his kit. He whistled merrily as he passed his mother's maid in the corridor and dipped his head in greeting to her. Her cheeks pinkened as she nodded shyly in return, dropping her eyes to the rush-covered stone floor as she scurried past him. She was a sweet--and Daniel thought--very lovely brown-haired lass of fourteen summers, only a few moons older than he was himself. He turned his head to watch her departure as he continued walking in the opposite direction and collided into a wall sconce in the process. Thankfully, the lass was now too far away to notice his clumsy encounter with the light source.As he ambled across the bailey toward the fortress gate, he saw his grandfather, a tall and white-haired, but still clearly robust man of nigh on sixty summers, standing with his lieutenant near the entrance to the training field. \"Good morn, Grandfather!\" he called out to him. When the older man turned in his direction, Daniel continued, \"I'm off to the loch to catch a few trout for our dinner!\"\"'Tis a fine day for it, lad. And a good way it is to spend your last day of freedom before the next part of your training begins!\" the old man rejoined before turning back to the other man to continue their discussion.As all the villagers and most of the castle's household had gone to a cattle fair in the next shire, Daniel decided to skirt the deserted village and jog across the glen instead.He was winded, but exhilarated, by the time he reached his favorite fishing spot a half-hour later. As he'd expected, the area was deserted, a serene bower, with only the sounds of nature to keep company with him. A goshawk circled overhead, presumably looking for a meal, and the lush green heath that covered the hillside seemed to Daniel to be basking in the sun's warm, yellow glow now that the last snows of spring had finally melted. Birds twittered in the pine forest that bordered either side of the loch, and woodland creatures foraged for treats in the dew-coated grass just beyond the water's banks. Inhaling deeply, he became intoxicated on the fresh pine-scented air as it expanded his lungs. He held it inside himself a moment before slowly releasing it back into the cool, moist atmosphere around him. When he at last squatted down at the loch's edge and cast out the fishing line, he grinned at the circles of small waves his fly created as it broke the serenity of the water's surface. As he continued casting out the line in quick succession, patiently awaiting his first catch of the day, he nibbled on one of the bannock cakes.After two hours, he'd eaten them all and had caught seven medium-sized trout, which was plenty to feed the few members of the household that had remained behind. Deciding to pack up his kit and go back home, he gathered his belongings together and had only just turned to leave when a sound of thunder broke his reverie.Thinking he was about to be caught in a cloudburst, he looked up just as he felt a terrible rumbling beneath him, accompanied by the roar of men's voices coming from just beyond the rise. A shiver of foreboding ran through him as he whipped his head around. His eyes shot wide. There, directly where his family's fortress and the village lay, ominous gray and white smoke billowed. Dread, like a vise, pushed the air from his lungs. His heart pounding painfully in his chest, he dropped his fishing pole.Mother! Grandfather!In the next second he was in motion. By instinct alone, he picked up his rod and headed away from the sound of the charging men. Tall and lanky, his spindly legs churned as his long, narrow feet flew across the heath and into the cover of trees that lined the loch.He'd barely entered the dark canopy and fallen down to his knees, when an army of naked men on horseback came charging over the rise, covered in the blue war paint of the ancient Highlanders. Their eyes shone like eery white marble orbs through the cerulean tint on their faces, and the gore of recent battle coated their bodies and their horses. Some of the men were brandishing their blood-drenched swords high above their heads while others were carrying the fire spikes they'd used to set the blazes.The leader of the brigands swung a bloody spike with a human head attached to the end of it.\"Make haste. To the loch! We must wash off this woad and be on our way before the other MacLaurin soldiers return.\"Fearful tears gathered in Daniel's eyes, blurring his vision, before he manfully swiped them away with the back of his hand. He must see the faces of the men who'd done this deed. But there was so much blood! More than he'd seen in his life. His innards twisted at the sight. Covering his mouth with both hands, he swallowed hard, nearly choking, in an effort to keep from spewing out the sour bile and recently consumed bannocks that now threatened to rise up from his churning insides. After a moment, his stomach settled a bit and his eyes were drawn once more to the leader, and then to the grotesque and mutilated head on the spike. The blue devils were still too far away for him to see which of his clansmen had come to such a vile end.Without warning, his gut violently convulsed, causing him to lose the battle to keep his food down. It was all he could do to release the meal from its moorings and stay quiet enough to remain undiscovered by the men.Fearing for his family, but driven to stay until he'd seen the faces of his enemies, Daniel remained hidden and carefully silent.The men at last reached the banks of the loch, giving him a clear view of them for the first time. A chill shot up his spine as his mind interpreted what his eyes beheld. Several of the brigands were fully aroused. With bone-deep panic spurring his heart to hammer against his ribs, he tilted his head, straining to hear their boastful banter as they washed off the evidence of their violence. Tho' they spoke in the tongue of the Highlands, their accents were unusual and their speech, stilted. 'Twas clearly not their native tongue. As their visages were slowly revealed, they made crude comparisons of the women they had forced themselves upon, laughing and taunting each other as if it were some game of sport they'd been about. A shudder of pure loathing ran through Daniel.He turned his gaze back to the leader, who was still on one knee at the edge of the loch, washing off the slaughter gore. The man was tall, standing head and shoulders above many of the men under his command, with a medium, muscular frame, and reddish-brown hair that was a bit long, even by Highlander standards. It hung in a blood-matted braid down his back, ending at the base of his spine. Daniel's fists clenched.Turn a bit more to the left, you merciless fiend so I can at last know my enemy!", "related": ["B007RB318S"], "rank": 32067, "title": "THE DARKEST DAY : Highland Vengeance : Part One (A Family Saga / Adventure Romance) (Highland Vengeance: A Serial Novel)", "author": "K.E.

She is currently at work on the final draft of a fantasy novel, The War’s End, and its sequel, The Guardian. Like Plaguewalker, both novels involve a great deal of walking in the cold, one of her favorite pastimes and the place where she hears her characters best.

His work has been published in 56 countries, a dozen languages, several hundred reprint editions with over 1.1 million copies of his books currently in print.With the Ramayana Series® Banker embarked on a massively ambitious publishing project he calls the Epic India Library. Returning to the roots of the great ancient tales that have inspired countless authors and filmmakers, Banker sought to reclaim the original stories through a series of multi-volume retellings as well as original fiction and non-fiction. The Krishna Coriolis series, of which the first three books have been published, and the Mahabharata Series (of which this book is the first in an 18-volume series) are part of this project..Ashok Banker is credited with having heralded the resurgence of public interest in Indian mythology, for being the author of the first Indian TV series in English and co-writer of the first Malaysian TV series in English, and author of the first Indian e-book, among other firsts. He is one of the few living Indian authors whose contribution to Indian literature is acknowledged in The Picador Book of Modern Indian Writing and The Vintage Anthology of Indian Literature.Ashok is 48 years old and lives with his family in Mumbai. One of the most interactive Indian authors, he is always accessible to his readers via his blog and official website.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is admirably clear, and very accurate about evolution. It should convince any unbiased reader of the fact that there is overwhelming evidence for evolution, and that Darwinian natural selection is the major cause of evolutionary change.\" (Professor Brian Charlesworth F.R.S., Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh)\" Your students are lucky indeed. This is the clearest, most comprehensive and accessible compact account of science that I have seen. I was amazed by your clarity of thought and your comprehension of many subjects that come from diverse areas of science, philosophy, and history. You have really avoided almost all the pitfalls that even the most experienced scholars fall into at times. Really a wonderful treatment.\" (Professor Kevin Padian, Department of Integrative Biology & Museum of Palaeontology, University of California at Berkeley)\" I would make this book required reading for all students entering University science courses\". (Dr. Robert Old, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick)\" Many authors, such as Dawkins, Dennett and Grayling, have discussed at length various aspects of religion and its conflict with the logic of science. In this excellent book, John Ellis ignores the moral and societal aspects of the science/religion argument and instead concentrates on exploring the way science works, and the way it doesn't, in the context of biological evolution. It clearly sets out the fundamental principles of science and how they differ from a simple deference to authority, the basis of all religions. It then examines in detail the Darwinian framework for evolution by natural selection, and the numerous lines of evidence that, independently, overwhelmingly support the theory. This is, quite simply, the best and most easily understood presentation of the arguments I have ever read.\" (Dr. Geoff Oxford, Department of Biology, University of York)\" I have just had the very enjoyable and instructive experience of reading your 'How Science Works', and think that it is exactly the kind of thing that should be sent to every school and indeed every school pupil, not to say every university student too, in the country. I hope it is! and write to applaud its clarity and organisation, and the way it grips attention from the opening words.\" (Professor Anthony Grayling, School of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, London)\"I read your manuscript with interest, and thought it was a clear and precise introduction to evolution.\" (Professor Steve Jones, Department of Genetics University College London)“Ellis (emer., Univ. of Warwick, UK) … provides an excellent treatment of science in general and evolution in particular. His thesis … can be understood by most readers, even those without a background in science. His masterful treatment of evolution includes carefully selected illustrations and discussions of historical aspects. … serve as a teaching resource, which it is, but it is also an excellent introductory reference for most audiences.

Yet he seems to make the strongest case for fostering tolerance of other religions, while implementing Christian doctrine and maintaining Christian identity, through a single personal story. His brother offers to move some furniture into his new apartment and decides to play a practical joke, flooding the bathroom with several hundred balloons. McLaren must enlist the help of a neighbor boy to invite a virtual parade of children into the apartment to carry away the balloons. The resulting friendship between the Christian author and the Muslim boy provides an essential life lesson about loving our neighbors and tolerating their differences. McLaren makes additional valid points about the need to accept others and their various faiths while not compromising on Christian identity, but this particular anecdote leaves by far the most lasting impression. For Christians on the fence about whether to accept others and their faiths or to insist that only Christianity can adequately serve, this book provides important insights. --Susan DeGrane", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bastion is a frog and lives a carefree existence in Covington, not really doing a great deal. But along comes the sprite Larien with a worrying tale of snakes and a dark wizard. Bastion is most perplexed but soon learns the truth after he meets Delathalion, the Lord of the Castle Brackenbridge that he used to serve. Delathalion is now a turtle and it seems that perhaps Bastion has not always been a frog. The good wizard Melena has been helping to protect Bastion and his friends but cannot do so much longer. Bastion must act now to protect Covington. Youngsters will be enthralled by this story. It is exciting and suspenseful but not too scarily so. And although it is a fairy tale, it is not an overly straightforward 'happy ever after' one. The plot is intriguing and keeps readers guessing. The characters are superb. There are brave ones, grumpy ones, mysterious ones, good ones, and wicked ones. Bastion is a slightly flawed hero. He is happy to take the easy option, at least at first, where guarding his town consists of snoozing in the sun with a fishing line tied to his toe to make people think he is actually awake!

His mother typed it out and was so shocked by the language and violent content of the story that very little of the shocking element remained. He studied English, Drama and Sociology at the University of Northampton, and sometime after that qualified as an Occupational Therapist at Oxford Brookes University. Paul also inadvertently walked across a minefield whilst doing voluntary work in Lebanon, probably the stupidest thing he’s ever done. He is a member of the Northampton Science Fiction Writers’ Group and has had short stories published in various magazines, and the anthology Shoes, Ships & Cadavers alongside authors such as Ian Watson and Sarah Pinborough. His short stories Fearworld and Necroforms are available from Greyhart Press. So too is Babel, set in the same universe as Terminus and something of a sequel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This approach to learning and instruction represents a new brand of constructivist learning in a more structured learning environment compared to conventional PBL. This book contains a series of chapters by authors with first-hand experience in the one-day,one-problem PBL approach. Unlike other books on PBL, the chapters are both research-informed and practical. Results of empirical studies into the factors of PBL such as quality of problems, tutor behaviours, scaffoldings, student learning and interest are discussed together with practical implications for the educator.", "related": [], "rank": 5096281, "title": "One-Day, One-Problem", "author": "Glen O'Grady", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book is as good a summary statement as any of 'McKinnonomics.'  Well worth reading as always.\"--Barry Eichengreen, George C. Pardee & Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science, University of California, Berkeley\"Ron McKinnon has written a masterful summary of the attractiveness of the U.S. dollar to foreign central banks and investors, and why the dollar standard has survived and flourished despite the challenges from the SDR, the Euro, the Japanese yen, and presumably the Chinese yuan. Government institutions and investors in Europe, Latin America, and Asia buy U.S. dollar securities because these purchases satisfy their interests; the 'dollar is the best game in town'. The paradox is that the U.S. payments deficit is a sign of the strength of the U.S. dollar.\"-- Robert Z. Aliber, Professor of International Economics and Finance Emeritus, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago\"Ron McKinnon is an original thinker, an iconoclast who always challenges the conventional wisdom, and never more so than in this latest book.  He argues that the Fed should aim to stabilize the dollar's exchange rate, and that their current policy to push down interest rates to the zero lower bound has been wrong, both for the USA and for the wider world.  His arguments may not find favour, but they are cogently and forcefully presented.  This book should be a goad for policymakers and a stimulus for everyone else.\"--Professor Charles Goodhart, Emeritus Professor of Banking and Finance, London School of Economics\"McKinnon presents an analysis reflecting insights gained over a lifetime's distinguished career as an academic and a consultant. ... Through sophisticated and subtle analysis supported by empirical data graphically presented, he concludes that the persistent deficits in the US balance of payments are not a product of exchange rate distortions but rather of a national savings deficit. ...

She was written 12 years ago. It is the first piece of work I have written to completion. Many projects I have begun and just as many I printed and placed neatly in a storage container for future attention. After Hurricane Katrina lifted the lid on my box and my home and blew my works all over my back yard I gathered as many of the waterlogged pages as I could and placed them back in the container. This was one of the works I could not salvage but was one I felt in the deepest part of my soul. One evening as I laid down to sleep it came into my mind. It was that same night that I was awakened by my one year old at 2:00 a.m. The voice of 'A Vintage Memory' was still there and wanted to be heard. I rewrote this book non stop until I felt it said everything it wanted to say. It is my wish that this story touches you in the same place from which it was originated in me.Sincerely,Krystal Tillman", "related": [], "rank": 4246141, "title": "A Vintage Memory", "author": "Krystal Tillman", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

M. Beach is a lecturer at the University of Texas, San Antonio. He has advanced degrees in English, History, Philosophy, and Education.  Beach's scholarly research focuses on several distinct, but interrelated subjects: The philosophy of knowledge, the science of culture and social institutions, the history and philosophy of education, and literature.   Beach began investing in 1998.  At first, he gave his money to financial advisers.  These “experts” gave Beach bad advice and largely ignored his financial needs.  Beach wisely invested a small portion of his savings, but foolishly bought equities at historic highs.  He watched his portfolio dramatically decrease in value due to the busting tech bubble of 1999 and the busting housing bubble of 2007.  Disgusted with the poor advice of experts, Beach foolishly sold his investments at the wrong time (2000 and 2007).  After his second financial crisis, Beach sat on his cash in low-risk fixed income vehicles.  Wisely, Beach began to study economics and financial markets before making another investment decision.  Beach also decided never to trust his portfolio to a financial “expert” again.  By using his knowledge of economics, financial history, and human psychology, Beach recognized the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of a stock market crash in late 2008.  He incrementally invested his life savings in the stock market, waited out the panic lows of 2009 (with knots in his stomach and fear in his heart), and was rewarded with a return of 300% by the spring of 2010. He continues to implement his investment plans, making (and loosing) money over the short-term, but focused on long-term gains.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes that learning and experiencing life is an art form, a gateway to transcend and express abstract dreams into concrete realities, having an opportunity to leave a unique impression on others, changing their lives by seeking answers to the same questions she has had in life--to question things for herself, to find alternative answers, to go back to nature, and encourages her readers to do the same in their lives.Carrie is a bestselling author of several books, including \"The Essay Tutor\", \"Bodymorphosis: A Mind and Body Curriculum\", \"Patience through Perspective\", \"Simplify and Beautify Your Life with Natural Coconut Oil\", and \"The Home Spa Book.\"In addition to writing, Carrie has served as an instructor and tutor of English and writing at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The case vignettes, alone, are useful source material for teaching medical trainees on what can go wrong and how to deal with it when it does.” (Harvey Marcovitch, Clinical Risk journal)“This is a tremendous exercise in critical thinking skills, i.e. the ability to think through differential diagnoses and longer-term consequences beyond the simple facts presented. This book has great learning value for young and midcareer clinicians to help them hone their diagnostic skills.”  (Doody’s, 5 July2013)\"This excellent 182-page book is designed for general practitioners in their early years. It will be a very useful source for all involved in teaching and mentoring those in general practice, and should, I think, be compulsory reading for all practice managers. It is so packed with information, concepts and case studies written in decent English that I found it difficult to put down.Thefirst sectiongives a resume of the law concerning breach of medical duty, including the Bolam test. Causation, damages and time limits for litigation are discussed. Protocols, guidelines and communications are considered followed by a heart felt appeal to learn from system failures. This is what I want practice managers to read.Thenext sectionlooks at how an initial diagnosis is reached, and then refined. Avoiding being misled by first impressions by testing against a differential diagnosis, excluding diagnoses that must not be missed, considering non-fitting facts, and follow up review all help. Making arrangements to review the case if the illness does not follow the expected course can retrieve the situation, and a record of this can save a reputation.Communication is recognised as the core of safe practice. I like the simple concept “Ask yourself whether a colleague could work out from your notes the essential details of the consultation.”Then follows the real meat of the book. This consists offorty recent clinical cases, each demonstrating a particular mishap. These forty cases bring up 95% of causes of complaints against general practitioners. Each describes a case in a few well-chosen sentences, and asks the reader what they think, and might do next. For example, make a differential diagnosis, or perform further simple examinations. An expert opinion is then given on what good practice would involve. This is followed by a legal opinion of the case, including the likely range of damages or settlement. Some of the sums are unnerving! Each case takes up just two pages.The book ends with the various enquiries and courts that may be faced, and practical advice on addressing them.I sincerely hope that other practitioners and practice managers will find this little book as thought provoking as I have.\" (Daniel Haines, FRCGP, MFFLM.)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sadly, that same year I was\nintroduced to yet another statistical anomaly... ...I was in the bottom quartile of bowling\naverages in the league--which meant I was part of the 25% that made the upper\n75% possible. Whether you know it or not, we are defined and\ndriven by statistics. We may not describe ourselves as members of the middle\nclass, or proud parents of 2.3 children, but businesses and governments attach\na great deal of significance to these classifications, and use these\ndescriptive statistics to add a semblance of order and reason to their social\nprograms and marketing campaigns.In the business world we use these same statistical methods to measure success and failure, compare ourselves to the competition, and assess the potential for future growth. Given the significance of elementary statistics in the field of business management, I can think of no single business related subject that can enhance your managerial skills as quickly as a course in statistics.

I admit that back then, it was a lot like the pledge of allegiance or some nursery rhyme. It was something often said quickly, making sure I got the words right, but not fully understanding what I was saying.Unfortunately, even today, I sometimes am in church and someone will ask us all to repeat The Lord's Prayer together, and I'll just go through the words by rote. I suspect many of us do. However, about 20 years ago, I began to teach the Lord's Prayer differently. I began to go slowly through it and discuss each part with my students.I know, there are books out there that look at the Lord's Prayer as a \"model prayer.\" This is true up to a point. However, if we try too hard to copy the prayer's pattern, we may still miss the richness of its message.Jesus isn't creating a model prayer, but an example of how to pray in a broader sense of the word. He is teaching us about what prayer is all about. First, we meet God as father, then as heavenly king. We seek his will before we seek his gifts. We ask his forgiveness, but pledge to forgive others as well. We recognize that we are sinners prone to temptation. We also acknowledge our provision comes solely from him.Rushing through the prayer, even if it is \"our\" prayer built on its framework, takes us further away from God than drawing closer to him. I hope these lessons draw you closer to God by having a deeper understanding of prayer as a living conversation with God rather than just a ritual to be followed.", "related": ["B00BI5EO3U"], "rank": 1396562, "title": "Teach Us to Pray: A Bible Study on the Lord's Prayer (Wordmaster Bible Study Library)", "author": "Terri Main", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

W. Francisco III is the senior pastor of Calvary Community Church, and presiding bishop of Calvary Covenant Ministries Inc., an organization which provides spiritual oversight and counsel, as well as ministerial and administrative support to churches throughout the United States and abroad. In October of 1990, after much counsel with his spiritual father, Bishop L.W. Francisco II, Francisco entered full-time ministry along with his wife Natalie as Senior Pastors, and the ministry grew rapidly under their leadership. Calvary Community began to enter into several ministries: radio, television, print media and the formation of Calvary Christian Academy, a pre-school and elementary school that seeks to Nurture, Educate and Empower Our Youth to be Successful World Changers. Francisco has not only been called by God to pastor the local church, but to also help other pastors and leaders reach their full potential in Christ. He has an avid passion to see the body of Christ educated, liberated and empowered to fulfill the Kingdom mandate. Francisco earned a Bachelor of Arts in Ministry from International Bible College & Seminary in Independence, MO., and a Master of Arts as well as a Doctorate of Ministry from Carolina University of Theology.

Preferring to tutor himself now, he has learned various languages to assist him while travelling and is fluent in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French and Gaelic. After leaving his home village of Gateside by Beith in Ayrshire in 1983, he moved to Troon, and in 1995 went to the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides and livssssed in the town of Stornoway until 2005 when he returned to Gourock where he is currently residing. After having back-packed and travelled all over the world, mainly by himself, he now prefers to divide his time travelling between his home in Scotland and his house on La Isla de la Juventud in Cuba. His interests are writing comedy, travelling and photography. This is his first book and would make a good travel companion for the solo pilgrim traveller. It's about the life of an ordinary man who has seen the world for himself, pulled a trick or two and never got stuck in the quick-sand because he had an escape route. That's the appeal of the book, a companion for those of you who want to travel the world, broaden your horizons and make life a playground for enjoyment.

The stories in his book, Loose Ends: Short Stories Started During the Vietnam War (Moki Lane, 210 pp., $19.95, paper), are mostly lighthearted, semi-autobiographical tales of Seabees in the Vietnam War. Death, however, often intrudes. The hero, Henry James Barthochowski, nicknamed Cow, is a sort of stand-in for the author. He is stationed in Quang Tri. The book s hero, like the author, did two tours in Vietnam before turning twenty-one. This is that rare Vietnam War book of fiction that not only mentions General Westmoreland, but contains an entire story with the general as the main character a story in which Westmoreland is making his exit from Vietnam after guiding the war since 1964. Cow, our Seabee hero, is near the bottom of the military food chain. He realizes that his orders are to defeat the Viet Cong and stop the spread of communism, as the general points out to the troops, but he s skeptical that a difference was being made and the war was being won, as Westmoreland wanted the troops to believe. The fictional main character is one of my favorite figures in the literature of the Vietnam War. He is mild, eternal, and as memorable as Yossarian in Catch-22. The stories in Loose Ends, in fact, teach us many of the same lessons about war that Catch-22 tried to teach us. Americans seem to need these lessons taught over and over, and yet they still never seem to learn. I guess we are slow learners about the futility of war.  Loose Ends was an eye-opener. Until I read it, I knew little or nothing about the role of the Seabees in the Vietnam War. Now I know. Every story brings home the daily life of a lowly enlisted Seabee in Quang Tri and DaNang; whether he is driving a truck, standing guard, welding a water tank, or doing any of the myriad duties that the low-level Navy man must do. Many of them, of course, are hens end duties that put him in constant threat of conflict with lifers who are more an adversary than the VC or the NVA. Much of the book involves monkey business as only young men can make it. Said monkey business is always fun to read about. Henry James Barthochowski will always live in my memory because the author brings him alive on every page. This Wisconsin farm boy in the Navy in Vietnam is a listener, observer, and anything but a cheerleader for military decorum. His observations lead him to conclude that the theater of war is more the theater of the absurd.  The story that makes this point best is the one in which Cow is showering and three pretty Vietnamese girls come in to clean the shower room. They giggle and pretend they don t see him. Funny stuff. The same thing happened to me in Vietnam at Tan Son Nhut more than once. Cow s homecoming is also familiar. He comes back to his small town in Wisconsin and is castigated for his long hair, quickly grown when he returns to college. The local American Legion lets him know that they do not want him as a member as he had not been to a real war. Vietnam, to the members of the Greatest Generation, was merely a conflict. Guadalcanal was part of a real war. We encounter Agent Orange, ham and lima beans, barrel-burning details, and short-timers calendars. I was sad to learn that Navy guys did not have it as cushy as we Army guys always liked to believe they did. They do have a commanding officer witty enough to use a recording of the Animals We Gotta Get out of This Place, for morning reveille. That beats anything in the Army I served in. But I would still rather do one tour in Vietnam with the Army than two with the Navy. I learned that much from this fine and funny book. Read it, and you will learn plenty too, and have more than few laughs. --David Willson Vietnam Veterans of America Veterans Books Review II on the Web: April 4, 2014Loose Ends ties reality to Vietnam experience. Book Review By Ed Byrne. Loose Ends: Short Stories Started During The Vietnam War By Jim Zitzelsberger. Hilbert native Jim Zitselsberger wrote the novel Cry for the Water Buffalo in 2010 and it won strong acclaim for its accuracy in depicting the Vietnam War as a civil war, telling it both from an American and a Vietnamese perspective. American veterans of the Vietnam War gave it deep praise for being true to the experience. But Loose Ends may be an even better book about the American experience in Vietnam, following the experiences of members of the Navy Seabees and of a Wisconsin Seabee in particular. The stories carry experiences that are often humorous and sometimes tragic and heartbreaking. Zitzelsberger, a retired Oshkosh public school teacher, has relatives in Hilbert and Greenleaf. But the local angle isn t what makes this book attractive. It is Zitzelsberger's ability to find the truth in little things and let the big picture develop naturally. The book takes a young man named Cow after all, he comes from a small rural community in Wisconsin through his tour of duty in a muddy outpost in a dirty and, for the U.S., unwinnable war. Zitzelsberger chooses words as a surgeon chooses incisions. His description of a C-47 gunship is beyond accurate: 'With guns blazing and buzzing like a rattlesnake s tail, the tongue of the fire-breathing monster stretched all the way to the ground in what looked like one solid red line.' On Cow remembering events from his childhood after seeing a report on the death of a soldier he grew up with: 'Baseball and the 8th grade, odd things to think about here and now, thought Cow. Then he said aloud to no one in particular, How do you figure? How do kids in elementary school get from baseball games to here and never back to bat again?' This is the stuff of which honest tears are formed. His summary of a scam perpetrated by the SeaBee unit, where they gave one of their two tire-changing machines to some Marines in exchange for jungle boots that wouldn't rot out: 'It was a good deal all around. The Marines were happy to have a tire-changing machine; the new boots looked and felt good; the Company Commander was proud of his outfit; and, because the two machines worked so well, the tire crew had less work to do and more time not to do it.' I was trying to think of a better, more honest, book about war. But I could not, and this one is a portrait of what war is like from within the battle lines. The book is available at Amazon.com in both a paperback edition and a Kindle edition.

Voulant vérifier l'adage selon lequel « le droit mène à tout, à condition d'en sortir », mes efforts d'évasion furent récompensés en 2008 par une reconversion dans le multimédia, principalement en production de jeux vidéos et d'applications mobiles. J'ai eu le plaisir de participer à la création d'une dizaine de titres depuis et de baigner dans un milieu créatif et déjanté, troquant le costume pour le jeans ! J'ai baigné, depuis mon enfance, dans un mélange de cultures, d'influences et d'expériences qui m'ont permis de satisfaire un trait fondamental de mon caractère: la curiosité ! L'humour et le refus de se prendre au sérieux font également partie intégrante de ma personnalité: le plaisir de faire des bons mots, spirituels, ou pas, je l'ai hérité de ma grand-mère. C'est finalement toute cette expérience de vie, aussi bien professionnelle que personnelle, qui m'a finalement amené à me lancer dans l'écriture de roman... Sauf que... L'envie était là, pas le déclic. Jusqu'à ce fameux matin ou les personnages que j'avais en tête depuis un petit moment se mirent à prendre vie: la série des aventures de Rossetti & MacLane était née ! Placée sous le signe des nouvelles technologies (naturellement), de l'humour (évidemment) et du suspense (forcément), on assiste à la naissance d'une complicité entre deux êtres qui auraient très bien pu ne jamais se rencontrer et vont pourtant former un duo très efficace !", "related": ["B00640K2AI"], "rank": 243897, "title": "Jeux dangereux (Rossetti & MacLane t. 1) (French Edition) eBook", "author": "Jérôme Dumont", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But we can't simply plug new devices into old classrooms. In Breakthrough Leadership in the Digital Age, Hess and Saxberg make it clear that we can only fully leverage the educational possibilities of technology if we are willing to become \"learning engineers\" first, and redesign our schools, classrooms, and teaching practices to take full advantage of these tools. This will require bold leadership and dramatic changes to the way we structure our school day, train our educators, and deliver instruction. This book is an important part of the conversation about what it means to education children in the 21st century.\"(Joshua P. Starr, Ed. D., Superintendent)\"Hess and Saxberg offer a powerful read for principals as the chief 'learning engineers' in schools. Instructional leaders know that technology has changed the complexion of schools and classrooms, but their leadership is needed to steward its use to solve learning challenges.  Principals are becoming masters of navigating programs, gadgets, and curricula to best utilize resources. Applying the principles of learning science to these leadership competencies will deepen the level of thinking about technology, and lead to more meaningful student outcomes.By deconstructing learning science and making the connection to technology, the authors have outlined key strategies for school leaders as they work to transform traditional practices in schools. The insights and ideas put forth by Hess and Saxberg will help principals implement myriad practices that fully realize the potential of technology and digital learning.Whether it is whole-school reform or targeted interventions, principals will be motivated to rethink or 're-engineer' the use of technology to optimize teaching and learning.\"(Gail Connelly, Executive Director)\"Breakthrough Leadership in the Digital Age provides clear insights and thoughtful design to help schools understand that the main thing with technology is not the technology; it is what you do with it. The authors provide a powerful example vital to the understanding of creating classrooms that are full of ‘learning engineers’ including teachers and students.\"(Mark Edwards, Superintendent)\"Hess & Saxberg are spot on about the right future for the role of science and technology in education.  They wonderfully combine an enthusiasm for new and creative approaches with a clear-minded 'does it really work?' skepticism.  This book presents the most clear argument I have seen that learning science can make a huge difference in improving student learning and lowering costs.\"(Ken Koedinger, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction and Psychology)\"Technology alone will not improve teaching or learning in our schools. However, as Hess and Saxberg have succinctly lain out, if leveraged properly by effective educators, technology can and will have a profound impact on the educational landscape. It is important that all education stakeholders embrace this way of thinking in order to effectively move technology use in schools beyond just quantity of devices to quality of learning experiences.\"(Josh Stumpenhorst, Junior High Teacher (2012 Illinois Teacher of the Year))\"As we educators expect our children to think deeply and critically about the world, around them, we should expect nothing less of ourselves. Here, Rick and Bror provide us with an outline for that thinking. They push us to ask the right questions as we challenge the conventional approaches to learning within our schools. This book is about far more than educational technology; it is a call to critical thought from an orientation that aims first and foremost to provide excellent learning opportunities for our children.\"(Mark Murphy, Secretary of Education)\"This is a \"must read\" book for educational leaders, policymakers, educational product developers and those of us who have a stake in our education system. While many books have described ways that educational technology can help save our K-12 education system, this book is different. Hess and Saxberg combine a realistic view of technology with an engaging and acurate description of what we know about learning sciences and a discussion abotu how to combine the two. Their concern is that technology is often a solution in search of a problem to solve--a solution that seems very seldom to bring expected benefits. They remind us with brief cautionary stories that different technologies are empty vehicles that are most often used to deliver educational products whose impact has ranged from destructive to ineffective--but also that occasionally their impact is positive and game-changing. They describe many popular but failed approaches that should be avoided because of solid evidence that they don't work. They also offer compelling examples to support their view that the best outcomes occus when forward-thinking school leaders combine solid, evidence-based learning strategies chosen to solve identified problems, with cost-effective technology. They describe the strategies they recommend. They offer clear and specific pointers about how to use these learning science based strategies and an engineering approach to create smart school reform (with and without technology).\"(Richard E. Clark, Professor Emeritus of Educational Psychology and Technology)\"Technology gives us the opportunity to customize education and meet student needs like never before. It's our moral imperative to avoid the next achievement gap between students who master technology and those who do not. Hess and Saxberg's vision for technology's integration into America's schools presents a powerful solution to some of the most important questions facing education leaders today.\"(Dr. Tony Bennett,  Former Florida Commissioner of Education)\"Everyone touching education—from educators to school leaders and from investors and philanthropists to entrepreneurs—needs to understand how to think like a learning engineer and read this book. Technology holds unbelievable promise to be a part of the solution to transform education, but it won’t happen unless all parties attack its implementation smartly. Digital Leadership points the way forward.\"(Michael B. Horn, Education Executive Director)\"Hess and Saxberg cut through the ed-tech hype and identify great instruction as the key to improved learning outcomes. Teachers, as well as school and district leaders, will find in these pages an effective blueprint for trying and deploying instructional technologies that is at once deeply conceptual and entirely practical.\"(Stacey Childress, Deputy Director of Education)\"Hess & Saxberg recognize that thoughtful use of technology in schools is not primarily technical nor technological – rather, it is human.  Or, as the old cartoon character Pogo said, I have seen the enemy, and it is me.  Breakthrough Leadership in the Digital Age is a must-read for education leaders who want to harness the possibility of new tools, and do so in a thoughtful way that makes a difference for learning.\"(Keith Krueger, CEO)\"The concept of a 'learning engineer' is nothing short of an overdue revolution in thinking about innovation in public education. Leaders across the educator sector, who are committed to improvement in service to kids, must resist the silver bullet promise of shiny new tools air-dropped into yesterday’s classrooms. Hess and Saxberg tell us why, and more importantly, how to squarely place people as the drivers of innovation. The pragmatic approach laid out in this book will help leaders recognize that kids need more than touch screens. They need teachers, school and district leaders, and policy makers who approach this work as entrepreneurial problem finders, thoughtfully applying technology as a solution when and where it makes sense.\"(Jennifer Medbery, Founder & CEO)\"It's not the tools, as Rick and Bror point out; it's the new potential to engineer engaging pathways to mastery, to leveraging great technology and buying time for teachers to build powerful sustained relationships with young people. Rick's attention to 'Cage-busting Leadership' and Bror's relentless demand for learning R&D make them great co-authors--and make this a must read.\"(Tom Vander Ark, Author & CEO)\"This important book urges readers to create powerful, new learning environments based on learning science. Technology can be transformative when we focus on actual learning experiences and not just the shiniest gadget.\"(Alex Hernandez, Partner)\"This book provides powerful insight into why state, civic, and system leaders should rethink policies, practices, and procedures related to technology and its usage in our classrooms. Too often, our current structures fail to promote and support learning engineering. Rick Hess and Bror Saxberg have designed a compelling guide for the road ahead.\"(William Hite, Superintendent)\"'Learning engineering,' the application of learning science to learning at scale, is likely to be a critical ingredient to make progress in on-line and on-the-ground education in the years to come. The use of technology in education is finally fulfilling its potential. Bror and Frederick are leading thinkers in this accelerating space.\"(Salman Khan, Founder & Executive Director)", "related": [], "rank": 1016379, "title": "Breakthrough Leadership in the Digital Age", "author": "Frederick M.

I write romance, suspense, and sci-fi.  I live in Central Florida with my sexy husband and our two little boy superheroes.  I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and I would have no idea what it would feel like to live far away from a beach.  I love the water, the sand, and the sun.  I went to college to be an archaeologist, and that is exactly what I did with the first decade of my adult life.   I studied Anthropology and Classics at Florida State University (where I met my sexy husband) and then went on and got my master’s degree in Applied Anthropology at The University of South Florida.   I love anthropology because it is the study of us.  Whether I was a student or an oral historian, or an archaeologist, or a GIS specialist, I was working with people, studying their behavior, and their impact on society.  I’ve always written, as a kid, as an academic, and now as a novelist.   My husband was in news until this past year.  He’s had some fun gigs—some I’ve gotten to tag along on, others I’ve just heard about.  Now he’s a mechanical engineer and finally using his giant math-genius for something useful. We love music and would probably go to concerts every weeked if we didn’t have kids, but we do, so we keep it to a handful a year.  Right now we are on a monster Mumford and Sons kick (even got to go to the Gentlemen of the Road Stopover this year!) and we’re so glad we got to see Imagine Dragons before they got super, crazy huge.  We love to travel (a lot), and eat.  Oh, and I also have a thing for reading.

Less than one percent of the diving community works with people with disabilities. A very small percentage of that adaptive dive community works with individuals with virtually any disability and only one organization does all of the above and promotes and facilitates adaptive scuba, the business of adaptive scuba and ground-breaking research surrounding scuba therapy, around the world. That organization is Diveheart.  After launching programs in China, Australia, Israel, the UK, all over the Caribbean and in more than two hundred cities around the U.S., Diveheart has inspired thousands of divers and instructors around the world to “Imagine the Possibilities” for individuals of all abilities in their communities. This has led to the creation of twenty additional non-profit organizations that Diveheart has helped to develop. These organizations work with individuals with disabilities and help spread the word about the power of adaptive scuba and scuba therapy. Diveheart’s work with children, adults and veterans with disabilities has led it to launch programs for children with autism in Israel, veterans with disabilities in the UK and active Marines and Navy corpsmen at Camp Pendleton and other military personnel at bases and veterans hospitals around the U.S.  Since 2001 Diveheart has been pioneering new and innovative training and adaptive diving techniques to make the Adaptive Dive experience safer and more fulfilling while growing the knowledge and experience base for adaptive buddies and instructors. The Diveheart Adaptive Diver Certification program represents the latest innovations in adaptive scuba techniques, training and thinking.

I was in such awe of this vivacious boy's confidence in himself, his loving and caring nature, and his many aspirations still waiting to be achieved. I knew in my heart that this boy was going to make it, he was going to achieve all his dreams.My sister had impacted Austin's life ... Austin, in turn, had impacted mine.

This text is an excellent resource that assists students on their journey into the fascinating field of Psychology, in a manner that is clear, informative and engaging.”--Kristen Buscaglia, Niagara College “The revised textbook is more streamlined, condensed and relevant to the material that is being taught in a college introduction class. The charts, reviews, concept maps, objectives, etc, are great tools that are incorporated throughout the text that add to the comprehension and tie the concepts together in a format that is appealing to all.”--Adele Caruso, Mohawk College “One distinct advantage that the new edition of the World of Psychology has is the Canadian content piece. Students want to know how psychology is relevant in the Canadian context and that they can also work with these subject areas. Another distinct advantage is the learning objectives for each module and proximity of the \"remember it\" section to the material they just read. The review and reflect section is also highly useful for the student and the instructor.”--Dahlia Nicholson, George Brown College “Some instructors may be more hesitant than their students to adopt a purely magazine-style text, as it may not seem scholarly or traditional enough. I think your text [Wood,World of Psychology] provides a good alternative because it incorporates many elements of a magazine-style text, while still retaining the scholarly integrity that most instructors demand.”--Elaine Nethery, Seneca College “[Wood is] student-focussed, organized and easy to read. This text provides thought-provoking questions while also providing the content to come up with the answers.

It's not your typical fantasy story, or your typical lesbian story, or even your typical kink story for that matter. For me, it sits in the adventurous nexus of blade swinging, magic making, personal growth and kinky sex. This means it falls between a lot of stools, and ends up rolling around on the tavern floor, swiping dropped coins and swearing at passers by.Lesbia is not a place for those seeking an ideal world. (Unless your ideal world consists of hard handed warriors spanking deserving bottoms, in which case, it totally is.) But it's certainly not aspirational fiction. The heroines, even the popular ones, are far from perfect.Reed, the central character in Virgin City, is probably one of my favorites so far. She's a strong willed, independent woman who is managing as best she can in a world she doesn't quite fit into the way others do. Yes, she can hit the reset button on creation, but that doesn't mean she feels at home in it. Her path is not an easy one. Her powers are more of a curse than a blessing, even when she uses them for her own personal gain.In addition to Reed's internal struggles, she has to contend with the fact that everybody in Clitera City has their own agenda. Reed has found something of a home with the outcasts of Clitera, a group known derisively as the Ratlings, but among those grasping thieves she cannot be entirely at peace. To deal with the realities of life, Reed takes refuge in a herbal haze. It's a temporary fix, but it offers some respite from the crushing grind.When a beautiful half-elf witch named Ayla shows up and insists she is there to take care of Reed, it's understandable that Reed is cynical. And when Reed loses her powers, she realizes just how small and vulnerable she really is in a world she can no longer command at will. The realization brings with it panic, rebellion, a full on flight from the very thing she's always desired.Reed's not the only one running. There's Rog, the idealist living in his dead brother's shadow, Callista, a widow who craves the hard hand of someone who can put limits on her sexually aggressive behavior, and Crispin, a mischievous power hungry elf very far from home.Clitera City is full of broken hearts and wounded souls. Ayla cannot save them all - but she might be able to save one.", "related": ["B00LVNCLWA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This evolution is different for stars of different masses. How stars end their lives when their supply of energy is exhausted also depends on their masses. Interestingly, astronomers conjectured about the ultimate fate of the stars even before the details of their evolution became clear. Part I of this book gives an account of the remarkable predictions made during the 1920s and 1930s concerning the ultimate fate of stars. Since much of this development hinged on quantum physics that emerged during this time, a detailed introduction to the relevant physics is included in the book. Part II is a summary of the life history of stars. This discussion is divided into three parts: low-mass stars, like our Sun, intermediate-mass stars, and massive stars. Many of the concepts of contemporary astrophysics were built on the foundation erected by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in the 1930s. This book, written during his birth centenary, includes a brief biographical sketch of the brilliant scientist, which readers will find fascinating.Reading this book will get young students excited about the presently unfolding revolution in astronomy and the challenges that await them in the world of physics, engineering and technology. General readers will also find the book appealing for its highly accessible narrative of the physics of stars.  This book is a companion volume of “What are the Stars?” by the same author.\"I know of no other book on the evolution of stars of a similar scope and breadth that is so accessible for undergraduate students.\"E P J van den HeuvelProfessor of AstrophysicsWinner of the Spinoza and Descartes PrizesUniversity of Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "related": [], "rank": 2753826, "title": "Life and Death of the Stars (Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics)", "author": "Ganesan Srinivasan", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She sleeps in a fairy bed, lifted high in the air, and upon waking, she enjoys stabbing people with tiny needles, over and over, under the guise of making pretty pictures on their skin. She paints dark images on canvases in a cave-like studio carved out of the side of a cliff, and beautiful murals on the walls of her home directly above. She's happiest with her nose buried in a book, or in her laptop as she writes her novels.  She is the author of several books, including the Godhunter series, Feeding the Lwas, The Magic of Fabric, Enchantress, and Bargains of the Heart. She's been writing since she was a little girl but first decided to pursue writing as a career when she gave her High School English teacher one of her books to critique and unbeknownst to her, that teacher passed her book around to all of her friends. A month later she was accosted in the halls by a teacher she didn't know, begging her to write a sequel. She's been writing novels ever since. She enjoys serious, kick-ass heroines in her literature. \"Nothing is more endearing than a woman who goes up against overwhelming supernatural odds with a sense of humor,\" she says. \"Who wouldn't want to be that woman? I want to be that woman. So that's who I write about, the woman I want to be and the men I want to be with.\" Her main characters are strong, witty women, who in the midst of trauma will crack a joke, or find the nerve to sass a villain even when they know it's not in their best interest. Add to that, strong male characters who aren't intimidated or emasculated by the main heroine's strength and you have a dynamic partnership. Amy's books aren't about women being more powerful than men or subjugating men in any way, they're about women who can be strong and yet want their men to have their own strengths as well. More importantly, her heroines have humility and weaknesses that make them not only believable but easy to relate to.", "related": ["B00GVKMCOK"], "rank": 112203, "title": "Perchance To Die (Book 12 in The Godhunter Series)", "author": "Amy Sumida", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
