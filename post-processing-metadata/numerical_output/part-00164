When Jacob becomes ill, Reisa must  leave him in the care of two Confederate veterans while she and  Dov earn enough money to help him. As they are returning to  Jacob, they find a man unconscious in the ditch and take him  home with them.

Most Americans-96 percent, to be exact- are somehow involved in the arts, whether as audience participants, hobbyists, or via broadcast recording, video, or the Internet. The contribution of the arts to the U.S. economy is stunning: the nonprofit arts industry alone contributes over 857 billion dollars per year, and American artists enjoy world-class status.Despite its size, quality, and economic impact, the arts community is not articulate about how to serve the public interest, and few citizens have an appreciation of the many public policies that influence American arts and culture. The contributors to this volume argue that U.S. policy does and should continue to support the arts; as they sere a broad, not merely an elite, public. Support for the arts and culture is good economic and trade policy and contributes to the quality of life and community, while it sustains the creativity of American artists and organizations.Contents: - Mapping the Public Life of the Arts in America, Joni M.

(\"When Jesus invites us to join him, the Cross is embossed at the very center of the invitation,\" he writes.) These sermons, however, may be even more direct than his memoirs. Their organization, according to the 14 stations of the cross, underscores Bernardin's constant focus on the most basic aspects of the gospel stories and spotlights his ability to draw contemporary lessons from these ancient stories. Even more impressive is the trustworthy tension between confidence and humility that characterizes Bernardin's messages to his flock. One sermon concludes, \"Accepting the fact of alienation is the equivalent of embracing the Cross each day, as Jesus himself did.\"The Journey to Peaceis full of such forthright, realistic, and faithful reflections.--Michael Joseph Gross", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The room was not much more than a supersized closet, but it was her own space and she loved every crowded inch of it.She made her way past two cartons of new textbooks sent by publishers to be considered for adoption, eased into the wooden chair at her desk, leaned back, closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Ten quiet minutes; that was all she needed to regroup and replenish her sagging energy.It was only noon, but she had already taught four classes, met with her supervisor for her annual performance review and had a parent conference. By hiding here and managing the paperwork that was only a part of her duties as the language-arts department head at Welleswood High School, she might be able to finish the school day in peace. In quiet. And without interruption. She sighed, fully hopeful her plan would work.Until the telephone rang.She opened one eye, stared at the offending instrument and wondered if there was an alarm attached under her chair that alerted the outside world that she finally had some downtime. When the telephone continued to ring, she opened her other eye, resisted the urge to answer and let out another sigh.Just once, she would love to have ten minutes to unwind after changing hats from classroom teacher to department head. She had been the language-arts department head here for seven years now, but she had been teaching here for over thirty-five years. From experience, however, she knew that the pace of the school year was rapidly heating up now that March had arrived, and peace and quiet would be very precious commodities.At the moment, she didn't want to think about the school-board election next month or whether the community would vote to accept or reject next year's budget. Nor did she want to think about the pressure she would soon be under from parents eager to make sure their children were recommended for advanced classes next year. But she did have to think about parent conferences scheduled for that evening, which made for an extra-long day today and an extra-tired day tomorrow, a Friday. Fortunately, she had the weekend to recover, and she looked forward to spending two very quiet, very peaceful days at home, grading the mini research papers she had collected this week.The telephone continued to ring. Apparently, the caller was not giving up, but Ellie, just as determined to finish her paperwork before the parent conferences tonight, was letting the call go to voice mail. This year's senior awards for the department had to be reviewed and organized for her supervisor, and if she didn't make a plan to ration the department's supplies, they would run out long before June.When the telephone finally stopped ringing, then started up again less than a minute later, she let out one final sigh, gave in and reached for the receiver. \"No peace today,\" she muttered, and glanced down at the bottom desk drawer, where she kept a stash of candy. Not every telephone call was a problem or an emergency, but she was ready for either.When she finally answered the telephone and heard her mother's voice, she opened the drawer. She made a mental note to replenish her stock, and took out three dark-chocolate kisses. \"Yes, Mother, I have time to talk now,\" she said, unwrapping a kiss.\"I left three messages for you earlier, and one just now. You never called me back,\" Rose Hutchinson grumbled to her daughter.\"I'm sorry. I've been teaching classes and I had meetings all morning. I haven't had time to check my messages. Why are you whispering?\" she asked, trying to divert her mother's attention away from her criticisms. She slipped the chocolate kiss into her mouth and let it begin to melt slowly against the inside of her cheek.\"I'm talking as loud as I can manage,\" her mother replied.\"I'm sick, which you would have known if you'd bothered to call me today.\"Ellie straightened her back and swallowed the last of the chocolate kiss. \"But I just talked to you last night. You were fine then. What‚Äî\"\"I know I was fine. Until this morning. I feel awful. My neck hurts and my jaw hurts and my chest hurts. I called Dr. Stafford's office and told the receptionist that I think I have the flu. He can see me this afternoon at four o'clock, but I just don't think I can make it there by myself. I'm feeling too weak. I need you to take me,\" she whined.She went on before Ellie could respond. \"Unless you're too busy. Then I'll have to take a cab. I'm sure the driver won't mind helping me into the cab or waiting for me while I'm at the doctor's office. Phyllis's daughter always takes her to the doctor's for her appointments, but then, her daughter has the sense to not be working anymore. She's retired now, you know, so she can spend a lot of time with her mother, not that you would consider retiring‚Äî\"\"I'll take you. Of course, I'll take you,\" Ellie insisted, interrupting before she was compared unfavorably, again, to her mother's friend's near-perfect daughter.Resigned, Ellie gave up any idea of taking a catnap this afternoon between the end of the school day at three and the start of parent conferences at six-thirty. Despite her contentious relationship with her mother, she did not resent her responsibilities as an only child. Taking her eighty-five-year-old mother to the doctor had become a frequent task in the past year.Assuming Dr. Stafford saw her mother on time, which he usually did, and assuming her mother prolonged her appointment for a good fifteen minutes by arguing with the doctor, which she usually did, Ellie would be able to take her mother home, pick up whatever prescription she might need at the pharmacy, bring it back to her mother's home, and still be on time for parent conferences tonight.Unfortunately, dinner did not fit into this scheme, which meant Ellie would have to rely on the teachers' traditional cookie tray for sustenance tonight‚Äîif someone in the administration had remembered to order it.\"I'll probably need you to stop at the store for ginger ale, too. I'll have to drink lots of clear fluids if I have the flu,\" her mother said.\"I took you for your flu shot, Mother, remember?\" Ellie asked, rather than point out that flu season was nearly over.\"Certainly I remember. I'm old, Ellie, but I'm not senile. And just because I had a flu shot doesn't mean I don't have the flu. Last year, Alice Williams got the flu shot and she came down with the flu, if you'll recall.\"\"I can pick you up at quarter to four,\" Ellie replied choosing not to continue the argument. \"Is that all right or do you need me to come over now?\" she asked, with one eye on the mound of paperwork and the other on those two chocolate kisses sitting on top of her desk.\"Quarter to four is fine, but only if you're on time.\"Ellie pursed her lips, cradled the telephone against her shoulder and slowly unwrapped another kiss. \"I'll be on time.\"\"Well, I certainly can't do anything about it if you're not. With all the responsibilities you've had at school for the past umpteen years, I can't imagine how you've survived without learning to be more punctual. Unless it's just because I'm not important enough‚Äî\"\"I'll be there. Quarter to four,\" Ellie interrupted again. She waited until she heard her mother hang up, then popped the kiss into her mouth.Enduring her mother's criticism was nothing new for Ellie. She honestly could not remember a single moment in all of her sixty years when she had truly pleased her mother. Rose Hutchinson had already lived a long and full life, and Ellie reminded herself that each day her mother was here was a gift. Each day, however, was also one more day for Ellie to be reminded again of how she had disappointed the one person who mattered most: her mother.She bowed her head and knitted her hands together. She prayed for patience, for strength and guidance, so that she might find the path that would lead her to discovering the love and acceptance she still desperately wanted from her mother.At four o'clock, Ellie and her mother were sitting in Dr. Stafford's office. Dressed conservatively in black slacks, a black top and a plaid blazer, Ellie was also still wearing the sensible, lace-up oxfords she wore to school every day. In contrast, her mother had chosen to wear a bright aqua dress, calf-length and ultra-feminine, which did little to complement her full figure, along with pumps, a matching handbag and costume jewelry that included a large turquoise brooch, bracelet and dangling earrings.Half an hour later, after Dr. Stafford had examined Rose Hutchinson and rendered a tentative diagnosis, Ellie fervently wished that her mother indeed had the flu. \"Are you sure?\" she asked the doctor. \"Mother has absolutely no history of heart trouble, and her cholesterol level has been dropping since she started her new medication. When I talked to her earlier today, she wasn't complaining about pain in her chest or arm. Aren't those the signs that would have told us‚Äî\"\"Don't argue with the man,\" her mother interrupted, as if she reserved that right exclusively for herself. \"He's the doctor. If he thinks I had a heart attack and I need to go to the hospital, then it's best if I go‚Äîeven though I'm not convinced he's right, mind you. If you're worried about getting back to school in time for those conferences, you can drop me off at the emergency room. Or I can always go by ambulance, can't I, Dr. Stafford?\"\"I do think getting you to the hospital as soon as possible would be best,\" he said firmly, repeating his earlier recommendation, \"although I don't think it's necessary to call for an ambulance.\"\"I'll drive her to the hospital right away and stay with her,\" Ellie replied, clarifying her intentions.\"Good. I'll call ahead so they're waiting for you,\" the doctor said. \"Now remember, I'm sending you to the hospital as a precaution, Mrs. Hutchinson. I don't want you or your daughter to jump to conclusions or to panic.

Gore (2000) relieve societal unease  about the way democratic and political systems were altered  during the 2000 presidential election? Ackerman (Sterling  Professor of Law and Political Science, Yale Univ.) here  collects a series of extended discussions on this topic by a  distinguished array of current and former law professors  representing many different ideological stances. The essays were  written long enough after the decision to provide a different  perspective from books published immediately afterward, such as  Richard Posner's Breaking the Deadlock: The 2000 Election, the  Constitution, and the Courts and Howard Gillman's The Votes That  Counted: How the Court Decided the 2000 Presidential Election.  The 13 articles almost equally address whether this decision had  a solid basis in the \"rule of law\" or a foundation in legal  principles and whether the U.S. Supreme Court should have used  the doctrine of \"political questions\" and allowed either state  or congressional institutions to resolve such disputes. Some  argue that taking that path would prevent judges from immersing  themselves in political thickets and thereby creating dangerous  threats to the court's legitimacy with the American public and  elected officials. This deft examination of the various legal  and political implications of Bush v. Gore will attract readers  in academic and law libraries. Steven Puro, St. Louis Univ.

This is just the kind of book the National Academy of Engineering has been encouraging to promote the importance of engineering to the public. It will have a long shelf-life in that it pulls together material that is not readily accessible, and will serve as a reference for anyone interested in engineering as a profession. Engineering needs this book! (John Hutchinson, Harvard University)Engineering - An Endless Frontieris extraordinary in scope. Sunny Auyang describes the different kinds of contemporary engineering practices and productions, attempts to provide historical background, explains the scientific basis for engineering innovation in different fields, and addresses the broad, systems level managerial, entrepreneurial, and design activities of professionals. It's rare to find a single author who can grasp and explain the essential features of modern technologies across such an array of industrial sectors and engineering disciplines and explain how they work, why they work the way they do, and what is required for their innovation, development and, yes, even maintenance. (Louis L. Bucciarelli, Professor Emeritus of Engineering and Technology Studies, MIT)Once natural scientists sought to discover what was not known and engineers tried to create what did not exist:Engineering--An Endless Frontiercharts the drawing together of the two disciplines, showing that modem engineering has drawn on par with science in its emerging technologies and achievements. (Bookwatch2004-11-01)As we wrestle today with the now traditional disparities between disciplines, it is refreshing to read an account that places the natural and engineering sciences as mutually interdependent intellectual peers, which is just as it should be. (Peter WilliamsPhysics World2005-03-01)[Auyang's] book is a concise yet comprehensive overview of how modern engineers in various fields have conducted scientific research, designed products, and managed enterprises. Indeed, we can learn a lot from her careful and detailed investigations of engineering practice, which, from my point of view, has been considerably understudied. Nevertheless, the more important value of Auyang's book lies not in the information it provides, but in the questions it raises.

At the age of eighteen, he was invested into the Knights of Peter Claver, after having attended St. Joseph's College Seminary where he studied for the Catholic priesthood. Stovall graduated from Bishop O'Dowd High School and attended St. Mary's College, but left college to join the U.S. Air Force. In 1966, Stovall graduated magna cum laude from the University of California in 1969, after spending a year studying at the University of Lund in Sweden researching the Swedish Ombudsman. Stovall used this research to write his master's thesis at the University of California at Davis. Becoming a National Foundation Fellow in 1973, Stovall received his Ph.D in Political Theory from the Political Science Department at the University of California, Berkeley.  Dr. Stovall worked for the California State Legislature as well as the University of California's Institute of Race &amp; Community Relations before going into the corporate world where he worked for Pacific Bell for 18 years. At the same time Dr. Stovall has been an adjunct faculty member at USF, St. Mary's College, San Francisco State University and Merritt College. In his ten years at St. Mary's College, he taught such courses as Greek Thought, Roman, Christian &amp; Medieval Thought &amp; Renaissance, 17th &amp; 18th Century Thought using the 'shared inquiry' methodology with 'critical thinking' outcomes.  Eugene Stovall's previous novels include the 2007 IPPY Bronze Medal winner, Frank Yerby: A Victim's Guilt. For this first effort In May, 2006, Dr. Stovall hosted a Frank Yerby Symposium at the Oakland Museum. The Hayward South County NAACP honored Stovall for memorializing the great black novelist, Frank Yerby. Stovall's second novel is entitled, Blood &amp; Brotherhood: A Novel of Love in a Time of Hate.

He was one of seven boys, three of which entered upon gospel ministry (John James, Horatius, and Andrew) in their early years. He was ordained a minister in the Church of Scotland on November 30th, 1837, and was later given charge over the North Parish Church in Kelso. Bonar was counted among the dissenting ministers who left the Established Church to form the Free Church of Scotland in what was known as the Disruption of 1843. In 1866 he accepted a call to pastor in Edinburgh at the newly erected Chalmers Memorial Church. He was one in a long line of ministers in the Bonar family. In the May 1908 edition of The Scotsman magazine, they estimated that the Bonar descendants (John Bonar 1671-1747) served a total of 364 years in the pulpits of Scottish churches. From the pulpit, Bonar‚Äôs message was simple and clear: he preached a crucified and risen Christ, whose righteousness alone was the only hope of sinners. He was adept in the exposition of a free gospel through the necessary sovereign workings of the Holy Spirit. His presentation always placed an emphasis on the urgent and immediate necessity of leaving one‚Äôs sin and coming to Christ; and this as the only means of reconciliation between man and God. In a rare autobiographical piece, Dr. Bonar wrote of his theology: ‚ÄúRighteousness without works to the sinner, simply on his acceptance of the Divine message concerning Jesus and His sufficiency,‚Äìthis has been the burden of our good news‚Ä¶It is one message, one gospel, one cross, one sacrifice, from which nothing can be taken and to which nothing can be added. This is the‚Ä¶beginning and the ending of our ministry.‚Äù", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Coupled with his rabid interest in Political Talk and Television programs since that time, he has amassed a wealth of knowledge and opinions which he is in a prime position to present in his style of  literary explanation.  While growing up Teeluck had the rare opportunity to be in a family that had a strong presence of many religious influences, including Catholicism, Hinduism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, Muslimism and coupled with his own studies in Buddhism since his teenage years. Teeluck was able to interact with and observe these many influences inside and outside of the home setting and also in the various houses of worships and this laid a strong foundation for his ability to compare and garner what the core of each religious persuasion taught and also what they aspired to extol and inspire in their societal roles.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Simply put, the vocoder (invented in the late 1920s) took human speech and broke it up into its constituent frequencies, thus allowing that voice to be transmitted electronically, and reassembled and synthesized at the other end, reproducing the words, if not the sound, of the original speech. The vocoder was developed as a means of encrypting speech, of protecting transmissions from prying ears. But, over time, it found other uses, in movies, television, and music (if you want to imagine what it sounds like, recall the Cylons from the original Battlestar Galactica). Eventually, what began its life as a tool for cryptology became a pop-culture icon. Tompkins tells the vocoder‚Äôs story with great relish, as though he can‚Äôt believe how mind-blowingly cool the device is, and it‚Äôs impossible to read the book without being caught up in his enthusiasm. This one has cult audience written all over it. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even so, this book tells the tales of real people, many of them the author's kin--their philosophic bent and extraordinary vocabulary, neither of which has its roots in erudition, and how they combine individuality, irreverence, and human warmth into a reasonable way of life that hardly seems possible in this day and age.  Charles Morrow Wilson, with his taletelling talent, provides us with a bushelful of humorously woven and homespun stories. We are taken down a road, part past, part present, where a fancy car would lose its axle within the hour, but where the age of anxiety hasn't made much headway either, to find a slice of American life not duplicable anywhere.", "related": [], "rank": 2360879, "title": "Bodacious Ozarks, The", "author": "Charles Wilson", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What if it happens to me? Will I be strong enough? In this unblinking account of her confrontation with a \"freakishly rare\" and persistent form of brain cancer, Laura Claridge explores the deep well of courage and strength she found during a vicious decade-long cycle of treatment, recovery, relapse, and repeat. Claridge experienced her first symptoms while writing a biography of etiquette and manners doyenne Emily Post. The cancer began to warp her once-sharp mind--\"I wasn't crazy, I was sick,\" she learned--and the treatments often wreaked havoc on her body. At one point early in her ordeal, she said her goodbyes to her husband and children. More than once she would find herself on the brink of death, but she repeatedly battles back, like some hard-headed boxer who refuses to go down. During her setback-ridden recovery, she clings to her Emily Post project as a lifeline--\"If only I kept writing, I would never die.\" She also finds that the lessons of Post (who lost her son to appendicitis, and forced herself to heal) \"served her in good stead,\" and she develops \"a new admiration for my subject.\" It's hugely satisfying, then, to learn of the book's eventual success. This is a chilling, heartbreaking story, and surprisingly funny. Lessons on the science of cancer read like aCSIepisode. Ultimately, Claridge decides that life is like a good book: \"full of twists and turns.\" --Neal Thompson", "related": ["B004IEA8TM"], "rank": 1301814, "title": "Mind Over Manners (Kindle Single)", "author": "Laura  Claridge", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet, with the help of a loving father, Peter learned some of the fundamental lessons that would later bloom into his life‚Äôs work. Those hardships would later prove to be an important part of the foundation towards his future successes. Throughout his schooling, Peter had a keen sense of giving teachers exactly what they wanted and spending very little time doing it. Peter went on to graduate at the top of his class from both his undergraduate and graduate programs and earning himself a Masters in Business Administration degree from Ashford University. Professionally, motivated by the financial challenges his family endured growing up, Peter has always focused his efforts on becoming as valuable of a contributor as humanly possible. That focus and his innate passion propelled him from frontline production worker into senior management within five years, working for large corporations, small companies and small companies wanting to become large corporations over the years. Peter vowed to do whatever he could to truly help individuals thrive and prosper, people who don‚Äôt quite know how to actually get what they want in life. He makes it his life‚Äôs focus to understand human motivation, to not just learn what it takes to succeed, but to also truly comprehend how the ‚Äúsystem of humanity‚Äù functions.  Through direct observation and intense study of hundreds of scholars, visionaries, tyrants and ‚ÄúAverage Joes‚Äù, Peter has built a philosophy that recognizes basic human needs and one that builds a way forward for any individual in search of a prosperous life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has allowed him to inspire the young children who he mentors by being a living testimony that they don't have to be a product of their environment, but can be the product that changes their environment. He is the author of 'Lying Fully Clothed: Exposing The Naked Truth About Men' which is a book written in order to help shed light on the psyche of men. He decided to study Anthropology in order to gain an insight into the human body and its workings. This, coupled with his experience with women, has equipped him with the skills to articulately deliver a message on areas women have issues with when it comes to men. Dear Rob has been that guy that has broken hearts, so he gives first hand stories and accounts on how to avoid men like the former him and signs to know if you're Ms Justine Case. He uses a direct and unadulterated approach to hit home and unveil the shroud covering women who continue to fall for the same type of man. His unique approach, and the manner in which he arouses emotion in his audience, are auspicious.

The plot of the story is interesting with a surprising twist, and you can't help but dislike Amanda's husband Vince from the start and side with her getting together with Jackson although she is a married woman.

The result is a wide range of emotions and opinions that reflects the complexity on the ground throughout Arizona. ... Rose writes well, and the mix of personal stories and commentary makes for an attractive read. ... An irenic, evenhanded work that gets the conversation going in the right direction.\" --Christianity Today\"Attempts to tackle one of the most urgent yet intractable national problems...

Until the U.S. resolves its immigration mess, the opportunities and conundrums for people of faith who want to try to save lives in the desert seem likely only to expand.\" --America\"There is no better time to read this groundbreaking book than right now.Showdown in the Sonoran Desertoffers a powerful, nuanced ethnographic analysis of a seemingly irresolvable problem in contemporary U.S. society: immigration, and all of the urgent moral and political dilemmas it embodies. This study is unflinching in its exploration of the central question of social, and governmental, responsibility for the suffering and death that continues to mark the terrain of the US/Mexico borderland in southern Arizona.  Author Ananda Rose shows us that a meaningful response to this human rights crisis is possible, but it requires genuine dialogue and the hard work of listening carefully to a multiplicity of voices--especially those that are least likely to be heard above the din of combative rhetoric.\"-- Amy E. Den Ouden, author ofBeyond Conquest: Native Peoples and the Strugglefor History in New England\"A profound, poetic and passionate work of scholarship, this is one of the best books I have read on religion and migration. Thoroughly research, yet engaging and illuminating, Ananda Rose gives a rich, ethnographic account and fresh, theological insight into a complex and controversial drama at the border. It challenges not only the way we understand the journey of migration but also our journey with God and each other.\"-- Daniel Groody, Associate Professor of Theology, University of Notre Dame\"On what basis do people assume the right to seek their fortunes in a place where, strictly speaking, they have no place?  And what do we owe these strangers?  In accessible prose and illuminating detail, Ananda Rose explores the contending politico-legal and ethical issues that arise whenever the poor and oppressed cross international frontiers in search of a better life.\"-- Michael Jackson, author ofThe Palm at the End of the Mind\"The author leaves the reader with this challenge: \"And there is you, reading this, asking yourself, what should we do?\" The author believes that solutions that end migrant deaths and suffering on the border also will lead to a healthier global economy.

He had emigrated to the United States in his early twenties, reaching New Orleans in January, 1840, where he pursued a varied career as a shopkeeper, overseer of slaves, schoolmaster, and actor, with occasional forays into hunting and Indian warfare. Reid returned to England in 1849, and embarked upon a successful career as a writer of adventure novels and books for boys He was a close friend of Poe (though their writings were miles apart), played a gallant role in the Mexican War, worked as a journalist and wrote most of his first novel while in the United States.He was an influence on the young mind of Teddy Roosevelt, as Roosevelt reveals in his Autobiography; while Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in his 1890s essay \"Juvenilia\" that when young he always kept \"Mr. Ballantyne or Captain Mayne Reid at my elbow\"; Robert Louis Stevenson praised Reid in the Vailima Letters, and J.

While preparing their\ndefense in the face of a trial that could lead to their hanging, they discover\nthe town's dark, hidden underbelly. Although picturesque, Mount Hope, Pa.,\nis ruthlessly controlled by a few puppet masters who make their own rules,\naided by lax laws and geographical isolation. Founding families have a heavy\nhand in the region, providing a cast of characters who are rich, spoiled, greedy\nand possibly murderous. But helpmeets abound, too. The tale is rounded out by a\nboyish young doctor, John--a romantic prospect for Jenny--and a kindly innkeeper\nand his wife, who attempt to aid the father and daughter in proving their\ninnocence. After Marc suffers a heart attack, Jenny matures as she takes on the\nbulk of the murder investigation....Altman\nconvincingly sets Jenny and Marc's evolving father-daughter relationship and\nJenny and the doctor's blossoming romance against the seedy corruption of the\ncoal-rich town, all the while teasing out the mystery and hiding the real culprit\nuntil the very end--no small feat for a debut author.¬†A perfectly framed mystery with the twists\nand turns of a mine shaft.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has a Ph.D. in English and has taught Western culture, literature, and writing at several universities, most recently the University of Southern Indiana and the University of Evansville, both in Evansville, Indiana, and the Union Institute & University in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Her interest in metaphysical subjects goes back to childhood when she had her first out-of-body experience while learning to tie her shoes. In the 1990s she produced and hosted a talk show on self-development and futurist topics called Kaleidoscope for Tomorrow on community cable television in Fairfax, Virginia, an experience that qualified her as an ‚Äúagent provocateur.‚Äù She also does past life and Tarot card readings and occasionally talks to ghosts.  Susan Smily, during her 25 years in the classroom, was an author, publisher, and workshop leader in elementary science education in Canada, Australia, and the United States. She created her own business for the development and production of a wide range of elementary education materials, worked as a writer, editor, and consultant with several educational programs, and made presentations at over 40 school and district professional development days. She was also once the Science Teacher of the Year (cover girl) for Boreal Science Supply Catalogue and as a result had coffee stains on her face in every high school in Canada. She is the author of ‚ÄúPianissimo,‚Äù a one-act play that was presented off Broadway on April 13-15, 1998, at the Festival of Collective Voices, at the Harold Clurman Theatre in New York.  She has traveled extensively in North America, Europe, Australia, and the Far East. She developed an interest in metaphysical studies in the early 1990s and has since become involved in studying many areas of spirituality, including Native American, Vedanta, and Kabbalah.

Ferris, author ofGive My Poor Heart Ease: Voices of the Mississippi Blues\"Robert Blade's fast paced, richly detailed biography of newspaper publisher George McLean reads like a good novel, sketching a deeply human portrait of a volatile visionary who believed that helping poor rural folk help themselves was his spiritual mission in life, and who put time, effort, and millions of dollars of his own money to the task. From his mischievous boyhood days of hitching rides on freight trains to his rise as a fractious northeast Mississippi community organizer for literacy and economic development for African Americans and whites alike, McLean springs to life as a passionate man of vision who vowed to change his own little postage stamp of soil for the better, earning himself a lasting place in Mississippi, southern, and American history.

One day, Jenny messes up the recipe and her husband is outraged by its terrible taste. As she watches her husband, the dry crumbs falling out of his mouth, she suddenly snaps and shoots him square in the head.Cornbreadis told entirely in Jenny's no-nonsense voice, from her post-murder, prison-cell vantage point.

You will violentlycollide with life and death in all its beauty .The vast spectrum of loveand hate, happiness and sadness is vividly etched in assorted rhymeschemes which faintly echo bards of the past whom I have loved, readand reread many times over.Should you enjoy similar styles of prose and poetry as I, you willrecognize in many verses familiar ghost-like renderings, reflecting theworks of Emily Jane Bront√´, Lord Byron, Christina Rossetti andLaurence Hope. You willfind some of my lyrics conversant withRudyard Kipling, and OmarKhayyam,as translated by Edward FitzGerald.These andother poets with the same flair, that similar yet distinctive and stylishelegance made up the inspiration which lent the voice within my mind,demanding to be heard. For these were the poets I have so loved and readover the years, which in turn bred the desire and yearning that led me tocreate similar veins of verse.This is the perfect book to accompany anyone who, for a time, beit an hour, a day or a week, seeks the solitude of a safe harbor away fromthe crowds, the noise, and the humdrum trappings of everyday life. Aquiet place to turn thoughts inward upon their beating heart and livingsoul. Such is the way one can be as near to their God and to themselves, aspossible.ArchieJ.

Carroll was the youngest of seven children and was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1970 where he was kept in a dresser drawer with the clean socks. Luckily, he wasn‚Äôt kept with the dirty socks or else he might have grown up to become slightly warped. As a child, John spent most of his time wandering through the Mojave Desert in an attempt to avoid people. He would stare at the sky, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. One of his favorite memories is watching his dad build the fuselage of Evel Kneivel‚Äôs skycycle in their garage. One of his least favorite moments was watching that skycycle fall into the Snake River. (Not his dad‚Äôs fault and he has documentation to prove it, so nyah) As a teenager, John spent most of his time driving wherever he could in an attempt to avoid people. He would stare at the road, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. He was the captain of the chess team, lettered in golf and band while in high school, and wasn‚Äôt beaten up anywhere near as much as one might imagine. As an adult, John spends most of his time staring at a computer screen in an attempt to avoid people. He stares at the monitor for hours, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. He has been married to his wonderful wife for fifteen years and they have three obnoxio . . . wonderful children who always behave . . . when they‚Äôre asleep. Emo bunny minions surround John at most times. He is their imaginary friend and they look to him for guidance. At one point, they took over the world. No one noticed because they left everything exactly as it was. They gave the world back after a week because it was depressing. The Willden Trilogy is his first endeavor into the field of writing. Other series and standalone works will be forthcoming. In addition, John has written a number of short stories he publishes for free because he likes you so much. (And it‚Äôs good marketing. Shh) He writes in the evenings and weekends whenever possible. Regrettably, the family mentioned in the previous paragraph desires food and shelter, requiring the author to possess a full time job until his writing makes him rich.", "related": ["B00LEVJ79Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He lives with his wife in the State Washington. The premise of the series begins when Thomson acquired a small bronze statue found in a cave in the jungles of Liberia, West Africa. The old statue depicted a warrior holding a Stone Age ax and a spear. Its origin was unknown; however, that statue was more than just a man, it was a demon and a man. It was an ENDOSYM, two beings living in one body. Following the 1970 Liberian Coup Thomson was shown a site where high-ranking Liberian officials were conducting human sacrifices and worshiping a demon. From those two events and stories told around the campfires by indigenous Liberians about mysterious beings and lost cities, the die was cast for the ENDOSYM series.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She entered the US Army in 1984 where she met and married her husband of 27-year  Minister Kim Harris. They have two children Dominique and Stephanie. She exited the military in 1991 just shortly after delivering their daughter Stephanie. Her husband retired from the military in 2001, and they now reside in Waynesville, Missouri. She spent years writing and directing Christmas and Easter plays for her local church before becoming the playwright for her long-time friend Evangelist Susan Marshal of \"Still Useable Ministries\". Most of her inspirations came from a single song titled \"Reasons\" by Lynetta \"Cocoa\" Powell. She currently attends MOEC (Metamorphosis Outreach Empowerment Church) located in St. Robert, MO. Cynthia is the god mother of eight children: LaToshia Franklin-Webb (Whom she had the privilege of officiating her marriage to Derrick Webb), Kushaiah, Sharon  and Daniel Seymour, Geneva Alexander-Dawson, Samuel Horton, and Malcolm and Miesha Hall. She is known to many others as Momma Harris. You can view photos of her children/god-children and family and friends on the photo's page. She is a cosmetologists and currently owns and operates, Heavenly Creations Hair and Nail Studio located in St. Robert just outside Fort Leonard Wood, MO.    Many of the instances in her works are inspired by challenges, situations and tragedies that have occurred in her own life of how God brought her through when the pieces of her life began to fall apart and unravel. She is passionate about writing and understands that her mandate from God is to reach many with her gift of imagination and knowledge of the Word of God to minister to the hurt, confused and lost through romance and sound & drama.  All of her works are intertwined with each other and have one thing in common...the great state of Georgia.  Georgia is a base location for almost every book and the characters or either from there or the story is taking place there. Each book exposes the nature and title of the next one. Cynthia understands  that her responsibility to God is to spread his word by any means necessary. It is her determination to do just that...through the power of fiction romance and sound & drama.

Although the availability of computers and free programs might draw in library users initially, it is the customer service they encounter that will bring them back. This work offers food for thought on diverse topics, such as recognizing the benefit of reorganizing collections, using technology to improve customer service, reaching out to homeschooling families, and creating and establishing new customer-service initiatives. Nine case studies are presented, and most of them end with notes or a list of resources, allowing users to delve further into the topic. Through these proven best practices, this book will help librarians revitalize customer-service policies at their own libraries and inspire them to do more. --Stephanie Charlefour", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this book he develops and amplifies Bowlby's original ideas by linking them to current work in child development and psychotherapy. In a crucial distinction, he shows that attachment and intimacy refer to different forms of relating which are developmentally connected, the form of attachment shaping the later style of intimate behavior. This maturation is related to the capacity for narrative. (Russell Meares)Holmes not only gives clinicians a fundamental understanding of attachment theory but demonstrates its applicability to everyday practice concerns. By describing the characteristics of avoidant and ambivalent attachment, he helps therapists understand more fully the difficulties that patients have in achieving, maintaining, and thriving within a secure base. (Karen B. Walant)Attachment theory has finally come into its own in the clinical setting. The conceptual framework provided by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and their successors has wide psychotherapeutic applications that are brilliantly described in this impressive work by Jeremy Holmes. Much that is chaotic in the clinical setting becomes clear and understandable when the principles of attachment theory are brought to bear. To the reader's great good fortune, Holmes's prose style is a model of clarity so that abstruse concepts are effortlessly grasped by the reader and the author's humanity shines through. (Glen O.

Just think of how cars have changed, and you will see what I mean.They would neither comprehend nor believe what you were trying to tell them. Therefore you would have to bring them back with you, into the future, so that they could see it for themselves.Then I thought, what if the accidental time-traveller was based on me in 2010, and the 14 year old boy in 1955 was also based on me¬†at that time, then I could build in some autobiographical elements.

Had one-time north Idaho journalist Ned¬†Hayes made this tantalizing question the centerpiece of his debut novel, he might¬†have only created a derivative retelling of an all-too-familiar serial killer¬†plot. Instead, he takes the plot for this well-written literary thriller from¬†the historical facts of the still-unsolved Sunshine Mine disaster in 1972, and¬†winds it tight around the troubled central figure of Matt Worthson, a one time¬†candidate for Sheriff in Coeur d'Alene.¬†Worthson, suffering from a broken marriage and a suspect car¬†accident, is pulled into a tangled history of corrupt politics, separatist plots,¬†and powerful interests who control the lucrative Idaho mining industry.¬† The novel opens with the discovery of the¬†mutilated body of a chaplain who works with the police department, and seems to¬†point towards a local serial killer who is again on the loose. But this tried¬†and true plot soon moves in a more complicated direction, as Worthson's own¬†motivations and past crimes are brought under the microscope.The story of the Sunshine Mine disaster itself is told in a¬†flashback that is both compelling and heart-rending, as Worthson struggles with¬†his father's impending death, and the secrets his father still refuses to¬†reveal about the mine disaster - the truth of which has important implications¬†for Worthson's investigation.Coeur d'Alene Waters is a solidly written murder mystery¬†with a haunting finish, reminiscent of the best of Ridley Pearson or the early¬†work of fellow Washington writer Jess Walter.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His sister Amy, wanting to get away from the shelter of their over-protective parents, goes against their wishes and joins him.

When her \"experiments\" start taking effect and Amy starts blossoming, Andrew disapproves more and more.   The only problem for Denise are her feelings for Andrew--can she be her spontaneous self and help those she cares about without alienating him and his conservative ways?", "related": ["B00DTTW7IC"], "rank": 1893638, "title": "A New Attitude", "author": "Debby Mayne", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Coleman. Currently I am 32 years old originally from Charlotte, NC. I'm the Author of the novel, \"Bless Da Child Dat Holds His Own\" and \"No the Hell She Didn't.\" In order to view my novels cover page and synopsis, Google my name and book title. I simply love to write. I feel as though I was blessed with the talent to use my imagination, create characters and share with the world my stories. I'm very versatile and professionally good at what I do. Along with writing novels, I definitely read a lot, personal fitness trainer, write screen plays, stage plays and I've just completed a Children's Entrepreneur book. I'm all for accomplishing goals and striving for success. Slowly but surely, my hard work is now finally starting to pay off. I can't stop and I definitely won't stop pushing myself to succeed. I have a mind that never stops working. The brain I have is loaded with many ideas and plans. I keep myself occupied and I'm never bored because I'm always working on something which will help me in the future. Nothing comes to those who wait for handouts. I believe no human who has mobility, in good shape and good health should wait for anything. Get up off your behind and get it! Stop depending on the finances of others and make things happen for yourself. If they succeeded, so can you. I sincerely believe in getting things done. If you have any questions or any comments about any of my novels, feel free to speak your mind or you can contact me via email at wbcoleman81@gmail.com or PenPushingPublishingLLC@gmail.com Thanks.

They make excellent heroines.‚Äù --Literary Review¬†Praise forMurder in the Afternoon¬†‚ÄúFrances Brody succeeds brilliantly. . . Her post-war world in which making any sort of living is hard grind and where an independent career woman is viewed with hostility is entirely convincing. Kate is a heroine to like and admire. . . Her further adventures are eagerly awaited.‚Äù --The Daily Mail¬†Praise forA Medal for Murder¬†‚ÄúBrody again displays her prodigious talent for misdirection, tempered by her fair play with clues that render the possibility that the reader will not be fooled. But don‚Äôt bet on it‚Ä¶. Steeped in period color,A Medal for Murderagain showcases a winning heroine and a clever plot, a combination reminiscent of the genre‚Äôs golden age but one made fresh and gripping by an author who melds murder with mercy.‚Äù ‚ÄìRichmond Times-Dispatch¬†‚ÄúBrody‚Äôs excellent second offers a morally conflicted sleuth, historically detailed flashbacks to the Boer War and a clever mystery indeed.‚Äù --Kirkus¬†‚ÄúThis lusciously written historical cozy is an excellent addition to the crowded 1920s market, and Brody‚Äôs second series entry (afterDying in the Wool) positions her for deserved attention. Her gentle and traditional structure (noteworthy use of flashbacks) pairs nicely with Kerry Greenwood (see review above) and Jacqueline Winspear titles.‚Äù ‚ÄìLibrary Journal¬†‚ÄúThe traditional British mystery is alive and well, thanks in part to Frances Brody and her lady detective, Kate Shackleton‚Ä¶ Kate is very adept at sizing people up and maximizing the information that she can get from them‚Ä¶I especially liked the number of curves the author threw in toward the end of the novel.‚Äù ‚ÄìMystery Scene¬†‚ÄúDetective Kate Shackleton solves her second murder mystery in this fun, well-plotted mystery set in 1920s Harrogate‚Ä¶ Brody presents us with a mystery full of lively characters and significant stories of both past and present. As Faulkner said, the past isn‚Äôt dead. It isn‚Äôt even past. Brody‚Äôs mystery is expertly crafted and keeps the reader guessing right up until the last pages, as a good mystery should.‚Äù ‚ÄìHistoricalNovelSociety.org¬†‚ÄúMore twists and turns than a country road. I hope that Ms. Brody writes more of these novels because I thoroughly enjoyed this one‚Ä¶ I just had to keep reading so that I could try to figure out who the murderer was. I never knew until the last page and then I still wondered if they caught the real murderer.‚Äù ‚ÄìNightOwlReviews.com¬†‚ÄúThese gentle crime novels, that have you guessing at every turn‚Ä¶ are a pure joy.¬† Refreshing and highly entertaining, especially for the winter nights.‚Äù ‚ÄìYorkshireGazette and Herald¬†\"A Medal for Murdercontains all the elements of crime fiction - theft, kidnap, murder, a feisty private detective, a handsome Detective Inspector, a (sometimes) dour sidekick, plenty of suspects and all the twists and turns we expect from our genre‚Ä¶. A work of extraordinary depth, lightness of touch and strength of characterisation.\" --Mystery Women¬†‚Äú[Kate Shackleton‚Äôs] lively wit and intuitive abilities serve her well as she steps into the limelight¬†of this drama filled with theft, deception, assumed identities, faked kidnapping, blackmail, and murder-- a veritable theatrical trunk full of mystery-plot props.¬† The¬†author's period details-- including some flashbacks to the Boer War, involving incidents vital to the present-day plot-- add further historical flavor and thoroughly enhance¬†Brody's show.‚Äù --bookreviewsbydavidmarshalljames.blogspot.com¬†‚ÄúThe setting of A Medal for Murder is England in the 1920s, an idyllic time for crime solving. The right mix of mobility (motor cars) and technology (telephone and telegraph) keeps the story moving along at a pleasant place‚Ä¶ The story line is enhanced by quips, fashion and social commentary and generally charming banter among the characters. Mystery fans not familiar with Ms. Brody‚Äôs mystery series are encouraged to catch up post haste! Highly recommended.‚Äù --http://josephsreviews.wordpress.com¬†Praise forDying in the Wool¬†\"The first in a planned series introduces a refreshingly complex heroine and adds a fine feeling for the postwar period.\" ‚ÄìKirkus¬†\"Brody, who has written historical fiction, presents a carefully researched setting, with accurate references to the popular culture of the day and clear explanations of the dyeing and weaving processes at the mill.\" --Booklist¬†\"Excellent.... Ms. Brody does an excellent job of keeping the reader on the edge of their seat. DYING IN THE WOOL has a lot of unanticipated twists and turns. I was completely surprised at the end! There were so many ways the story could have gone. Cheers to the author for keeping us in suspense until the very last pages.¬† I can't wait to read more Kate Shackleton! This is a series I am definitely hooked on.\" --¬†historyundressed.blogspot.com¬†\"Dying in the Woolhas a winning heroine, a fresh and fascinating setting, richly detailed and well-woven into the plot, and a mystery that twists and tightens and twists again, before pulling together to a surprising and satisfying solution.\" --Catriona McPherson, author ofDandy Gilver and the Proper Treatment of Bloodstains¬†‚ÄúReminiscent of Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie with a thoroughly likeable protagonist and a plot that held me to the end.‚Äù --Mignon F. Ballard, author of the Miss Dimple Kilpatrick Mystery Series¬†‚ÄúThis well-plotted and atmospheric tale is enriched by technical expertise and a vividly imagined Yorkshire setting. ¬†Kate Shackleton joins Jacqueline Winspear‚Äôs Maisie Dobbs in a sub-group of young female amateur detectives who survived and were matured by their wartime experiences‚Ä¶. They make excellent heroines.‚Äù --Literary Review¬†‚ÄúBrody‚Äôs winning tale of textile industry shenanigans is shot through with local color.‚Äù ‚ÄìThe Independent(UK)¬†¬†‚ÄúHighly entertaining‚Ä¶ Frances Brody writes with charm and yet knows how to keep the reader guessing at every stage of the book. If you like pure detective novels you will love this.‚Äù --Gazette & Herald(UK)¬†‚ÄúThe story, with its secure setting in the richly-detailed woollen industry, is an excellent read.¬† The characterization is strong and convincing and the sense of period well conveyed.‚Äù--Mystery Women¬†‚ÄúThe background detail of milling and dyeing is spot on ‚Ä¶ as is her ear for the West Riding accent and dialect. The plot twists nicely and the denouement was, to me, unexpected.‚Äù --Country Life¬†‚ÄúThis is whimsical, colorful stuff and readers will warm to the entrepreneurial yet fragile Kate.‚Äù ‚ÄìTake a Break¬†‚ÄúKate Shackleton is a delightful leading character.¬† The flavor of First World War England is beautifully portrayed.¬† The world of the mill and the mill owner has gone, but in this book it is easy to image what it must have been like‚Ä¶. [Kate‚Äôs] aristocratic connections give the story a whiff of Wimsey and a touch of Christie, but mostly this is just an enjoyable and gripping mystery story with a nasty sting in the tail.‚Äù --CrimeSquad.com¬†‚ÄúDying in the Woolis a delightful book‚Ä¶ the descriptive detail of the countryside and small village of Bridgestead is so vivid I could literally have been there.¬† Kate Shackleton is a wonderful character and I connected with her immediately. She's a very determined soul in a time when women were still treated as second class citizens‚Ä¶. A very gentle book, but with a lot of substance.‚Äù ‚Äì BookChickCity.com¬†¬†‚ÄúThe 1920s are a fascinating and under-used period for new crime fiction, so it‚Äôs a particular pleasure to have Frances setting her story at that time. Kate Shackleton is a splendid heroine ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm looking forward to the next book in the series!‚Äù--Ann Granger", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Without question, Jonas delivers action, adventure, and deep, understanding characterization in every page. His grasp of the human condition, of the deep emotions people hold inside them, even the less-than-desirable characters, and of how people react in times of peace and of trouble, and how he puts this grasp in poetic words upon his pages, sets him apart from many other authors of his day, and especially of his age. Without a doubt, Jonas has another winner on his hands with KNIGHT OF THE RIBBONS, and he will make his reader feel every emotion of the spectrum by the time the last page is turned. --Idaho State JournalExcerpted from a phone message left on March 27, 2014: Kirby, this is Jim Drury calling. I picked up the book and started reading and I read and read and read and read and finished it in about two days. I think it's one of the best books you've ever written. It's really well done. The characters are monumentally attractive, and they just jump off the page at you. The leading man is a great hero. It harkens back to books like Death of an Eagle. Knight of the Ribbons is a winner. It's a wonderful book and it should take off for you. It should be a national best seller. It's really fine. I just loved it. It's a wonderful story, and it will stand the test of time. It certainly should be a motion picture. I don't know how to do that, or I would do it for you. It's something that should happen. It's about as cinematic as you can get. --Actor James Drury, The Virginian", "related": [], "rank": 308024, "title": "KNIGHT OF THE RIBBONS", "author": "KIRBY JONAS", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It might have taken me awhile to finally live my dream, but I did it, my first effort to try and join the many talented writers out there who have kept me entertained with their wonderful stories over the years. I live in a sleepy country town in Tasmania, Australia with my partner and three children plus our 6 cats, dog, sheep and cattle. I've had to overcome many emotional obstacles along the way to get to this point and attempting to self publish a book does tend to make a person feel like they've thrown themselves in at the deep end of the pool some what, but here's hoping some of you actually like what I write and save me from drowning in the deep end of the pool as I probably forgot to mention, I can't swim.

I help explain complicated things to people in a fun and easy-to-understand way.

There's no need to feel ignorant or shy when you're embarking on something new. We'll help you feel comfortable and acclimated in no time at all. If you want to learn about the world of guns, shooting and the American way, check out some of my books. Have a laugh or two. Life is too short for boring books. I also produce a website, MyGunCulture.com that is a half-cocked but right on target look at the world of shooting and all things related.

He is now largely remembered for Strawberry Hill, the home he built in Twickenham, south-west London where he revived the Gothic style some decades before his Victorian successors, and for his Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Along with the book, his literary reputation rests on his Letters, which are of significant social and political interest. He was the son of Sir Robert Walpole, and cousin of the 1st Viscount Nelson. His lasting architectural creation is Strawberry Hill, the home he built in Twickenham, south-west London, in which he revived the Gothic style many decades before his Victorian successors. This fanciful neo-Gothic concoction began a new architectural trend. Strawberry Hill had its own printing press which supported Horace Walpole's intensive literary activity. In 1764, not using his own press, he anonymously published his Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, claiming on its title page that it was a translation \"from the Original Italian of Onuphirio Muralto\". The second edition's preface, according to James Watt, \"has often been regarded as a manifesto for the modern Gothic romance, stating that his work, now subtitled 'A Gothic Story', sought to restore the qualities of imagination and invention to contemporary fiction\". However, there is a playfulness in the prefaces to both editions and in the narration within the text itself. The novel opens with the son of Manfred (the Prince of Otranto) being crushed under a massive helmet that appears as a result of supernatural causes. However, that moment, along with the rest of the unfolding plot, includes a mixture of both ridiculous and sublime supernatural elements. The plot finally reveals how Manfred's family is tainted in a way that served as a model for successive Gothic plots.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maybe that's why the ancient legends of the British Isles hold such fascination for her. Her handsome heroes are flawed, her gutsy heroines challenged, and her wicked villains...well, they are indeed quite wicked, with perhaps one or two redeeming qualities! In her novels, Avril serves up a generous amount of conflict and resolution, throws in a healthy scoop of romance and a generous sprinkling of magic. Her first novel, 'Triskelion',  based on the legend of the last wolf in England, is currently being revised and should be available this summer (2014). The plot of her completed novel, 'The Cast Of A Stone', came to her while watching a rugby match between Wales and England. Unfortunately, she can't remember who won the match. She was too busy making notes. Two more books are near completion. Watch this space! She also has four wee anthologies published on Amazon - a variety of little tales that she writes between chapters. Reviews, comments and questions about her books are welcomed. avrilborthiry.com Facebook page: Quill and Ink by Avril Borthiry Email: allwrite@rogers.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even after it was finished many parts of it ended up on the cutting room floor, making it a little shorter than I originally planned, but I'm a firm believer that quality always prevails over quantity.I really did have fun creating the character of¬† Barry Dunlawton, self-help expert/renowned author, and decided he would be the ideal person to write the foreword for this book because he's fictional--and because Tony Robbins refused to do it.¬†One of the goals of this book, as well as any book I write, is to provide stories so funny and entertaining that my audience will want to read them again and again. Another objective for me is to connect with the reader, because I feel what makes many of the¬† life situations I write about¬† funny is that people can truly relate to them.I was well into writing this book, but couldn't come up with a title. Then one day a co-worker of mine used the phrase \"living healthy is just a slower way to die\". I thought those words not only summed up my life perfectly, but the theme of the book as well. Once I found the picture of the hamster lifting weights, I knew I had the perfect cover to go with the title.Writing is truly a labor of love, and the best rewards are the reviews and feedback from people who have thanked me for making their day a little brighter. Thanks to all of you, and hopefully you won't have to wait so long for the next book.", "related": ["B00987M3CE"], "rank": 1746315, "title": "Fifty is Only Nine in Dog Years: Comic Relief for a Mid-Life Crisis", "author": "Peter Julier", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jacob planted our cooler in the sand near a volleyball net and we unloaded our towels alongside it. Then the guys peeled off their shirts and suddenly I felt as though I was on a Colorado mountain top instead of at sea level. I don't know where all the oxygen disappeared to, but I couldn't seem to get any.\"What are you doing?\" Keith asked as I scanned the ground around us frantically.\"Looking for a club to beat off the girls when they mob us.\"Jacob and Keith traded sardonic looks.\"You're not in Kansas anymore, Toto,\" Jacob told me. \"Take a look around; it's not like we're the only guys out here.\"I didn't need to look around--the two of them had me hyperventilating all by themselves. Between them they seemed to have acres of golden, sun-drenched skin stretched over lean muscle that rippled with every movement, every breath. I felt an almost irresistible compulsion to run my hands over their bodies, to feel that warm, satiny hardness under my fingertips. Even worse, I wanted to brush my lips against them, to taste them with my tongue while I kissed every last inch of those firm, bronzed bodies.Despite the warmth of the sun I shivered, my tongue darting out to wet lips gone bone dry. This was crazy; I had been single too long and my hormones were all out of whack. If I kept having these bizarre reactions to Jacob and Keith there was no way that staying with them was going to work. I had to get myself under control and fast. What I needed was a little distance, a few moments alone to pull myself together.I tugged my t-shirt over my head and started to kick off my flip-flops when a low wolf-whistle stopped me cold.\"Well, well,\" Keith rumbled in a low voice that vibrated all the way down into my bones. \"Our little Melanie is all grown up. We may need that club after all, eh Jacob?\"Bright green eyes glittered with amusement. \"You could be right about that. She definitely outgrew that scrawny, awkward phase she was in when we left.\"\"Nope. There's nothing scrawny about her now,\" Keith said, his own eyes teasingly running from my hair to my toes.My face went hot and I knew I was beet red. \"Oh. My. God. You two lechers haven't changed a bit, have you?\"Jacob grinned unapologetically. \"Nope. Did you really think we would?\"\"No,\" I sighed. \"I suppose not.\"A volleyball appeared as if by magic in Keith's hands. \"So, who gets Melanie on his team?\"\"We'll flip for it,\" Jacob said. \"Call it in the air.\"A quarter glittered in the sun. \"Tails.\"Jacob grinned again as he smacked it against the back of his hand. \"Oh, too bad. It was heads.\"\"Naturally. Come on, Mel.\"I looked at him blankly. \"But you lost.\"\"Exactly.\"I fixed them with my best impersonation of my mom's glare. \"I am going to beat the two of you to death with my flip-flops.\"\"Okay, but after the game,\" Jacob said. \"Want a handicap, Keith? How many points should I spot you? Twenty bucks says I'll be up ten points in ten minutes anyway.\"\"Fine. But go easy on her,\" Keith grumbled. \"It's her first day.\"I stepped up to the net while Keith tossed Jacob the ball. \"Oh, just serve already.\"\"Okay. Here it comes.\"Jacob smacked the ball in an easy lob that floated low towards the net. Before it made it across I jumped high to meet it and spiked it straight down into the sand on Jacob's side. As I landed I did a little pirouette in the sand and allowed myself a self-satisfied smirk.\"Tah-dah!\"For long seconds both guys stared at me, speechless.\"Two years of varsity volleyball, guys. You might have asked before you started running your mouths--something else which hasn't changed, apparently. I believe it's our serve.\"When I glanced back Keith's grin stretched from ear to ear.\"What do you say, Jacob? Double or nothing?\"\"Just shut up and serve.\"There was no more Mr. Nice Guy after that; the boys got down to business and the gloves came off. I had no idea until then that beach volleyball is a blood sport--or at least it was the way those two played it. When they went full out it took everything I had to keep up with them. Before long I was sweaty and covered in sand and my hair was a wreck. It was the most fun I'd had in ages.Jacob served again and the ball sailed high in an arc over my head. Desperately I jumped for it, throwing myself in a wild backwards leap. At the last second my fists hammered the ball back over the net, but I misjudged my landing and stumbled in the sand, limbs flailing--right into Keith.Arms like velvet-covered steel wrapped around my stomach and pulled me tightly against him before I could fall. Where our skin touched hot tingles exploded through me and surged along every nerve I had. I froze in his arms, his bare chest warm and firm against my back, my pulse hammering in my veins while I tried to remember how to breathe.\"Are you okay?\"His breath tickled against my ear and my body came alive, painfully aware of the incredibly sexy guy I was pressed up against. While one part of my brain yelled frantically at me to stand up, another part noticed how lovely it felt and insisted that it would be even nicer if I just relaxed into Keith's embrace and laid my head back against him. My throat wouldn't work so all I could manage was a jerky nod.\"Upsy-daisy,\" he murmured as he set me back onto my feet.I wobbled a bit, but managed to remain upright despite the thoughts swirling dizzyingly through my head and called for a break to get some cold water out of the cooler. This couldn't go on; I couldn't handle being this turned on by the two of them every day. Eventually I was going to slip up without meaning to and that would ruin everything for the three of us. There were tons of hot guys all over the beach; I needed to find one to satisfy that part of my life so I could enjoy my time with my two best friends without constantly being at the mercy of my inappropriate reactions to them.Of course finding another guy would have meant taking my eyes off of Jacob and Keith for more than five minutes, and somehow I just couldn't manage to do that.", "related": [], "rank": 1235322, "title": "Double or Nothing: A Friends to Lovers Menage Romance", "author": "Kelli Wolfe", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
