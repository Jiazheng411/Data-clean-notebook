The problem is the \"underlying literary interest in social criticism.\" One supposes the copywriter mentioned \"literary\" as a pointer to Pyper's prose, which is lush and suffused with psychological insight, but which too often draws attention to itself at the expense of the story. The \"social criticism\" is relayed through character studies-the kidnapped are extremely complex creations, as is their Canadian translator, a woman rapidly approaching middle age, who narrates; her probings into the differences rendered by wealth, class and age among the kidnapped, and between them and their captors, are perceptive and fresh. The novel takes a serious wrong turn, though, when the kidnapped are harbored by a tribe of Yanomami Indians. While giving the narrator plenty of chance to comment on the degradation of the rain forest and its peoples by industrial interests, this turn feels contrived; it leads to the kidnapped ingesting a native hallucinogen, which exacerbates the murkiness of the narrator's perceptions and results in a storytelling muddle that Pyper straightens out only through further contrivances. Pyper is a talented stylist and a masterful psychological portraitist, but his new novel is a slog.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her parents are overseas on business all the time so she is rarely bothered by them, and hunky Brian adores her. However, Junie wishes she could turn back the clock to when her parents were home more often and before she and Brian became sexually active. Her best friend, Celia Clarke, is worried about not having a boyfriend at all, maybe because she's taller than most of the guys she knows. Add Celia's friend Danielle Battaglia, who's desperately in love with Steve the serial cheater, and that's the recipe for some serious girl-bonding. Junie and Danielle first meet at Celia's place, and the three of them rustle up something to eat while discussing their troubles. They eventually turn this into a weekly girls' dinner club, trying new recipes and sharing and supporting one another, somewhat like a YA version of Rebecca Wells'sDivine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood(HarperCollins, 1996). Each of the teens is clearly drawn and has strengths and weaknesses common to girls their age. Their families add unique ingredients to the story. Disturbingly casual sexual activity happens throughout the book, although condoms are mentioned multiple times. An interesting read for mature audiences.–Paula J.

Also included from Mathews's original are the musical scores to the birds' songs. Those who can't read music can focus on Mathews's discussion of rhythm and appreciate his enthusiastic descriptions. The Ruffed Grouse is \"the kettledrum,\" the Warbling Vireo is a \"rambling soprano\" and the Hermit Thrush is \"a bird of genius...the last to sing the vesper hymn, and the earliest to open the matutinal chorus at the break of day.\" The Common Grackle-by and large an unpopular bird-makes noises rather than music: he can sound like \"rattling shutters, watchman's rattles, ungreased cart wheels and vibrating wire springs.\" And what of the Purple Finch? Its songs make \"first-rate motives for Spanish tarantelles.\" Color illustrations throughout.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Grade 8 Up—InSnakehead, the world of the ancient Aegean comes alive, and Perseus, the only Greek hero to have a happy ending, gets a compelling treatment. He has long lived in the household of \"Papa Dicty,\" the rightful king of the island Serifos. His mother, Danae, was a princess of Argos, and his father is Zeus. Perseus is less interested in this heritage than he is in keeping Papa Dicty's taverna running. When an earthquake sends refugees to Serifos, including the beautiful Kore (which means \"girl\"), Perseus realizes that things are coming to a head. As Kore, who is actually Andromeda, begins to reveal her secrets, the silent war between Dicty and his brother-usurper Polydectes heightens, and Perseus is sent on a mission to slay the monster Medusa, a once-beautiful woman who caused a feud between Athini and Poseidon, the god to whom Andromeda has been pledged as a sacrifice. Though there are some anachronisms in the story, for the most part the attitudes and understanding of the world experienced by the main characters are true to their setting: Perseus struggles with his identity as half-immortal, and Andromeda with her fate as a sacrifice. Readers of Rick Riordan's \"Percy Jackson\" series (Hyperion) will be delighted to read a tale of that Percy's namesake, and lovers of Greek myth will find plenty of details and hints to keep them involved. The mentions of early Minoan civilization and the islands of Nexos and Fira, now called Santorini, all give the setting a realistic feeling.—Alana Abbott, James Blackstone Memorial Library, Branford, CTCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Events in this airy comedy of manners unroll over a period of six months in a small town in Cheshire, in northwest England. Ellen Jacobs, recently divorced from the husband who abandoned her to run off to the South of France with a younger woman, has been displaced from her comfortable home and upper-middle-class life. Living in a modestly refurbished cottage, she has started a business arranging dried flowers. Sustained by her older, rather eccentric friend Hermione, Ellen is determined not to marry for love again. Instead, she entertains hopes of a secure but dull second marriage to Duncan Carter, her prosperous divorce attorney. Enter young, pregnant and homeless Jo-Jo, who literally crosses Ellen's path as she begs for a handout on a Crantsford street. With little to spare for themselves, Ellen and Hermione take pity on the runaway, offering her food and shelter. Jo-Jo turns out to be domesticated and helpful and to have plenty of common sense; in fact, she becomes the catalyst who helps Ellen to decide between stolid Duncan and Hermione's attractive, artistic godson. Various complications and surprises keep the plot moving briskly.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006Y0QZFO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ultimately, I settled for Your voice needed to be heard . I began heeding my inner voice and connecting with life. I saw life with my 3rd eye and it was glorious. I had only to ask and create those thoughts into the most perfect word... Action . And so after witnessing life at a greater level of understanding, I was called to share this clarity with all who would hear its beautiful voice.   I was born in Los Angeles, CA and raised by a single mom with little to no education. However, what she lacked in education she made up in unconditional love. I came to writing much like most authors, it chose me! Writing became a tangible voice that could be heard and always spoke true. This book How to survive the next 365 takes the reader on a journey of understanding that you truly hold the answers for a better life. My life has thus far been a true testimony of this revelation. I ve owned and operated, even partnered several very successful businesses. 13 years of experience in real estate investing and negotiating terms with hundreds of lenders around the country have compelled me to master The Art of believing in the power within me . It is my hope that this book can do the same for you!  D.K.

Edna becomes Ed, a mean-tempered boy, and the grieving children set off ill-prepared on a journey that many do not survive. What ensues is an unrealistic adventure story of two young people surviving against overwhelming odds. Luck befalls them time and again as they are befriended by a young man named who happens to have extra supplies, make it across the Canadian border, and are reunited with their father. When the family strikes it rich along Bonanza Creek, Billy becomes increasingly discontent as he is continually left out of important family decisions because of his age. He runs away to find his sled dog, who was sold to sustain the family, and makes his way back home, where he tries to break into the newspaper business. Billy's relationships with his sister and father, including the family's eventual reunion, often seem contrived. Several of the characters are based on historical figures, such as Soapy Smith, who orchestrated numerous scams in Skagway. Despite these inclusions, the story remains clichéd and doesn't quite capture the excitement or the harsh realities of the real Klondike gold rush.—Madeline J.

R is an intimidating but powerful program that assumes an intimate knowledge of data formats and terminology not familiar to many language testers. R Through Excel is a highly recommended first step into that program.” (Shiken: JALT Testing& Evaluation SIG Newsletter )“Students, researchers, and others who wish to use R … . This book is essentially a manual for the RExcel software. … Most commonly a page consists of one or more screenshots showing how to use RExcel. The whole book is reproduced in color, on glossy paper. … Readers are guided through the menu system … to see how to carry out common statistical procedures. … For anyone wishing to learn RExcel this book would be a useful purchase.” (David J. Scott, International Statistical Review, Vol. 78 (2), 2010)“R Through Excel offers a concise introduction to statistical analysis for those with little prior experience in statistical software. The text provides a nontechnical introduction to the R programming language and the presentation is helpful for those who are averse to syntax commands. … an excellent manual to have on the shelf for anyone that is interested in integrating R and Excel. … For those in academia who teach introductory statistics and want to use R, this text provides a gentle manner for doing so.” (Philip Okoth, The American Statistician, Vol. 65 (4), November, 2011)“I was very impressed by the layout of the book.

First, Kate investigates the brutal murder of one witness to a botched armored car robbery, followed by the disappearance of the other witness. Then Sam, head of \"a unit within the Utah Department of Corrections called the Special Investigations Branch,\" gets involved because the gang's mastermind is \"prophet\" Walter Bradshaw, a fanatical Mormon polygamist currently awaiting trial for the armored car holdup. Meanwhile, Sam has to cope with a new, excessively by-the-book boss and a lawsuit from his ex-wife seeking custody of their daughter. As personal and bureaucratic tensions almost sidetrack the investigators, Sam and Kate have to prove how smart and stubborn they are. Norman isn't an especially slick author, but he has a good grasp of police procedure and writes with the same dogged, decent persistence that Sam displays.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1905 as a result of the anti-Semitic pogroms of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, his family emigrated to Philadelphia, where his father established a Hebrew school. After graduating from high school and obtaining a bachelor's degree, Kramer tried a variety of occupations, including teaching in his father's school, becoming a writer and becoming a business man.He later stated in his autobiography, concerning the time when he began to approach the age of thirty, still without a career: \"Finally it came to me that I might well go back to my beginnings and try to utilize the Hebrew learning on which I had spent so much of my youth, and relate it in some way to an academic future.\" [citation needed]He then enrolled at Dropsie College of Philadelphia for Hebrew and Cognate Learning, and became passionately interested in Egyptology. He then transferred to the Oriental Studies Department of the University of Pennsylvania, working work with \"the brilliant young Ephraim Avigdor Speiser, who was to become one of the world's leading figures in Near Eastern Studies.\"[citation needed] Speiser was trying to decipher cuneiform tablets of the Late Bronze Age dating from about 1300 BC; it was now that Kramer began his life-long work in understanding the cuneiform writing system.Kramer earned his Ph.D. in 1929, and was famous for assembling tablets recounting single stories that had been distributed between different institutions around the world. He retired from formal academic life in 1968, but remained very active throughout his post-retirement years.In his autobiography, published in 1986 he sums up his accomplishments as follows: \"First, and most important, is the role I played in the recovery, restoration, and resurrection of Sumerian literature, or at least of a representative cross section . . . Through my efforts several thousand Sumerian literary tablets and fragments have been made available to cuneiformists, a basic reservoir of unadulterated data that will endure for many decades to come. Second, I endeavored . . . to make available reasonably reliable translations of many of these documents to the academic community, and especially to the anthropologist, historian, and humanist. quot;(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kteiley; Dallas, Texas Jen's story is so much like many others. The exception, she tells hers. Many other GLBT persons don't do that. She is very candid and honest about her journey. Whether you are Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered or Straight, everyone can find something to like about this book. So many people struggle with their faith and becoming who they are. It doesn't matter if you are gay or not. I think that by reading this book, maybe, at least one can hope, that at least one skeptic will come away with a changed opinion. Being Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual or Transgendered is NOT a choice. Jen proves that. Again and again. If she didn't have the internal struggles that she had with accepting herself, one might see it as a choice. Why would anyone go thru that kind of self evaluation only to be rediculed and spat upon by member's of society, by choice?? No one. Read this... maybe you can help change a mind. J. Michael; Dallas, Texas I just finished this book and loved it! For anyone struggling to be gay and christian, Coming Out Christian is the perfect book for you. Jen Austin fills in the gaps with her own personal struggles of life. It was an easy read filled with so much. Because of this book, I am looking at my own relationships differently: with God, with my parents and friends, and with my comitted lover. I highly suggest picking this book up.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fourteen years before he's found dead with a plastic bag over his head, Cowles was \"cured\" of his homosexual fantasies by the beautiful and ambitious Clara Treadwell, then a resident at the New York Psychiatric Centre. Now Treadwell, currently director of the center, and her former mentor, Harold Dickey, face allegations of malpractice and sexual impropriety arising from Cowles's death. Detective April Woo and Sergeant Mike Sanchez of the NYPD quickly become twin thorns in Treadwell's side, and romance blossoms between them. When someone begins playing malicious gags on Treadwell (used condoms planted in her desk-drawer and daybook), she blames Dickey, whom she seduced and discarded on her way to the top. Treadwell's trouble doubles when a lethal mixture of booze and Elavil kills the embittered man who'd loved and helped her. Woo and Sanchez realize there's a connection between the deaths of Dickey and Cowles, but they must walk a long and tortuous road before getting at the truth. On the way to a predictable ending, Glass provides several surprises, characters motivated by a lively cast of inner demons and, above all, a world where much is not as it initially seems. In Glass's dark vision, the cops need policing, and the shrinks are in dire need of psychiatric help.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It includes step-by-step guidelines on how to apply AI in a variety of organizational situations and shows how it can be used with a wide range of initiatives, such as coaching, leadership development, strategic planning, and teambuilding.\"If there's one book to read on AI, this is it. It provides the context and rationale for this paradigm changing approach to change at any level of system. Buy it, read it, use it and enjoy achieving great results and renewed energy and enthusiasm.\"—Barbara Sloan, director, Organizational Development and Learning, New York University, Langone Medical Center\"Appreciative Inquiry brings the freedom and creativity of AI together with the 'nuts and bolts' of how to actually do it all. It contains everything I would want to have as a fresh practitioner, from potential designs to sample questions and excellent Case Stories.\"—David Shaked, founder and CEO, Almond Insight, United Kingdom\"This book serves as a complete roadmap for those interested in the philosophy and practice of Appreciative Inquiry.

With measured anxiety he joins a trans-Caribbean crossing on a custom 48-foot sailboat with “deep soul,” captained by a man who suffers from Parkinson’s disease. The story begins in mid-action when the sailboat gets thrashed upon the rocks. Shubaly remarks that disasters “unfurl slowly, with a series of small mistakes--mere miscalculations--which though obvious after the fact, are easily overlooked at the time.” He is subtle in showing the shipwreck, and the voyage itself, as an analogy for his own state of affairs: his writing and musical ambitions squandered to booze while the death of a friend weighs on his conscience. His heroic act after the shipwreck is so well described, so looming, so filled with bitter irony, that it will stay with me for years to come. With its wondrous arc, this narrative feels deeply authentic because Shubaly acknowledges his character flaws and demons with simple honesty, and yet he also owns them with a misguided pride that suggests the impossibility of change. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00J8HJW8C"], "rank": 385080, "title": "Shipwrecked (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Mishka Shubaly", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 52.0}

The divers are essential to the survival of the village as the pearls and shells they gather are used for trading. All is not well, however, as Spanish conquistadors want only gold from the New World. When ships full of it sink in a storm, the divers are taken to recover the treasure, and Culca uses her nimble wits and unflagging bravery to save her brother's life. Female roles and Spanish colonial exploitation of land and people are the themes of this brief account. The dual role of the church is shown through the contrast of a humble, sincere friar and the ostentatious church of the bishop. Character development is limited and flat except for Culca and the friar. When she takes on the powerful church and government of Colonial Spain, realism slides away. However, the simple plot and dialogue will hold readers' interest. Chief recommendations for the book are a simple vocabulary and sentence structure, single plot line, and nondidactic tone. Culca comes through as a strong female voice; issues are presented but are not belabored. Useful for younger or less capable readers, this might provide an opening for discussion of the Spanish in the New World. RealisRealistic black-and-white drawings appear in every chapter. --Gail Richmond, Point Loma High School, San DiegoCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 341972, "title": "The Diving Bell", "author": "Todd  Strasser", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Perceptions of each side for its enemy were stereotypical and\nfamiliar. Graphic representations of wounds,illnesses and deaths,although known\nto us as witnesses to war,were shocking and seemed almost surreal to me,but\nI've never been in battle. I was intrigued by Camp's characterization of\nvarious individuals on both sides,mostly officers, and he has demonstrated\neffectively that \"numbskulls\" abound. The United States Marines again\nemerge,in my mind, as the best fighting force in the world and I am happy that\nthey are on our side. Colonel Camp's book helped me to sort out some of my\nlongstanding confusion about the Vietnam war and I am planning to read more\nfrom him as a way to continue my education in this area.", "related": [], "rank": 872959, "title": "Echo Among Warriors: A Novel of Marines In the Vietnam War", "author": "Dick Camp", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You would think by adding something like spinach in a popsicle it would not taste good but it does. --YourOrganicChild.com - April 11 2011I think getting creative with ice pops by adding healthy food is a great way to introduce your kids to new foods, new flavors, and new textures while they are experimenting with what they like!

As a sophomore in high school, William elected to include Creative Writing as part of his curriculum. The teacher would often allow students to share their work by instructing students to read an excerpt and pass their work on to the next student. William's watching other students work pile up on a desk while one of his classmates became enthralled with his work gave him a sense of pride. That teacher asked William to stay after class one day and suggested that he pursue writing as a career. During the course of the conversation, she made it perfectly clear that she had told only two other students this in her entire career. She instructed William not to tell other students of their conversation. In 1977, when a writer's options were very limited, William took his teachers advice with a grain of salt. Over thirty years later, acting on his wife's encouragement, William used his free time, although somewhat limited, to write his first novel. \"The Chartersville Story\" took over a year to write. It is a suspense thriller that everyone can enjoy. The author sincerely hopes that you will enjoy this book and  encourages your reviews.", "related": [], "rank": 2957742, "title": "The Chartersville Story", "author": "William Lewton", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thankfully, this apparent conclusion benefits from having to tie together the various threads, resulting in a tighter, more coherent story line. With the teen Resistance in tatters, magical siblings Whit and Wisty are forced to split up to achieve two seemingly impossible goals: save their maybe-not-dead-after-all parents from the Shadowland and destroy The One once and for all. Though the duo’s endless array of powers (healing, creating food, morphing bodies, reading minds, shooting flame, freezing people in place) drains most of the tension from otherwise decently constructed action scenes, Patterson’s trademark short chapters at least keep things swift. Meanwhile, the series hits its highest point of interest when it finally gives a glimpse into the childhood of The One. A better-than-expected ending to a by-the-numbers trilogy. We can hope it’s a trilogy, anyway. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Patterson, one of the best-selling authors of all time, is review-proof. The first two volumes set the tone: heavy advertising, graphic-novel supplementation, best-seller lists. Expect the same.

So, the first several chapters are basically a VERY brief overview of Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity's histories (and even briefer views on some of the other religions) and their views on evil. Very brief, but a fair amount of information. The rest of the book gets into an amazing amount of detail on those religions views of evil, as well as the scientific views of it. Makes for a surprisingly good read. I say surprisingly, because I figured it would be fairly plain, but it actually did grab my attention and held it all the way through. The author does a great job of discussing this and enjoyably so. The author also was great about noting her facts, and it makes me want to dig further with the other authors mentioned.I did want to mention that the author is from New Zealand, so some of the English spelling is quirky as compared to American English.

The Beery family resided in Pleasant Hill, Ohio, where its patriarch farmed until he was 82 years of age. Attending school at Covington and Pleasant Hill, Jesse worked on his family farm where as a very young man he discovered his intense interest in handling animals. It did not take long for him to realize that his skills with animals were rare, and he decided to visit various areas of the country in order to display his techniques. No matter if they saw him at an exposition, a county fair or a private function, everyone who saw him work found his abilities to be truly impressive. After 16 years of impressing spectators with his talents, Jesse eventually wound up with a greater volume of demand for his work than he could handle. Jesse Beery made the decision in 1905 to go back to his hometown and start an educational enterprise he would call the Jesse Beery School of Correspondence in Horsemanship. The main objective was to help others gain the skills and mastery that he possessed. Scores of individuals were astounded by his common sense horse training methods, and even now he is considered to be one of very few horse trainers to have had this kind of far-reaching effect. In addition to his unique talents in the realm of horse training, he was the inventor of an array of tools intended to help gain mastery over the animals he oversaw. Beery's assembly of tools, bridles and bits have long enjoyed a reputation among many as being tremendously useful. Those wishing to rapidly and properly train a horse will undoubtedly learn from Jesse Beery's techniques, as his time-tested principles are known to be some of the only really helpful ways to achieve these goals. The correspondence school was inundated with scores of letters and notes throughout its history containing endless gratitude and respect for the techniques promulgated by its founder. Though Jesse Beery passed away in early 1945, his legacy in the world of horse training goes undiminished. There is no accurate way to gauge the breadth of impact Beery's teachings have had, though the many thousands of students who have learned his approach serve as a lasting legacy. The name Jesse Beery is one that will be heard in the world of horse training for the foreseeable future, as he was a true pioneer, scholar, inventor and genius in the field.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As always, you are way too kind.MC -Quite the collection of plot elements including globalization, biopiracy, illegal arms dealing, indigenous tribes, sneakers, shoulder-fired missiles, dense jungle, hang gliders, poison darts, tequila, freshly baked pastries, the fountain of youth and...how should I put this...virility.   How on earth did you manage to maintain a coherent story line?BR -I got the initial idea after the devastating tsunami hit India. I started thinking about the rebuilding process that would be required as well as some of the charlatans who inevitably surface every time disaster strikes. I already had some strong opinions on the impact and implications of globalization and then I started doing research on biopiracy. The character of Sir Bentley Carruthers, sneaker magnate and exploiter of the poor on four continents, began to take shape. Once I get to know my antagonist, the storyline usually flows from there. But like most of my books, this one had to percolate awhile.MC - Sir Bentley is one of those guys you love to hate.  He is enormously entertaining. One of my favorite scenes is Bentley trying to rally his troops for battle. Pacing, clapping his hands, trying to get that motley crew's attention. And he's the manufacturer of the Cloudlifter. The sleeker, non-squeaker sneaker. The marketing slogans you sprinkled through the book were very funny. I can almost see the commercials.BR - Me too. Kind of scary isn't it?MC -When I figured out what Freak was planning with the hang gliders armed with missiles, one of them powered by a riding lawn mower engine, I wondered if you'd be able to pull that off.BR - Hey, you can't win a ground war without adequate air support. (laughs)MC -I also enjoyed the tribe and appreciated your depiction of their customs and values.  You were respectful and never portrayed the notion that non-Western equates to inferior. And I loved the way you used the parallel of the introduction of new technology in both Western and indigenous environments. As in the West, Chief and Bantu are always on the lookout for new technology that might make their lives easier.BR - Thanks.  I'm very happy to hear from you that it didn't come across as disrespectful or ham-fisted.MC - There's a theme running through the book about what you seem to feel is the inevitability of globalization and everything that comes with it.BR - Yeah, I'm not sure I would even use the term inevitable since it is pretty much a done deal. Like the guys in the Posse, I'm just hopeful we can minimize the damage. I wanted that theme to emerge from the story and it's one of the book's key messages.  Well, that and Esmeralda's point about quitting tequila in the morning because it fucks up her whole day.MC - (laughs) And Buddy Quizling tossing an empty beer can into the jungle was such a casual gesture I almost missed it.BR - Yeah.  I call it 'the incremental creep of cultural encroachment.' In a couple of years, Buddy and the other scumbags would be paying locals peanuts to clean the place up because it's a mess.MC - Since you brought her up, let talk about Esmeralda. Will you be bringing her back?BR - I wouldn't be surprised if she came back with her new partner, Piqûre.MC - The French guy who's the lead singer and bass player for a Police tribute band called Les Gendarmes?BR - You know my philosophy, if you're going to take the time to create a character, no matter how small, don't waste them.MC - Knowing you as I do, I figured there must be some reason you named him Piqûre, so I looked it up. I love being right.BR - (laughs) Yes, Piqûre is the French word for sting. Well done. I'm a huge Sting fan and I was actually listening to him when I was writing Piqûre's first scene. I was going to keep that a secret and let people figure it out themselves. Way to go, Michele. Now you've blown it. (laughs)MC - We've talked about this before but I wanted to ask you again. Don't you worry about being labeled, perhaps even pigeonholed, as someone who just writes funny books?BR - I do write funny books.MC - You know what I mean. Do you worry about not being taken serious as a writer simply because your books are so funny?BR -I appreciate the question because I do get that label from some people. How good can he be? He's just a comedy guy. The Damaged Posse series deals with important questions.  And the Posse members all have serious baggage they're carrying around as they try to do the right thing. And that makes the series more interesting. Sneaker World deals with globalization, biopiracy, weapon's technology and the exploitation of indigenous people under the guise of development rather than the rampant greed and out of control capitalism it truly is.  As a writer, I obviously have choices about how I approach issues I find interesting. My primary intent is to entertain my readers but, of course, it's part of my job to offer some perspective.MC -The humor, rather that coming across as jokey, consistently comes from the characters and the situations they find themselves in. Sneaker World, given the theme of inevitably we talked about before, has an almost melancholy tone to it.BR -Well, when it comes to the planet these days, I'm not overly optimistic.  But I feel better when I can carve a pathway through potentially dismal inevitabilities with a funny narrative.  Humor offers hope. I could have gone the other way and written hundreds of dark pages about the bleakness of the world around us. But I have no interest in writing books like that. I'd rather take on serious issues and find a comedic thread that makes the same points, but not make my readers want to slit their wrists halfway through the story. But it's always a challenge since good comedy is very hard to write.MC - Booga, wooga, nooga.BR - (laughs) Now that's funny. Thanks for taking the time to chat.

From the formative days ofSneak Previews, the earliest incarnation of what would becomeAt the Movies, the show’s hosts--both based at Chicago newspapers--were opposing personalities. Siskel was a confident, pragmatic business guy; Ebert, by contrast, was a whimsical writer who charmed his peers and could care less about the show's ratings. Naturally, they didn't get along, at least at first. As one associate director recalls inEnemies, \"The crew always suspected that if either Gene or Roger made a better point during the cross-talk, the other would bungle the readout of it on purpose, forcing them to do it over again.\" But in the tension there was chemistry, and in that chemistry was the formula for an unlikely hit show. WithEnemies, Josh Schollmeyer, an executive editor atPlayboy, has reported a cohesive oral history, culled entirely from interviews with former producers, crew members, and friends involved with the show. Perhaps this is a predictable way to close this review, but how could one expect anything less from a love/hate relationship as compelling as Siskel and Ebert's?

Using an electrical conductor to make contact with them, he finds these \"friends\" to be very helpful. So, naturally, when his family takes a seaside vacation, he turns to them to warn him about the presence of sharks. For days he hears nothing, but eventually learns that the beauty marks (female) have overthrown the freckles (male) and refuse to allow them to speak. Without the support of his freckles, Adam is too fearful to go in the water. Moping on the beach, he finds a new friend in a lonely boy who was blinded in an accident, and together they both grow in self-acceptance and confidence. The strong portrayal of their relationship contrasts with the utterly preposterous plot. The gender war between the adult-sounding beauty marks and freckles stretches credibility to the breaking point?their stilted talk of revolution seems out of place and dated. Nonetheless, Napoli does a creditable job of developing her characters. Adam's family life and the characters' feelings, relationships, and growth are well handled and believable.

He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton's Wade Center Seven.    After his death, most of MacDonald's books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald's reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century.   MacDonald's most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald's prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: \"I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.\" Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage.   MacDonald's writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald's novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis's later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia.   In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis' s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis's words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis' s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman's influence in his own life, MacDonald's name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable.   A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton's Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald's sermon extracts. MacDonald's name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips's work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald's stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald's books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime.   Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A new series features 15-year-old Wakara Sheridan, of American Indian and Irish descent, who lives with her family on a ranch in present-day Oregon. InWild Fire, Wakara is still grieving over her mother's death from a car accident a few months earlier. Helping her two brothers and her father get their lodge ready for summer visitors, Wakara sees how her mother's death is affecting each of them in a different way. She becomes friends with the new housekeeper, Anne Lightfoot, a Nez Perce from the reservation in Idaho, as well as Colin, a teenager hired to help with the horses, but she doesn't fully embrace their faith in God until she and her six-year-old brother narrowly escape a deadly forest fire. InBlind Fury, Wakara and her family are back at their ranch for the school year. Glad to have Anne as their live-in housekeeper and happy to see the family becoming strong once again, Wakara risks her life to find her brother and father when a sudden blizzard traps them in the mountains. Although Anne seems too good to be true and Wakara's struggles are too easily solved by her faith, the series has just the right amount of action and romance.Karen HuttCopyright © American Library Association.

While Bernardo received a life sentence, Homolka made a plea deal and served just 12 years. She was freed in 2005, and Canadians became obsessed with the whereabouts and life of this serial killer turned loose. In the Kindle SingleFinding Karla, Canadian journalist Paula Todd goes in search of Homolka, who disappeared in 2007. It's a quest that is, in a word, unnerving. With the skills of a detective and the determination of a bounty hunter, she travels thousands of miles to find someone who has gone to great lengths to be unfindable. Ostensibly, Todd is tracking her down for research on a book about released convicts. But really, Todd's mission is to fulfill the collective curiosity of a nation. The narrative snowballs with suspense towards the moment when Todd and Homolka meet face-to-face. The encounter is tense, even hostile at times, and it's rendered exquisitely, revealing the contradictions in a killer's personality as they escape in bursts of raw and tender emotion.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IMNJXLO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 3.1667, "rating_total": 38.0}

Historian/sleuth Arnold Landon, last seen in A Wisp of Smoke , ventures to Northumbria for the Department of Museums and Antiquities to investigate several medieval buildings, and there views a painting of Christ strikingly similar to images found on the Shroud of Turin. Landon's DMA predecessor disappeared shortly after examining the buildings; then the missing man's journalist wife and her lover are discovered murdered. Aided by romantic novelist Jane Wilson, the ever-bashful Arnold investigates, sweeping readers along in the fascinating process of dating the painting and unraveling mysteries both past and present. Lewis, who knows his historic architecture and can spot a false ceiling from a fair distance, deftly metes out the lore while keeping his plot primary.

Austin, a veterinarian, shares Joanna's love of nature, and  the two find much common ground as they team up to help clean up the  beaches and save the native birds and wildlife from the encroachment of  civilization. Can Joanna let go of her grief and love Austin in his own  right?

While he proclaims his near reverence for Hemingway as a writer, he gives the impression that Papa was a thoroughly obnoxious human being with an aggressively proprietary attitude toward anything or anyone that interested him. And Schulberg's view of Ali, the man who lived up to his own billing as a child of the 1960s, \"the fifth Beatle,\" is a perceptive analysis. But excellent as the essays are, the reportage that fills out the book is pedestrian.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maneuvering for a date with his ex-wife, Derek O'Reilly invites his five-year-old nephew on a fishing trip and persuades his ex, Connie, to come, along with the 14-month-old twins she's babysitting. Aware that a bumbling gang of three crooks is on the loose, Derek and Co. are dismayed when they stumble onto the baddies in a farmhouse. The kids and the couple find themselves more or less held hostage, though mentally challenged robber Petey has more fun playing with the kids than guarding them, while his partners are grateful that one of their captives can actually cook.

When the economy collapsed in 2007 Joshua switched careers and dedicated himself to faithfully writing every morning before work.  He established The Writers JAM, a peer group of active writers, with several friends a short time later and was soon convinced to abandon Riella. 30 days later he completed the first draft of The Footbridge.  He has now written four novels, two novellas, and a handful of short stories. His favorite thing about writing is discovering a new world or new characters and breathing them into existence, then dashing their hopes and dreams only to raise them up again to be more than they ever were before. He enjoys carefully crafting a story to capture his readers interest and weave a situation which inspires and motivates then leaves them fulfilled and satisfied. Joshua gets ideas for new stories far faster than he can keep up, and looks forward to the day when he can spend whole weeks in an obscure beach house writing. For now he lives in a log home at the mouth of a beautiful canyon in Utah with his wife and five children. He enjoys reading, writing, building new things like the UTV in his shop, and when he has time, gardening and fixing things around the house.", "related": [], "rank": 3481708, "title": "The Footbridge", "author": "Joshua Chapman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unlike other authors who completed entire novels before serialisation, Dickens often created the episodes as they were being serialized. The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by cliffhangers to keep the public looking forward to the next installment. The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone out of print.His work has been praised for its realism, mastery of prose, and unique personalities by writers such as George Gissing, Leo Tolstoy and G.

Amid the high-stakes takeover, someone on the inside will apparently stop at nothing to see his best interests realized. She tries to use the data to convince her superiors at NEI, of the impending doom, but a handful of male superiors mysteriously want her out of the firm and off the case--for her own safety, they say.She's also handling a broken heart: Her ex-fiance Stephen left her when she refused to give up her career to marry him. But fortunately, one of her compassionate, newly minted superiors apparently has a thing for her.This intelligent read broaches the early 2000's landscape of mergers and unpredictable financial markets, as well as an array of wealthy, elusive guys, including Gabrielle's eleventh-hour lover, Jarin. She's also aided by Carson, a resourceful security guard-cum-G-Man who helps her navigate some tricky terrain.Although the tone and dialogue can come off as a bit too dramatic at times (Question: \"What the hell do you want?\" Answer: \"Your resignation\"), the well-portrayed world is thoroughly amusing and seemingly TV-ready.An intelligent thriller that's a bit overdone.--KirkusReviews.com", "related": ["B009N3YRE0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.5, "rating_total": 21.0}

Ed., a life-long learner and teacher, writes about topics that transcend the self in order to guide others in what she has learned.

She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": [], "rank": 1926013, "title": "Patience Through Perspective: Learn the Art of Mindful Waiting", "author": "Carrie Soneji", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  - she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has trained and instructed kickboxing and total conditioning at two of the nation’s leading fitness centers; LA FITNESS and GOLD’S GYM. A staunch believer in an active lifestyle, his motto is: it is easier to stay fit and healthy than it is to get fit and healthy. Keith developed Combocising in 1996 as a result of experience, inspiration and a healthy dose of kismet. The program was perfected through research of various physical fitness and sensual resources including Healing Love through the Tao, the Kama Sutra, and Five Languages of Love. But Combocising is not simply a book based on sex, says Keith. It’s an exercise program which helps facilitate communication, intimacy, and the ability for people to get to know one another. Always a supporter of people having control over their own health, Keith believes the same philosophy runs true in relationships – especially when it comes to communication. “My wife and I always worked out with one another,” Keith says. “It gave us an opportunity to continue our conversations with one another.” Keith’s background includes serving seven years in the United States Navy as an electricians mate second class petty officer. After being honorably discharged, he attended community college before completing a five year apprenticeship program in electrical construction. Keith has been certified though the American Council on Exercise since 2000. He then graduated from the Pennsylvania Institute of Massage Therapy in September 2001 and later opened Relentless Souls Inc., a fitness and health services provider, located in Allentown, PA. He and his wife of 17 years still practice Combocising two to three times a week.", "related": ["B00J1AOJGG"], "rank": 3235613, "title": "Combocising", "author": "Keith  Riddick", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though forbidden to speak with foreign journalists, he agreed to talk with Martin. They first met in London when Weiwei’s landmark Sunflower Seeds exhibition opened at the Tate. Martin sets the scene with a brisk overview of twentieth-century Chinese history and Weiwei’s family’s banishment to the Gobi Desert after his renowned poet father ran afoul of Mao. He also illuminates Weiwei’s ingenious, often collaborative art; pivotal role in catalyzing China’s contemporary art movement; and daring, innovative activism. In the stunned aftermath of his illegal detention, Weiwei recounts his terrifying and absurd ordeal, during which, handcuffed to a chair, he explained conceptual art to his surprisingly respectful interrogators and sympathized with the impoverished and oppressed young guards. Martin’s vivid and affecting portrait attests both to Weiwei’s now severely restricted circumstances and his undiminished spirit and conviction as an artist of conscience and a resounding champion for freedom and democracy, responsibility and justice. --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After failing to make the grade as a professional football player, he spent much of his early years traveling, hitch-hiking around Europe and North Africa and then heading to Asia. His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months.  He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year. ISABELLA is due to be published in 2013. He likens his fiction most closely to Ken Follett – books with romance and high adventure, drawn from many periods of history", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was outspoken, but her flights of fantasy sometimes got in the way of the more detailed work of school, making her an average student (day dreamer). As a young adult, she did what was expected at the time for a girl, dating and getting married, but never let her fantasy world get completely away. As her children grew, she would engage them in interactive role-play while on walks, thus making them a part of her dream games.

It was during that time that he became addicted to heroine, and subsequently, was one of the first attendees in the Naval rehab in Nha Be, Viet Nam. After the service he hitch-hiked around the country working various jobs and having many life experiences. His three wives survived their marriages to him as he suffered through more alcohol and drug addictions. Rick has since been sober and clean for 10 years. He had been in a wonderful relationship for the last five years, and has finally found meaningful spirituality, for which he is greatly grateful. Rick has two beautiful daughters and three grandchildren. He lives in Charlotte, TN.

I've always loved science fiction, one of my first memories of watching TV was of a young Captain Kirk in some kind of trouble. It wasn't easy being an expert trekkie in high school. But once I discovered Ray Bradbury the sky was the limit. I moved on to fantasy with great authors like Tolkien, Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore. Eventually it occurred to me to start putting my stories in writing. I am constantly amazed at how my stories seem to write themselves. I write like most people read. Once a story is done, I am lost until I begin another. I currently live in a small town at the base of the beautiful mountains in Utah. I couldn't ask for a more inspiring venue.

Personal note: Why I wrote Date Night Conversations As a therapist, counselor, and coach I have worked with hundreds of couples who have struggled with their relationship. Often I find that the source of pain is in their past and they are not aware of it and don't know how to get out of their cycles of pain. It is very rewarding when I can help a couple stop blaming each other, understand the real issues, and learn how to create the conditions in which love and intimacy can flourish. I want all couple to have this experience. This book is written to teach you how to have the conversations you need to get out of your own cycles of pain and deepen and strengthen your marriage. It is designed as a stand-alone book and also as a companion workbook to my online home study course(www.reimaginemarriage.com). It is my sincere hope that your marriage will be enriched through these resources. I invite your questions, comments, and feedback.

Yes, really, 1979. He’s an old geezer. And sensitive about his age. He seems to think that younger readers may wonder how someone who has to have hit the big six oh could possibly have something interesting to offer. Maybe to the other Baby Boomers. But the man can’t program his smart TV. He doesn’t do Facebook or Twitter, he barely knows how to make phone calls on his I Phone.  On the other hand, the things that really matter, character and relationships and emotion and humor, he has that stuff down.  An avid reader, he goes through a half dozen book a month, now mostly on Kindle, but still an occasional actual book with words printed on paper. And like many of us, he always thought I could do that. I could write! What a great way to make a living! Making up stories, entertaining people. Like the Master, King Stephen, keeping people up late and night so they go to work bleary eyed and dull. What a concept! The trick is writing something well. Something lively and entertaining, with characters and motivations, and emotions you can understand, and plots that make you want to see what the hell is going to happen, enough to keep someone up late. That takes a talent for writing. Does he have it? You be the judge. Be careful. You may be sleeping through the alarm. James likes crime/mystery/thrillers because he knows criminals as well as anyone can, after twenty-five years in prison. Most aren’t sociopaths, but the few are terrifying. It’s a theme addressed in his new novel, Capital Punishment. He also likes science fiction because who can say what’s realistic in another world or time or dimension. It’s a genre ripe for world saving and special powers and time travel. Anything can happen! James has been married to the same patient woman for 39 years. They married young, he says, but it wasn’t that young. Before the Ph.D.. They’ve raised four children, all grown and pursuing their own careers. James and Patsy live in Canon City, Colorado. He enjoys the things that Colorado allows, hiking, fishing, ATV riding, camping, traveling to visit the kids, gardening and carpentry. He has three books available on Kindle and CreateSpace, and hopes to finish a dozen more before settling into the old rocker on the porch.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maybe 1935 wasn’t the best year to do this—deep in the Great Depression—as it seems half the country is on the road with him. But this is his life now, and he’s not sure where to turn next. Lolly Prescott is feeling every moment of a hot, dry, penniless summer. Life was never exciting before, but now she’s just. . .trapped. So when her brothers carry a half-dead man in the front door and onto the couch, she doesn’t know whether to run or just give in and give up. As Colin struggles to regain his memory, the Prescotts’ financial situation reaches the breaking point. Can the attraction between Colin and Lolly grow into a relationship amid such uncertainty? Can it survive when all seems lost? “Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord.” Jeremiah 17:7", "related": [], "rank": 1567987, "title": "Kind-Hearted Woman (Truly Yours Digital Editions Book 872)", "author": "Janet Spaeth", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The players' voices emit every nuance required to let listeners experience the swashbuckling deeds of the famous heroic threesome and the boy called D'Artagnan who wants to join their ranks. When the young man arrives in Paris with the wish to enlist with the King's Musketeers, he finds himself challenged to three duels in his first afternoon in the city by men who turn out to be Porthos, Aramis, and Athos-the Three Musketeers. Instead of fighting against them, the twists of fate have D'Artagnan battling for them against the evil Cardinal Richelieu's guards. After demonstrating his worth with a sword, D'Artagnan proves more of his mettle by journeying to England to foil a plot to embarrass France's Queen Anne, the former Anne of Austria. D'Artagnan saves his queen but loses the woman he loves, so he seeks vengeance and, in turn, instills himself firmly in the ranks of the Musketeers. The flavor of the original is evident even though this abridged version includes only highlights in its retelling.Joanne K.

I was pleased that some of the theories presented early in the novel were revisited and expanded on further in.The story of Kallad and the spaceship I.D.84 is a great way for Erik Morland to present his theories and the physics in this novel go hand in hand with the storytelling, overshadowing the story only occasionally. Kallad is faced with interesting moral dilemmas right from the start of the novel and we can see from the choices he makes the nature of his character. The writing style of the book is fast paced, precise and at times is what I can only describe as abrupt. The book does not neglect the science part of a science fiction novel and it also demands that we look unflinchingly at the nature of humanity and how our actions now can have consequences lasting trillions of years. I thoroughly enjoyed, reading this book and learning about Erik Morland's ideas and theories. For anyone beginning to read the book I would say that sticking with it to the end is worthwhile and very rewarding.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2373219, "title": "To the edge of the universe (The future vision series) eBook", "author": "erik morland", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has traveled widely, spending some time in Central Asia having various adventures, one of which was getting married in the traditional Kyrgyz way.
