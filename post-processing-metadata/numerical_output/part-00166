Never having to sleep, Tanner has plenty of time to become interested in hopeless causes, help oppressed groups, learn obscure languages and travel to exotic locales. The U.S. government has used his undercover talents in the past, but in this fourth novel in the Tanner series he's working for himself. Missing in Thailand is his latest girlfriend, singer Tuppence Ngawa, who is half African and half American and speaks in a bizarre '60s jive. Tuppence and the jazz musicians with whom she was on tour have been kidnapped by Communist rebels, shortly after a major burglary of the Thai royal jewelry collection. Tanner rushes to Tuppence's rescue, only to be taken prisoner by another rebel group in the dense Thai jungle. Tanner escapes from a bamboo cage perched in a tree with the help of a small, comical Thai who believes that somehow Tanner can help him finally find a woman who will relieve him of his virginity. This early Block novel is very much of its time, very '60s, with eerie echoes of the treatment of American POWs in Vietnam. It's still a great pleasure today.

He didn't mention that the rushed toilette that repaired her hair and garments didn't do anything to remedy her smell. The odor was almost as much the point as her insistence that he spill some of his load on the damned gown that cost more than a winter's worth of food for a tribe. Odor times two only supplied more proof of her rite of passage - screwing the Savage Lord.The fondling marked the finale of their rough and tumble romp. When she'd fluffed his staff until it plumped like a well-stuffed sausage, she stood back to survey the results. She nodded and said, \"There, that should do it,\" before she swept through the rear nook and past the shrubbery without a word of farewell. He watched her steps temper like her demeanor so that she was every bit the naughty, haughty bitch as she re-entered the ballroom by a small side door popularly known as the party pass.Colt snorted as his hands returned to the familiar task of buttoning his loaded pants. He shook out the straight black hair that brushed his shoulders and sauntered out the front entrance. At the top of the terrace steps stood three young lordlings doing the thing that invariably, inevitably and immediately wiped the twinkle from Colt's baby blues. They wore the regal pout - tilted chins, scrunched noses and raised brows. In the hopes of avoiding the sort of confrontation that led to flying fists and hours of lectures from his father, Colt veered to the far side of the stairway. It didn't surprise him much when the lordlings responded by fanning out so he couldn't brush by.\"Who was the second passenger on the red stick tonight, Haversham?\" Chilton Asquith asked in the lilting tones of one who's already had a couple too many.Colt raised his own brows, bit the inside of his cheek and counted to ten, all of which allowed him to respond fairly calmly. \"Fuck you, Asswipeth and by the way, you're one off. Since you're keeping score and all.\"For him, the response approached the sedate. Colt pushed skinny Chilton aside only to have the other two sturdier lads close ranks. He sighed and stopped.\"Babs Keeworth,\" Nigel Davies informed the other two. \"Saw her sneaking in the party pass just before Walking Dick strutted out the front.\"\"What the hell did you call me?\"\"It's tradition among your people, isn't it?\" Ellery Edmonds asked in the entitled tone of one who expected his old man to kick it any time now. \"Adopting a name for your most important body part?\"\"Most important? It's the only bloody part that the females give a fig about. I hear he does some Injun tricks with that red stick that drive 'em wild,\" Davies said, giving Colt a sudden shove backward into a small alcove. \"Of course, that's not what pisses me off.\"Colt's temper didn't wait to hear what pissed off the man grinding him into a wall. He led with his right and jerked his left hand clear of Edmonds' limp-wristed grip. He followed with a left to Davies' slightly chunky gut. It backed the belligerent bastard far enough away for him to take a step forward before running footsteps heralded a newcomer to the group and he winced. He didn't have to look up to know that rescue hadn't arrived. In this crowd, help wasn't coming unless one of the so-called ladies developed a mighty serious itch. The thought pricked him, packing a larger wallop than Barton Quicke's fist. He'd have doubled over himself except that now four sets of hands shoved him into the wall.\"Haversham causing trouble, lads?\" Barton asked.\"He's interrupting my explanation of what pisses me off about the females panting after his package,\" Davies replied. \"Now I get to finish. You see, Walking Dick,\" Davis said, placing a hand on his shoulder that was only half-angry, \"I get tea pot ticked that the redskin chants or spells or voodoo you use to mesmerize the fairer sex keeps them adding your name to the guest lists. The females send the invitations.\"\"My name is on their bloody guest lists because I'm the son of an Earl,\" Colt snarled. \"I have the same status as all of you. After all, I'm a lord too.\"The four bloods chortled, their glee nearly allowing him to slip away. But only nearly because they slammed him back against the wall after a half step. At least it got Davies' paw off his shoulder. The part of the paw that hadn't been angry made his stomach churn.\"You're a savage, half-breed who has less blue blood than my bastard whelps,\" Asquith replied. \"All my little bastards at least have British blood.\"\"You're a lord too,\" Quicke smiled, shook his head and made a tssking noise with his tongue. \"I think you actually believe that you belong. You naive little sod. You're not even the lord of your pants.\"", "related": ["B00KJ7RZGQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1978, Richard Foster's Celebration of Discipline brought other practices such as meditation, fasting and confession to evangelical attention, and since then publishers have released a spate of spiritual discipline books by evangelical Protestants who like to read Catholic authors. Winebrenner continues this tradition, referencing Catholic writers such as Thomas Merton, Fran‡ois F‚nelon and Henri Nouwen along with Protestants including Eugene Peterson, Oswald Chambers and Dallas Willard. Director of the Dallas Christian Writers Guild, she has an easy-to-follow workmanlike approach, laced with homey illustrations about horses and football and children leaving for college. To the frequently taught disciplines of study, prayer, worship, fellowship and service, she adds a dozen others, including humility, chastity, secrecy, silence and celebration. All disciplines, she repeatedly emphasizes, have one goal: a passionate romance with God. On nearly every page she writes rhapsodically about God's personal love, connecting it with whatever discipline she is presenting. For example, in meditation, \"my mind becomes filled with awareness of God's tender love for me, and I am quickly at peace, quickly settled and almost instantly relieved of any desire to think of anything but God.\" As a basic introduction to various Christian disciplines as well as an inspirational paean to God's love, this book will appeal to evangelical women (and likely men) who might be put off by the scholarly approach of some of its predecessors.

By the end of the six-month-long adventure, the family had anchored out every night but two, and made ocean passages as long as five nights. -We challenged ourselves in meaningful ways that brought us together as a family. The whole idea of the video and book is to share how other families can experience this kind of great adventure. --SEA, May 2003For every boater out there who has dreamed of sailing away, this little hot-off-the-press paperback is a must buy. Why? Because it is a clearly written log of one Northwest family's sailing adventures and a detailed how- to-do-it manual. Many of us talk (or dream) of taking off to cruise through warm seas. But when it comes to acting, we don t have the money, or the right boat, or the time, the skills, the, the, the . . . The Rink family didn't either. In fact, they were not even experienced sailors. While they both taken sailing and pilotage courses, they had never cruised off shore. They had kids in school and profitable work that they enjoyed (mostly). But they dropped, massaged, and changed their commitments to pursue something new to all of us that would be difficult to complete. -We wanted a trip that would present problems and challenges that we could solve only as a family.- While the book loosely describes their overall voyage, it really is a compendium of information and advice. There are chapters on such topics as: anchoring, money, health and safety, food, our favorite places, shipping the boat home and so on. Rink includes tidbits like: Cleanliness is a big deal when buying and storing food. We managed to keep Mermaid completely cockroach free, but is was a lot of work. We saw more than a few boats that were infested with ants or cockroaches. There is even a section titled: -Calendar - laying out exactly what to do as well as telling when and where to be during your own Caribbean adventure. The equipment list alone is worth the book price. For anyone gravitating toward a similar adventure, this paperback (and their video) is a treasure. --Pugetmarine web siteIf you've ever wondered how a family of novice sailors can take a year off and successfully cruise the Caribbean and the Bahamas, , read this book. Phil and Nancy Rink and their daughter, Lena, 12, and their son, Pender, 9, move aboard Mermaid, a Beneteau Oceanis 400 in St. Martin and chronicle their experience, often through the eyes of their children.

The duo travel to Huckerston, a port town where wreckers are at work. Michael's distant cousin and love interest, the fair Rosamund, has run away to Huckerston to join her love, Rudy, a tightrope walker who is missing some toes. He is a traveling player with Mr. Makejoye's troupe, which the knight and squire join. Much of the book's humor and appeal comes from the friendship and interplay between Michael and Fisk, the former well-intentioned but foolhardy, while the latter is more reality-based and cynical. They tell the story in alternating chapters as they encounter murder, piracy, robbery, and all sorts of chaos while they try to expose the wreckers, find the loot, and woo Rosamund. Michael is able to see magic in objects and has the gift of animal handling, which is helpful in offsetting his gift of attracting trouble. The time period feels medieval, yet street lamps are mentioned, as is Fisk's former job as a bouncer in a tavern. This incongruity adds to the book's humor. A blend of fantasy, adventure, and mystery, with a large cast of characters and a fast-paced plot, this installment will appeal most to fans of the previous titles.—Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, MECopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The slave master who owned her friend Pedro has returned to claim \"his property,\" and Cat and her friends, who include a group of adult abolitionists, won't have it. While trying to protect him, however, Cat gets herself into trouble and must go into hiding disguised as a boy at the aristocratic Westminster School, described in the glossary as \"supposedly a place of learning for young gentlemen; in truth, a den of floggers and bullies.\" As inThe Diamond of Drury Lane(Roaring Brook, 2008), Golding spins a tale that starts with a bang. However, the quick start slows down after Cat enters the boy's school and the plot turns its focus there, and readers may be left wondering what happened to Pedro.

Darby, a veteran Chicago newspaper columnist, here tells about such leading Windy City families as the Fields, Swifts, and Armours, and brings the story down to the present. Fast-paced but rather shallow, the book reads like series of extended columns. Good biography seeks to place a life or lives in the context of an era; good history explains change over time. But in this book we get just a parade of money-makers with little attention to the firms they operated, the business climate, or the social and political implications of generational transfers of great wealth.

The film Knowing, based on his original script, was released in 2009 and opened #1 at the box office. Receiving Four Stars from Roger Ebert, who branded it 'among the best science-fiction films I've seen', it went on to earn more than $180 million worldwide. He has also done uncredited work on films such as the remakes of The Day The Earth Stood Still and The Eye.Despite the often 'dark' nature of his novels and films, Pearson has been noted to have a 'sweet, disarming quality' by Entertainment Weekly-an accusation he has been unable to shake. When not writing he is usually thinking about writing, or touting the wonders of bacon in online conversations. He is addicted to diet soda and the sound of his children laughing.

Many of those positions are not suitable for persons with disabilities, injuries, or health conditions, as well as older adults. One of the great advantages of using Liberator Shapes is that they are stackable and can be used to support the lover's bodies in what otherwise would be either extremely uncomfortable positions, or simple impossible positions.Naturally, Liberator Shapes are also wildly popular with younger lovers, as well as older lovers who are in excellent physical health, because they facilitate experimentation with a much wider range of sexual positions than would be possible without Liberator Shapes.", "related": ["B009DNTP7E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He turned to writing when his first novel, The Take, was picked up by a publisher in 2009. His next book, Setup On Front Street, was the first of a series of Key West Nocturnes, standalone noir novels. These books will lift the veil on Key West and reveal it as a true noir city, on a par with Los Angeles, New Orleans, or Miami. The Ghosts Of Havana is the second book in that set. The third, Man-Slaughter, is now available, and the fourth, The Guns Of Miami, will be coming in 2013. Mike has also introduced the Jack Barnett/Las Vegas series, about a reluctant ex-private investigator living in Sin City, USA. The first entry in that series, a novelette called Temptation Town, is now available. The second installment, Hard Cash, also a novelette, is currently available, as is the third entry, a full novel called The Downtown Deal. Mike also has a collection of short stories, Bloodstains On The Wall. In addition, his stories have been published in A Twist Of Noir, Mysterical e, Powder Burn Flash, Slow Trains, and The Wizards Of Words 2009 Anthology. In addition, Mike has an experimental rockabilly novel called Cadillac's Comin', a hard tale of a one-hit wonder who recorded for Sun Records in the chaotic early days of rock & roll. In December, 2010, Mike moved back to Key West, where he enjoys year-round island living with his wife Yleana, whom he married on a warm December night in 2012 on the rooftop of an apartment building in Havana, Cuba.", "related": ["B00D9EHDLI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His beautiful, willful, capricious 24-year-old wife, Sophie, is failing to conceive a child. Fully as willful and self-absorbed as Sophie, the middle-aged cop is drinking prodigiously, buying his wife expensive gifts he can’t afford, flying into violent rages, and having Sophie followed. Two bizarre and savage murders, connected only by calendar pages that note the day of each murder, and Sophie’s angry flight to Berlin threaten to send Mock off an emotional cliff. Death in Breslau (2012) showcased the city as a roiling kettle of wealth, privilege, poverty, crime, scholarship, and depravity. This time, Krajewski focuses brilliantly on Mock’s psychological dissolution, but he also continues to offer fascinating glimpses of the city during a brief period of relative economic stability and sociocultural foment. Eating vast quantities of heavy food preoccupies most of the characters. Spiritualism is represented by a self-described Russian nobleman who lectures on the end of the world and a new messiah, born to a “Babylonian whore.” Cocaine use is widespread. Fraternal organizations and lodges figure in the tale. Marlene Dietrich is the toast of Berlin, and Breslau has its own Josephine Baker imitator, who performs sans clothes, in black paint.

She still has only one friend and yearns to get out of her small Australian town. Over the summer, though, a new boy who seems to like her, an internship at a local paper, and changes within her unique family shake things up. Condon’s quiet, spare novel avoids many common pitfalls. It never veers into excessively flowery language (though the Aussie slang may sometimes throw readers), too many plotlines, or overwrought drama. The book’s tension comes from Tiff’s internal struggles with her low self-esteem and her worries about her job and her surrogate grandfather. Tiff’s believable insecurities hooks the reader from the first page, and the everyday problems of her life, so uniquely Australian yet so universally young adult, keeps one turning pages, though to a slightly predictable ending.

I admit the early creative stories featured me riding the range with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and saving the West. What a disappointment to learn that Roy was exclusively committed to Dale! Eventually, my best friend from across the street and I decided to become better detectives than Nancy Drew. We drove our parents and neighbors crazy sticking our pert little noses where they didn't belong. About that time I started writing down my adventures, but mostly I was a reader. Not until I read Nora Roberts' early novels did I decide to create my own romance manuscripts. My road to publishing was a lot slower than Nora's was. No surprise there! I still read Nora's books—as well as those of countless other authors—but now I write full time. Unless life interferes, that is.  My Hero and I live one a small acreage in the ranching and horse country of North Central Texas. Finally, my childhood dream has come true and I’m in the midst of cowboys. Our two daughters are grown and in their own homes not far away.  Living with Hero and me now are Webster, our sweet black Shih Tzu, and our two shorthaired cats: Sebastian, a large black and white tuxedo who thinks he's our watchcat; and Bailey Erin, a shy apricot tabby who mostly stays in my office. When I'm not writing, I love spending time with family, reading, traveling with Hero, browsing antique malls and estate sales, and digging into family history and genealogy. Writing about strong heroes and heroines who overcome amazing obstacles to forge a meaningful life together is my passion.  I love to hear from readers at caroline @ carolineclemmons (dot) com.

Dahl of Homicide, who is on a murder-arson case. The owner of \"Crazy Dave's\" appliance store, Dave Wagner, insists he had borrowed thousands he couldn't pay back to a loan shark, Vigotti, who now demands the fire-insurance money. When Vigotti is \"eliminated\" as a suspect by local capos, Brichter forms a close relationship with elderly arson-expert Captain Isaac (Zak) Kader, and their investigation confirms Crazy Dave's alibi. Tireless deduction produces evidence that clinches the case but creates more victims as a consequence. Threats to Kori, hints of Lt.

His academic career is in art and art history and he has taught art history at a variety of colleges, including his alma mater, the University of Arkansas. His first novel was published by Random House in 1965, and since then he has published twelve other novels, most of them set in the Ozark hamlet of his own creation, Stay More, based loosely upon Drakes Creek. He has also written books about artists. He won the Robert Penn Warren Award in 2003, the Porter Prize in 1987, the Heasley Prize at Lyon College in 1998, was inducted into the Arkansas Writers' Hall of Fame in 1999 and that same year won the Arkansas Fiction Award of the Arkansas Library Association.

My views may run toward the conservative, but my passion leans toward the humorous. I have always believed my life is proof that God has a sense of humor. An avid reader since my teens, I began writing after quitting my job to stay home with my girls and occasionally needed to focus on something other than diapers and Dr Seuss. What started as an inexpensive hobby quickly became an obsession. Eventually I joined a local writer's club and enrolled in writing classes at a Christian university. Once the kids were older I ventured back into the work force and do my best to balance the necessity of a full time job with my obsessive hobby.

Reigning supreme over this juggernaut is The Harrell Family, a clan of criminal royalty that oversees the city's narcotics flow with the efficiency of a billion dollar corporation. Seated at the head of the table is Ezra Harrell, the Family's patriarch and mastermind behind The Syndicate. Under the guiding hand of the respected and feared cartel boss, The Syndicate has corrupted some of the city's most influential hierarchy and has completely reshaped the city's criminal landscape; making The Syndicate the most untouchable criminal organization Washington DC has ever seen...  In the Harrell Family, nothing is more important than blood. Anything threatening their tightly knit unit is dealt with in a ferocious manner, absent of all hesitation or mercy. Their family creed of \"Nothing Before Family\" is more than just a mere catchphrase or punchline. For the Harrells, those three words represent an unwavering, unforgiving way of life lived on a high and fueled by closed-fisted brutality... In the shadows, a ruthless killer is stalking the Harrells; slowly and methodically hunting his way to the top of their family. As the clock ticks, Ezra Harrell must do everything in his extensive power to escape his way of life and move his family to a safe haven before time runs out. Ezra fears for his family's safety, but his chief concern is his son, Santea, the heir apparent to The Syndicate throne. Ezra refuses to allow his only child to follow in his footsteps down a bloody path he wished he'd never walked himself... BAD INTENTIONS is book one of the CITY HIGH series, a multiple novel saga chronicling the rise, fall and redemption of the Harrell Family, Washington DC's First Family of Crime.

He was a great man and a good friend. It is easier to succeed if you have respect and it is given only to those who deserve it. In the past it was only for the wealthy and has never been published before. It is an honorable code and is in my book, \"Success Principals from the Commander of the Legions of Rome\". A Japanese Judo Master confronted me in Hawaii and was shocked when he found out that I knew the Honorable code. Our cook rebuilt an old car that took him over a year and tried to start it without a clutch. We towed it to the top of a hill on the Station as all of the family dependents  and friends watched. We pushed it with our truck and suddenly it took off with a roar down the hill with the cook inside. The cook jumped out as it flew over the cliff and plunged deep into the Ocean. We went shark hunting in Hawaii and a young teen ager dove into the water with the sharks, he came within inches of losing his life. When the sharks attack it is from under the water, not along the surface. Another time our Coast Guard crew had target practice from the shore line on large oil drums, it's all in the book. We fired everything at them and were a complete failure as they all floated away out to Sea.We are supposed to prevent things like that. Most of my book sales are to Coast Guard and Navy veterans with an honorable discharge. This is a rare look behind the scenes of the bases, ships, and men of the United States Coast Guard, this is what happened. God bless them all.", "related": ["B00540GK78"], "rank": 1236660, "title": "True Stories of the U.S. Coast Guard eBook", "author": "Ray Ives", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a lover of medical history COTTER was written to portray post-Civil War medicine’s rapid advances. I believe literature should be educational, fun, serious, full of feelings and always with a touch of fantasy as THE HELIOS RAIN shows.

Ripercorre i viaggi in Africa, in Egitto, in Iran, poi di nuovo in Africa, rievocando sotto tutt’altra luce e con mano leggera le vicende storiche che ve lo hanno portato. Ci rivela le difficoltà incontrate di fronte alla vastità della materia da dominare, interpretare e giudicare. E, di fronte a queste difficoltà, il suo punto di riferimento, il suo livre de chevet, il testo da leggere e rileggere è sempre stato Erodoto. La lettura di Erodoto non di rado lo appassionava più del lavoro da svolgere. Erodoto, come Shakespeare, ha visto il microcosmo delle passioni umane e il macrocosmo delle vicende storiche. Da un lato ci ha narrato come la Grecia abbia ritardato di secoli l’avanzare dell’Asia in Europa e, dall’altro, ha rappresentato la brama di potere, la crudeltà, la cecità di piccoli e grandi satrapi. Erodoto fa capolino dalle storie di Kapuściński, compare e scompare, viene chiamato a descrivere i meccanismi dell’animo umano, le sue grandezze, i suoi errori. Non siamo tuttavia di fronte a uno studio accademico o all’omaggio sentimentale dedicato a un autore molto amato. L’idea guida di Kapuściński è che Erodoto è stato non tanto uno storico, quanto il primo vero reporter della storia: il suo bisogno di viaggiare, di toccare con mano, di raccogliere dati, paragonarli ed esporli, con tutte le necessarie riserve che è giusto nutrire riguardo alle storie riferite da altri, fa di Erodoto un giornalista a pieno titolo. Pur rimaneggiando la materia storico-politico-culturale che gli è sempre stata congeniale, Kapuściński riesce a darci un’opera nuova: un libro che procede a zig zag, che descrive le cose con distacco, senza ombra di pedanteri...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has recently finished a book exploring less well known haunted locations based on personal experiences and is developing at least one of his short stories into a full length fictional novel.Greg's recent Witch Hunter series is gathering pace and there is around 4 novelettes planned for the series, before the final novel to conclude the series. At that point it is possible the series will be continued or a planned prequel series will be launched.As a keen explorer of historical buildings and sites, Greg has recorded numerous tales of hauntings and had several as yet unexplained experiences himself. Some of these have been complied into the book 'Scotland's Hidden Hauntings', a collection of less well known haunted locations in Scotland. He has recently completed a second book 'Scotland's Haunted and Mysterious Places' and is currently working on a third real ghost story book.For more details, to view some photographs taken during visits to haunted locations and to read Greg's blog, please visit his website at:gstewarthorror.weebly.com/index.html", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Growing up she loved to write. She found out writing was her get away from the realities of her life. She was raised by her grandmother who taught her how to be strong. Without the knowledge and prayers of her grandmother, she would have never made it. Living life in Brothels learning how to hustle from her uncles gave her the wisdom to survive in the streets. The one thing she knew was how to hustle. Deciding to get out the business of pimps and prostitutes she traveled looking for love. True love is what she wanted, but never found. The only person she ever felt who loved her was her grandmother. Not receiving the love she wanted from her parents she turned to the streets and ended up gang banging, selling drugs, doing drugs, selling her soul and living a life of corruption. In and out of relationships, trying to find love, Tivona knew there was a better life out there for her.  Livin the Fast Life was not something she wanted to do for the rest of her life; she knew she had to slow down and find out what her calling was. Writing and keeping journals were her passion. Through her trials and tribulations she needed something to give her an out. She needed to be able to express herself without hurting the one's she loved. No matter what was going on in her life, her journals would be destroyed. Now, she realizes the words on the paper have a powerful meaning. Still afraid of sharing her story, she continued writing in her journal.In 2003, Tivona moved to Texas; hoping to make a better life for herself. Getting extremely sick and the doctors are not sure what was wrong with her; Tivona became unable to work. Not knowing what she was going to do, she knew hustling was always something she would have to fall back on.  Now, she wants to hustle the right way. Writing has always been her passion, and she knew it was time for her to tell her story. In 2010, she published her first novel. Livin' the Fast Life. Not sure where to begin, she took her book on the road, selling it out the trunk of her car.  While, on the road, she got sicker. Blacking out, Tivona was rushed to the hospital. Finding out she has Lupus.  Her courage, strength, and wisdom, would not allow her to stop living her dreams.  She continues to pursue her dreams and encourages others to do the same.

He showed her much of the great vision when she was nine years old. He taught her how to survive the difficult black road and how to be happy from within. Eliza had a near-death experience in 2002 due to a serious road accident. She believes she died for three minutes and was sent back to do the divine work she had come to do. For the past eleven years, Black Elk has been guiding Eliza in fulfilling this divine life's purpose. The Two Roads Trilogy is a story based on Eliza's experiences in the spirit world, her experiences with Black Elk and other spirits, and her many past-life memories. She lives in Ireland with her husband and sons.

That isn't to say there is none whatsoever, but romance is not the focal point in any of the books. Bear this in mind when considering the purchase of this and future books in this series.The Blood of Ages series follows Catrina Malinka, a fledgling vampire who accidentally inherits the powers of a god, and the war against vampires and the Archway Corporation, a company which has made a tidy profit on turning vampire hunting into a business.Books in the \"Blood of Ages\" Series:The main series is still in progress, and includes the following titles:- Blood of Ages 1: The Genesis- Blood of Ages 2: Divided They Fall (Due for Release 2014)- Blood of Ages 3: Blood of Ages (Due for Release 2015)The main series has a linear storyline and these three need to be read in order. This storyline will be complete after the third book, but each book also has a logical and satisfying conclusion.Related works include:- From The Ashes - A novel, best read any time after \"The Genesis\"- In The Blood - A novel, best read any time after \"Divided They Fall\" (Release Date TBA)- A Demon's Share - A short story, best read any time after \"The Genesis\" (Release Date TBA)- Coming Up Roses - A novelette, best read any time after \"The Genesis\" (Release Date TBA)The companion stories can be read independently of the main trilogy, but they are recommended to be read in-line with the series itself. It is marked in each book where on the reading list the companion novels should come.Will there be more books?While the main storyline ends with Blood of Ages, the ending is such to make future books possible. In addition, there are many other characters in the Blood of Ages universe whose stories I'd like to tell.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are no\ncliff-hanger endings, and the novels can be enjoyed in isolation from\neach other.) After writing two novels about psychopaths,\nI was ready for a \"smaller\" story, but wasn't sure how to do that and maintain\nthe tension. After all, Mic Boyd and Bobby Lee Paget were intensely evil. If I\ntried to write about another serial killer, I knew I would grow stale.As for the series, I knew what I wanted to do. I\nwould develop the character of the Carter's daughter, Mirabelle, and I would\nincorporate Raven, Shane, and Doc Hoag into the Carter's extended family. The\nrelationship with Sheriff Shug Shively, and Richard's continuing rise in\nimportance as a deputy was well in hand, that is to say, I had conceptualized\nit. I also intended to introduce a new character, one who would play an\nincreasing role in the stories. I envisioned someone who could be both a\nsounding board for Richard and someone who could think, say, and do things that\nRichard couldn't. So I saw the way forward.However, back to the problem: how was I to write a\n\"smaller\" story, without disappointing the reader who would buy the\nbook expecting to find the same level of peril and tension? I decided to write\nmore of a mystery this time. It also occurred to me that many\nmystery/detective/police procedurals were too linear in plot development,\nwhereas in real-life investigators spend\na great deal of time judging what is part of the crime(s) and what is not. Furthermore, deputies seldom are able to concentrate on one crime to the exclusion of\nothers.Secret Song involves an old (solved) case. The\nrecent return of an ex-con occurs almost simultaneously with the recovery of\nthe body of his victim. One can only imagine the passions ignited by such a\ncoincidence in a small community.Writing out a bare outline of the plot, I began to\nimagine how my regular characters and others within the community would react. I\nhad to continue the overriding theme throughout the series: obsession. This\nstory began small, but didn't stay that way. At the risk of sounding like a latter-day\nWilliam Blake, my characters began telling me how they would react and what\nthey would say. They carried me along, and I enjoyed the ride. I hope the\nreader will also.The tag line for this story might be:\n\"Unspeakable evil does not require evil intent.\"", "related": ["B00DI4UN4I"], "rank": 262577, "title": "Secret Song (The Richard Carter Novels Book 4)", "author": "AR Simmons", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This particular volume is targeted at children ages 5 to 7 and will teach children the body parts of honeybees, how honeybees use each of these body parts, and how each classification of honeybee differs in their body parts. Did you know that only certain honeybees have stingers? Did you know that honeybees have two stomachs? These are just a few of the interesting facts to be found in the pages of this book. Kids are sure to enjoy learning these interesting details as well as more about the ins and outs of the honeybee in this delightful book. Jeanette Vuuren's book, Honeybees's Body Parts, would be a welcome addition to elementary science classrooms.  Vuuren's series will help children learn the importance of these small creatures. The book is simple enough for young readers, but varied enough for science classrooms. Teachers will find a wealth of information to be used in their curriculum, including diagrams, vocabulary lists, and outside references. However, it is the joyful illustrations by Sudipta Dasgupta that are sure to draw young readers to this book. Each page is adorned with bright color and cheerful images that are sure to delight readers even as they are being informed. The pictures are sharp and crisp and provide wonderful insight and clarity into the information being taught. I recommend Honeybee's Body Parts, and I look forward to reading more in this series by Jeanette Vuuren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The result is that my readers and I are unraveling the story together.  It is like 'interactive reading'.When we were young we were taught that reading is fundamental. As adults I believe reading should be fun.  I've tried to keep the pace brisk, the plot developing with a twist here and there, and the characters.....well, being characters. When you finish and put down one of my books I hope you will have had your funny-bone tickled, your heart tugged upon and feel like you've made some new fictional friends.Enjoy my stories...and thanks for your help along the way!", "related": ["B008NTG6JY"], "rank": 3615309, "title": "Animal Stories (Borelli & O'Toole Series)", "author": "P.

Jennings' prose is taut, pithy, his imagery something only a combatant in one of these wars could write (Jennings is an Iraq War veteran), and he treats, as the collection title implies, not the smoke, noise, and fog of war, but the emotional toll exacted on these combatants.In the title story, my favorite, we read of a group of soldiers dumped from an airplane, onto a desert and inside razor wire to wait for enemy attacks. These never come, but a camel roams too close and tangles itself in the razor wire. The manner in which the soldiers react to this is the most stark portrayal I can imagine of the moral degradation that accompanies war. Metaphorically, I think that the enemy Jennings writes of here is the one in these combatants' hearts and souls after so many months and years of such experience.Kudos to Iron Horse for having the nerve to publish this, and I can only hope that Jennings can continue to grow beyond these stark experiences as a writer.My rating: 17 of 20 starsBob Mustin bobmust.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/the-human-toll/", "related": [], "rank": 1258616, "title": "Waiting for the Enemy (Kindle Single)", "author": "Brandon Davis Jennings", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
