The spacious, high-ceilinged room had been turned into an activity center, and as director of a summer program for disadvantaged hearing-impaired children, Marian was learning the hard way that the mountain estate with its imposing three-storied mansion had never been meant for a dozen eight-to twelve-year-old youngsters.The property belonged to Alva Wentworth, a widow in her late seventies who was in a local nursing home. Located near one of the state's popular tourist areas in southern Colorado the estate was worth a fortune and ripe for development. Countless investors had tried to persuade the wealthy widow to sell the estate but she had stubbornly held on to it. Her only heir had been a grandson, Stanley, whom she'd disinherited when she'd discovered a series of illegal maneuvers of his to get his hands on her money before she died. Everyone was amazed when she agreed to let the Colorado Foundation for Disadvantaged Children use the mansion and grounds for a children's summer program.Marian was determined that everything would go smoothly under her leadership. She'd been assistant director at a private school for the hearing impaired when she heard about the summer program and quickly applied for the position. She was delighted and slightly surprised when she was offered the job even though she was the youngest applicant, only thirty years old and still working on a doctorate in social services. She was determined that all would go smoothly, because this experience would be a professional stepping stone to the position of director at one of Colorado's larger institutions.Her first challenge had been to evaluate recommended children for the program. After considerable debate with teachers and social workers, she had chosen six boys and six girls of various ages and problems. She'd met with some negative reaction when she'd chosen Scotty Tanner, an eleven-year-old who had both hearing and emotional problems. Even his foster parents had warned her that the boy didn't do well in groups.As Marian entered the activity room, she looked around for Scotty but didn't see the slender boy with unruly blond hair and snapping blue eyes. He usually dominated the Ping-Pong table, furiously venting his anger upon the small ball. Already Marian had learned that Scotty was constantly warring against the acceptance of his deafness and striking out at anything and everybody. He seemed intent upon isolating himself beyond what a hearing loss would create.Uneasiness began to stir as she walked over to Rob Harman, a middle-aged physical-education teacher who had raised a deaf son and spent his summers working with the handicapped. He was easygoing and patient but at the same time firm enough to maintain control.Marian had a staff of five people, counting herself, and was pleased they'd developed a summer curriculum that was both instructive and recreational.\"I don't see Scotty in the room, Rob. Do you know where he is?\"\"He was here right after lunch but complained his stomach hurt. He asked to go back upstairs to his bunk but I sent him to the nurse. I decided Bertha could tell whether he was goldbricking or not.\" Rob sighed. \"He's not the most sociable kid on the block.\"Marian nodded in agreement. \"A real loner, for sure.\" The only time the boy seemed visible was when there was trouble of some kind, but she was willing to give Scotty some leeway. He'd been running the streets most of his life. No father in the picture and a mother strung out on drugs most of the time. Scotty might have ended up serving time in a juvenile facility if a homemade bomb hadn't plunged him into deafness and made him a ward of the court.\"Maybe after a few weeks in the program we'll see a change for the better,\" Marian told Rob. She was encouraged because she'd seen one good sign already in his behavior. For some inexplicable reason, the tough, streetwise Scotty had appointed himself protector of Mindy Simpson, a small, shy eight-year-old girl who had been deaf since birth.Scotty had met her in class for the hearing impaired which he'd been required to attend when he was turned over to the court. It was because of the dark-haired, curly-headed Mindy that Scotty had mastered any sign language at all. Unfortunately, he seemed only willing to try signing in order to communicate with the shy little girl. Most of the time he got along as best he could with lip-reading, defying all orders to practice communicating with any of the other students.\"I'll check with the nurse,\" Marian told Rob and then walked across the room to a table where several girls were involved in an activity of following directions. They were making Indian god's eyes out of yarn and sticks. Because a field trip was planned to the nearby Mesa Verde Indian ruins, the teachers had decided to incorporate some of the activities, stories and art around an Indian theme.Nancy Collins, a chubby, round-faced teacher in her early forties, was busily moving around the table, smiling, nodding and signing her approval. Marian had worked with Nancy before and was delighted when the outgoing, good-natured teacher had applied for the summer program. Together they had developed a program of activities to help hearing-impaired children develop language, speech and listening skills.Marian stopped at Mindy's chair and lightly touched the little girl on the shoulder to get her attention. As she looked up, her smiling eyes were a sparkling blue and full of life.\"I'm looking for Scotty,\" Marian signed. \"Do you know where he is?\"She shook her head and her fingers flitted like butterflies as she responded, \"I haven't seen him since lunch. Is he in trouble again?\"I hope not. Marian sighed silently as she nodded approval of the rather lopsided god's eye that Mindy held up for her approval.Even though a building uneasiness urged Marian to find Scotty as soon as possible, she took time to look at all the girls' handiwork. Marian knew these children wanted so much to connect with other people that sometimes they were like puppies willing to do anything for a pat on the head.\"We're going to make one to hang in your office,\" Nancy told her with a grin. \"It'll keep all the problems away from your door.\"\"What a lovely idea. The sooner the better.\"\"What's happening?\"\"I feel as if I'm holding on to a dozen horses going in all directions,\" Marian admitted. \"New-job jitters, I guess.\"\"Relax, everything's under control,\" Nancy assured her with her usual optimistic grin.Marian gave her a grateful smile as she left the room and headed down the hall to a small sitting room that had been changed into a nursing station and dispensary.Bertha Higgins was a large, motherly-looking woman in her fifties who was not only a registered nurse but also a certified teacher, trained in speech, auditory development, sign language and lip-reading. Marian had hired her because she was qualified to take turns relieving Nancy and Rob with the students so the two teachers might have some free time. When Bertha wasn't tending to medical needs or handling a class, she took it upon herself to instruct individual students about specific health habits they were ignoring.Marian knew Bertha had playfully threatened to wash Scotty's ears and neck for him. Much to every-one's surprise the boy had given her a big grin as if he wasn't used to anyone paying that much attention to him.Maybe he was just faking the stomachache so he could get Bertha's attention again, Marian thought as she politely knocked on the door.\"Come in.\"The nurse had her back to the door, putting some medical supplies in a cabinet. When she turned around, she gave Marian a cheery smile as she said, \"What can I do you for?\"\"I'm looking for Scotty.\"\"I haven't seen him. Was he supposed to check in with me?\"\"Well, Rob excused him and told him to see you because Scotty said he had a stomachache.\"Bertha chuckled. \"The oldest ploy in the world. Better than a headache. I bet he knows every trick in the book, that one. He's probably stretched out on his bunk waiting for dinnertime. I bet the kid's been starved a lot of his life. He'll put on a pound or two while he's here.\"\"Well, if he's hiding out, I just might find a job or two that will help his appetite.\" As she turned to leave, she said, \"If he shows up, hold on to him.\"\"Will do.\"Heading down the hall, Marian intended to go up to the second floor where the boys had assigned beds, but another youngster, Peter, came bounding down the center staircase just as she reached it.Putting out her hand, she stopped him. Knowing the ten-year-old was a good lip-reader, she looked straight at him and carefully mouthed her words, slowly and evenly. \"Peter, did you see Scotty upstairs?\"He shook his head. \"Nobody up there. I went to get this,\" he told her in a flat but understandable tone as he held out a small electronic game. \"You want to play?\"\"Not now, Peter. Maybe later,\" she answered.He nodded to show he understood and then bounded down the hall toward the activity room.Marian decided to check the kitchen, since Scotty had already been caught stealing food between meals. The cook, Elsie Mullens, had threatened him with a week's dish-washing detail if he did it again and Marian had approved the promised punishment.She liked the hefty, gray-haired cook who had been hired to prepare the meals. Once, Marian had heard Elsie on the phone arguing with a Denver dietician about the menus they had sent her to prepare. Elsie had spent most of her life cooking for ranchers and was used to preparing meals for hardworking men with healthy appetites and not finicky youngsters.\"Yeah, he was here,\" Elsie replied when Marian asked her if she'd seen Scotty. \"Hanging around, he was, waiting for me to turn my back. He's got sticky fingers, that one. Lordy, he's snitched more than one pastry right out from under my nose.\" As she talked she vigorously patted flour on a bread board and wheeled a rolling pin over fresh dough. \"I shooed him out of here fast like.\"\"Do you k...", "related": [], "rank": 2284038, "title": "Silent Witness", "author": "Leona Karr", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A must for researchers in orthogonal polynomials or in approximation theory, or in any other field where orthogonal polynomials play an essential role.\" (Adhemar Bultheel, Belgian Mathematical Society, Vol. 10 (2), 2003)\"It is a magnum opus that brings together the substantial research over 18 years on this topic by Levin and Lubinsky, two leaders in the field. With its attention to new results … the work is presented more in the form of a very substantial research paper rather than a book. It will undoubtedly be of considerable use to researchers in this area … . There is no doubt that this book is a substantial contribution to the literature on orthogonal polynomials … .\" (Walter R. Bloom, The Australian Mathematical Society Gazette, Vol. 30 (4), 2003)\"This monograph provides a systematic treatment of the theory and applications of orthogonal polynomials with exponential weights. … In conclusion, this monograph will be a significant addition to the existing monographs on Orthogonal Polynomials and related areas. It will be useful for researchers working in the fields of mathematical, physical, statistical and engineering sciences.\" (R. K. Saxena, Journal of the Indian Academy of Mathematics, Vol. 24 (2), 2002)\"The authors of this monograph have greatly contributed to the present state of the art of this subject, and in this book present a comprehensive account of it. Parallel to this, they update the results either in strength or in generality, and so most of them appear for the first time in the form given here.\" (G. López Lagomasimo, Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society, Vol. 35, 2003)\"It … looks like a set of research papers, with very recent results and detailed proofs, using the latest available tools and techniques … . This book is a must for approximators, in particularly those interested in weighted polynomial approximation or orthogonal polynomials.

As with Donald Hall's Without or Ted Hughes's The Birthday Letters, the poems can vary widely in quality, and are best read as if constantly moving between verse memoir and poetry, with real people standing behind the poems' personae. And that is particularly apt here, as many of the poems knowingly engage Dukes's profession-\"You give me up/ You go away/ You walk on a stage/ and are re-made.\" Coming almost exclusively in quatrains, tercets and distichs, these 43 short lyrics are suffused with remembrances of daily married life, of \"[h]ow we ate together, slept together, sank/ into the distraction of distraction. Twenty years.\" Longing and grief produce concentrated moments of terse, wry observations on grief (\"Death was a critic, like me./ Death could never be the actor-\"; \"everyone, Catullus,// I mean everyone, tells her to shut the fuck up\") and grasped-for metaphor: \"the shadow of the parachute of/ my desire, this rip-cord of your photo-/ blink.\" The best poems capture the darkly ambiguous ruminations of a partner left behind, with an imagination has been turned upside down. In \"A Private Matter\" the speaker flits through the characters her husband still embodies in video images, but can't quite insert herself: \"Serge cries, `Red Seneca!' Laura is alone/ in the space station, weeping. I am not weeping./ I am emptying my pockets of my own monologues.\" It is a process that, often enough, readers will find tensely drawn and heartbreaking.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael were, first and foremost, community organizers—as was Barack Obama, whose trajectory, according to the author, represents the culmination and redemption of his predecessors' efforts. Joseph examines two paths to black social justice—black power and the pulpit-driven civil rights movement—which popular history has traditionally pitted in opposition. Even if Carmichael's bracing criticism of American democracy or the Panthers' militancy seem miles away from King's pacifism, Joseph reveals how the two approaches fed off of each other, creating the kind of conflict and progress that would pave the way for the first African-American president, whose political roots are planted in activism. The author makes a persuasive and stimulating case for Obama's election as a vindication for black power, and his book is a vivid and welcome recasting of the history—and the myriad interpretations—of the movement.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He goes beyond the standard linguistics arguments to posit the existence of parallel mental structures governing other processes such as music and vision.

He has had over 50 books published. He has sold over four million books, and is in demand as a team-building, life-changing, and leadership speaker and consultant for his Who Dares Wins: The Green Beret Way concept, which he translated into Write It Forward: a holistic program teaching writers how to be authors. He is also the Co-Creator of Cool Gus Publishing, which does both eBooks and Print On Demand, so he has experience in both traditional and non-traditional publishing. His books have hit the NY Times, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal and numerous other bestseller lists. His book The Jefferson Allegiance, was released independently and reached #2 overall in sales on Nook. Bob Mayer grew up in the Bronx. After high school, he entered West Point where he learned about the history of our military and our country. During his four years at the Academy and later in the Infantry, Mayer questioned the idea of \"mission over men.\" When he volunteered and passed selection for the Special Forces as a Green Beret, he felt more at ease where the men were more important than the mission. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. In his historical fiction novels, Mayer blends actual events with fictional characters. He doesn't change history, but instead changes how history came into being. Mayer's military background, coupled with his deep desire to understand the past and how it affects our future, gives his writing a rich flavor not to be missed.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 19, "rating_average": 4.4211, "rating_total": 84.0}

Binod’s research brings him to Bihar, India, near the village where he was raised. This is also where his cousin, the larger-than-life Rabinder, is imprisoned after distributing pornography through his Internet café. While Binod struggles to begin writing the script, the past and present lives of other relatives become intertwined with his own, particularly those of his perceptive, dying father and Bua, Binod’s aunt and Rabinder’s mother, who breaks societal and political norms after her husband becomes mentally unstable. In the meantime, Rabinder concocts various get-rich-quick schemes and finally decides on filmmaking to pursue the commercial success he so desires. The shifts between rural communities and the urban sprawl of Delhi and Bombay heighten the contrasting perspectives in Kumar’s intelligent tale. --Leah Strauss", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So many people are going to connect with this book. To learn from Jeremy s journey and the places he s been is very encouraging. His story is AMAZING! It should be called The Gospel According to Formerly Chubby! --Mike Weaver, Lead Singer of Big Daddy Weave.I became overly impressed and a huge (HaHa, get it?) Jeremy Rochford fan when he told me about his 200lb weight loss journey. He shared everything from food addiction to the little things that continued to spiral him out of control. What blew me away most is that he didn't have any surgery. No liposuction, no lap-band, no excuses, he did it the old fashion way... he focused himself.  The Gospel According to Chubby will tell you about his journey, what made him do what he did, think the way he thought, and feel the way he felt. Whatever your issue, compulsion or hang-up is you will see yourself in the pages. My issue has never been food, but I can relate to where he has been and what he has gone through and I find encouragement for my own failings.  Jeremy does not sensationalize his story. But he doesn't candy coat it either. He will lay out everything about his physical, emotional, and social decay and will let you know that the biggest issue was his spiritual decay. He doesn't allow anyone to sit back and say, Oh, I have a thyroid issue, or I m just chubby. He calls it like he sees it. Not by pointing the finger saying, Look at you. He does it by raising his hand saying, Look at me. I have a problem. And I found the answer. --Justin Lookadoo, International Speaker, Best Selling Author of Dateable: are you? are they?As someone who mostly reads fiction, I was a bit hesitant when I picked up this book. I was worried that it wouldn't hold my attention, but it had me chuckling the whole way though. It takes a lot of guts (or should I say Moobs) to share an inter-monologue with the world. I have a loved one in my life who has struggled with obesity and it can be heart breaking. After reading Jeremy s book I now know how much I didn't know! It has forever changed the way I will interact with others. My favorite part is the message. If you struggle with any addiction in your life, not just food, this book will speak to you! Thank you Jeremy for the time and effort you put into this story. It was hilarious, smart and touching.

(Interactive Press, 2004), is a harsh, realistic and compassionate depiction of life on the streets for Australian kids.

Levy has been a winner of the Australian Human Rights Award for Journalism - for a multiple series of stories on child sex abuse, domestic violence and homelessness; a winner of the Anning Barton Memorial Award for Outstanding Journalism (Central Queensland) for a series of stories on child sex abuse (incest-rape), and a Walkley Awards Queensland State finalist for his series on homelessness.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You can infer a good deal about folks who see Castro as a cartoonish supervillain and about people who just can't think of a single critical thing to say about his regime. Konno falls into the latter camp, as his discussion of Che is essentially propaganda. Che's much romanticized youth as a motorcycle-driving vagabond is set as the catalyst for a profound intellectual awakening. Everything Che does, from abandoning a wife and child to leading bloody campaigns throughout Latin America and the Congo, is for the sake of justice. Konno has no time for piddling discussions of Che's penchant for summary executions, his questionable skill at guerrilla warfare, or his incompetence as a national economic manager. Similarly, the book takes for granted communism's rightness. In spite of this, it's a powerfully drawn comic, and the writing is at its most effective in its scathing critique of American cold war foreign policy. Che's adventures, as they are captured here, make for exciting fiction. Look elsewhere for a more balanced story. (Oct.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

A ghost story way up on the line with my personal favorite Stephen King books: Cujo and the Pet Sematary.\" - Natalie Valentina, Goodreads\"I found myself comparing him to Stephen King, mainly because I have a hard time getting into his books, but once I do I am hooked. And it was this way with Dogs of War. I felt there was a lot of detail in the house that wasn't necessary, honestly I didn't need to know the colors of the sheet and bedding, but the tale of Molly and the ghosts that haunted her was riveting. I felt the horror that Gary felt when he allowed Molly out on the second ghostly visit and he witnessed her interaction with them. I was horrified when he made a ghastly discovery in the basement and understood Molly's and the ghosts need for vengeance.

From this experience, he wrote a first novel - ''Oeuvre à la Financière'' or ''A Financial Opus'', published in French by Editions Thélès in 2007. This thriller set in modern-day France received glowing reviews in Les Echos, sister paper of the Financial Times. Given how much he enjoyed writing, Charles decided to continue.

He is also a member of the Institute of Industrial Engineers and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers.Murry Parkis the founder of MRP ONE, a manufacturing consulting company located in Mount Vernon, Washington. As a 26-year veteran of manufacturing, Murry’s service has spanned roles from entry-level engineer to vice president and general manager to senior Lean consultant. His professional experience includes working with companies from various industries ranging from electronics to metals and aerospace to seafood and from small privately owned companies to larger publicly traded corporations across North America.Internationally, he has observed and analyzed production processes in Argentina, Belgium, Italy, Japan, and Canada. Murry’s professional experience began in 1983 when volume batch processing was still considered vogue in American manufacturing. However, struggling with the realities of such an approach, he quickly recognized the merits of such new concepts as 5S, setup reduction, one-piece flow, and kanban, as he came to understand and apply them. Seeing immediate and dramatic improvements from every implementation, Murry became a lifelong student—and teacher—in the pursuit of sharing these concepts and methods with others. He has led countless improvement activities and has watched as serious value-adding enterprises embraced a culture of continuous improvement based on employee participation, thereby also enjoying the benefits that followed.", "related": ["B005RTXFTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the presence of South Indian Yogis, New Mexican Santeros, Afro-Cuban Orishas, Edgar Allen Poe, The Beatles and La Llorona, the author details moments in the lives of Cubans, Nuevo Mexicanos and Anglo-Americans.The stories are sometimes comical and often tragic but always engaging. In each one, Dovalpage reminds us that any choice we make, from deciding to leave the country, to walking around the block to engaging in a conversation with a total stranger, could become momentous. In the blink of an eye, the insignificant turns historic.Although each story is self contained and can be read independently, it is when they are read together that they are most affective, unsettling, comic and heartfelt. Characters, storylines, and motifs reappear from one tale to the next, informing and enriching each other. While every story is distinct, these protagonists, who are from varied cultural and economic backgrounds, share common struggles as they stumble in search for a way to escape or a place to land, to live, to be who they are. There are no heroes in these stories but they are not villains either, much like in everyday life. Oddly, that is what is most comforting, for lack of a better word, aboutThe Astral Plane: Stories of Cuba, the Southwest and Beyond, at least for this reader. Dovalpage's characters exude an unapologetic normalcy in their flaws that even toothless false prophets, calculating serial killers, conniving prostitutes, and scheming mothers-in-law become endearing in the end.(Carolina CaballeroLatinoLA, February 2, 2012)The stories are thoroughly Cuban, original, delightful, and unexpected. In this cohesive collection, Ms. Dovalpage’s prodigious talent takes us on a dazzling journey of high drama, whimsical imagery, nail-biting suspense, and laugh-out-loud hilarity. Along the way she lays bare the reality of life in Cuba and totally debunks the myths of the Castro Revolution.One favorite passage includes a lyrical, evocative description of El Malecón that made me weep with longing for the sights, sounds, and smells of that drive; a paragraph later I erupted in laughter at a character’s offhand comment. This savory collection is certain to become a favorite read, highly recommended.(February 4, 2012)Teresa Dovalpage’s latest collection of short storiesThe Astral Planefeatures a set of stories where the characters have a tenuous connection to each other. The stories showcase how the Cuban Hispanic diaspora spread with contacts with former relatives, escapees via the rafts, and with contacts with visitors and universities that can travel to Cuba with ease. Thus, stories take place partly in Cuba, in Miami, and in Albuquerque.Throughout the tales, the change brought about by Fidel Castro seep out in details about the way people live, the food they eat, the political pressures to conform, the desire for US Cash and lifestyle and the turn to the Santeria religion.Teresa Dovalpage constructs her stories with a heavy dose of metaphor that is artfully shared by taking a distant point of view and by carefully constructing her plots. The plots unfold in a chatty fashion where you learn about the people that surround a character, their family, their friends, and their style of life.Readers will enjoy the unusual mix of character types, settings, and plots that can introduce them to a politically strong minority population in the United States. They make a potent case for democracy and capitalism.(Sheri Fresonke HarperThe Compulsive Reader, March 2012)The Astral Planeis the latest book by Cuban author Teresa Dovalpage. Ziva Sahl describes the stories in Dovalpage's collection as, 'thoroughly Cuban, original, delightful, and unexpected.'I had the chance to read the book and can only say thatThe Astral Planeis another fine accomplishment by one of our most talented Latina writers these days.(Mayra CalvaniThe Examiner, May 22, 2012)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It possesses many of the virtues of the traditional English novel--pride of place, respect for a winsome underclass and an overriding fascination with the language and wiles of the ruling elite--and at the same time radically subverts those virtues. Thorpe's ambitions are broad, and paradoxically so, since he has subjected himself to the narrow constraints of period style. No single family or dominant theme threads through the novel's 12 chapters; they are unified only in their recounting of events--or more accurately, their extended snatches of language--grounded in rural Ulverton, a fictional town in Thomas Hardy's Wessex. The opening scene depicts one of Cromwell's soldiers staggering home; the closer is a shooting script for a film about the failed purchase of land in Ulverton in 1988. In between we are treated to letters from a barely literate mother to her imprisoned son (said to date from 1775), a story, told in an alehouse, about a road accident (1803), an arch Victorian discussion of a collection of photographs, and more. Thorpe's attempt to portray a changing England solely through changing literary conventions is more than admirable. However, it is sometimes less than readable (\" 'tis the seed of wild clymatis, that is named bedwine here, it must grow & tangle these words ere long, or I puff it out again\"). A post-modern novel if there ever was one, Ulverton is nevertheless a better idea than it is a book.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I read every book I could find on the topic. So many parenting books gave conflicting advice. A lot of it was geared towards just the day-to-day business of managing feedings and setting bedtimes. Nowhere could I find advice on how to raise her to be happy... how to teach her that she was in control of her own destiny... how to keep her from falling into self-destructive habits.Now, Alison is an adult, married, a hard worker and excited about life. She takes joy in the little everyday things. She smiles frequently and when she does, she lights up a whole room! Even better... we made it through the turbulent teens and came out the other side as friends! I get texts from her daily telling me about the little, fun things she is doing and I know... I did it!Now her six brothers and sisters (yup, you added right, I have seven children) are following right along in her footsteps. I hear constantly how much people enjoy being around my children. They're certainly not perfect, but they ARE positive, hard-working, persistent and just all around goofballs!Isn't that what you want for your children? (Well, maybe not the goofball part... but honestly, it's a lot of fun in our house!)Where did I learn how to raise children that people actually *like* being around? Well, it wasn't from most of the parenting books I read! Did you know that there are parenting books out there that actually tell parents to withhold love and affection from their children to shame them into behaving? To slap their hands and spank them when they exhibit age-appropriate behaviors that are a part of normal childhood development?Oddly enough, the principles that I use in raising my children... the basic, core beliefs that I use to guide my parenting decisions... came from BUSINESS and SALES books! As a teen, I babysat for an insurance salesman and his wife. After the children were in bed and the kitchen was cleaned up, I loved to read... and their bookshelf was filled with the gurus of sales and positive thinking!As I got older, I added to that study in the field of child development... I taught preschool, nannied, and eventually became not only a nurse (RN), but a Certified Pediatric Nurse (CPN).This book, and the rest in the series, is a message from my heart to yours... because as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once said: \"If you bungle raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do well matters very much.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent the next 30 years in the Marine Corps achieving the highest enlisted rank of Master Gunnery Sergeant, along with having received two accelerated promotions and six medals for achievement.      He is a cum laude graduate of Hawaii Pacific University with a bachelor’s degree in Marketing.  He and his family lived in Japan for six years and he has travelled throughout Asia, including Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, The Philippines, and Thailand; and he has also travelled to Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Johnston Island.       He and his family also lived in Oahu, Hawaii, for eight years, California for fourteen years where he presently lives, New Orleans for three years, and prior to getting married Quantico Virginia for two years.  He has also travelled extensively throughout much of America while being a member of a Marine Corps inspection team.  He credits his broad personal perspective as it relates to people, from his many travels.       He and his wife have been married for twenty-eight years, and they have a lovely daughter and a handsome son who are well-rounded adults.      This is Lawrence’s first foray into writing, and this book is the product of his compulsion to share what he learned during the course of his 30 year career.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After seeing numerous people taken advantage of including myself, I decided it was time to do something about it.These scams are as pernicious in nature and as far reaching in their consequences as any form of deceit that man can devise. We may suffer the loss of a few dollars now but what of our heirs that we wish to leave our legacy to? Imagine the devastation to find out a prized coin handed down through the generations is a mere fraud in a couple hundred years? Every counterfeit and forged coin in existence is a threat to the integrity of our hobby and also where collecting as an investment is concerned. Some coins are very expensive and it would be alarmingly easy to be wiped out financially with the wrong coins!Preserving the integrity of our collections isn't just about preserving our wealth. It is about preserving history. If someone tries adding a VDB to a 1909-S for instance, it means that they just took a semi-key date that is rare and valuable all its own and made it worthless! Just like you might have a rare item but the autograph on it is a forgery. Unless the signature comes off, the item is pretty much ruined! Coins are one piece of metal that essentially cannot be repaired.Coin collecting is perhaps one of the most popular indoor hobbies. So popular in fact that even though the Kennedy half dollars stopped being minted for general circulation they still stamp out millions a year to satisfy collectors demand. Even when they were minted for circulation, almost none circulated because people were hoarding them.A combination of beauty, history, and investment potential drives us to collect coins and by doing so we are preserving our past with every coin telling us a story about where we came from. $20 gold pieces represent the prosperous times of our gold rushes, when our nation was booming. The steel penny tells of our struggle and commitment to defeat Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. Lady Liberty graces many of our coins embodying the beauty of our freedoms. Every coin has its own appeal for its own reasons. Some because of their ease of attainability, others for their extreme rarity making it prestigious to even own them.Not only do coins teach lessons of history, they give us a means to protect ourselves from inflation as a sound investment. Speaking of inflation, I can prove that gasoline is only twelve cents a gallon at the time of this writing! The amount of silver at $35 an ounce in a silver quarter from 1964 or earlier comes out to about $6 or more. Our prices are not going up but rather the value of our money is going down in terms of real wealth and purchasing power. If you ever doubt owning gold and silver a good idea consider this: An ounce of gold is always an ounce of gold. Throughout history the metals have retained their purchasing power relative to other goods. An ounce of gold now will buy relatively the same amount of goods that an ounce of gold bought a thousand years ago.There are risks in everything and nothing is ever guaranteed. I hope you find this book useful in eliminating some of that risk associated with buying coins on the internet as well as the real world. I'd like to see coin collecting remain enjoyable for everyone, of all ages. It is important enough for our youth since coins can fuel their imaginations and cause them to ask questions that they otherwise might not and learn things that just aren't taught in our schools or by parents anymore. There is never such a thing as too much knowledge. The best way to educate and battle the plague of scams is to expose them and teach the average person. The main focus of this book is to warn and prepare you for the dangers that await you in the world of buying coins, bullion, and a few miscellaneous associated collectibles that tend to go with coins and precious metals. I cannot possibly hope to compete with the \"professional\" coin collecting books that can fill entire shelves and warehouses with the information they contain concerning the actual collecting, history, and valuation of coins and currency. What does not seem to exist though is a comprehensive look into the pernicious side of coin dealing which is where this book comes into focus. I am sure that you will agree it is only a matter of time before this book pays for itself.", "related": ["B009MRLVEQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Specifically my parents moved to Morecambe, the seaside and to this day I still love looking at the sea. It's something you'll either 'get' or you won't. But when the wife and I bought our first house together, condition number one was it had to be near the sea. We were lucky enough to pick one with a view right across Morecambe Bay. The town might be struggling, but I've been around the world and have yet to see a better view. Amongst my various qualifications that I have yet to put to use is an MA in Creative Writing from Manchester Metropolitan University. I'd thoroughly recommend the course to anyone interested in writing as it's great to be around like minded folk. I also have a BA (Hons) in English and Urban Policy and a Post Grad Diploma in Management which the NHS (my employer) very kindly paid for. My favourite author is Stephen King and I maintain that when he's on form he's as good as anyone has ever been. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he is often sold short as merely a writer of horror stories. Still, he's hardly struggling for readers. My favourite book is Catcher in the Rye although it's not everyone's idea of fun. I'm also an armchair sportsfan. For football, it's Liverpool. Golf, Tiger Woods. He'll come good. Tennis, Federer, by a distance the best player I've ever seen and I was a big Sampras fan. Most nights I also enjoy an ale. And a gin - specifically Hendricks, there's none finer. I like Port too, but I'm less fussy about the brand. My first novel was Playground Cool, written as part of my MA. It passed with flying colours, I got an agent from my very first letter and then...rejection letters from publishers. I've been close to publication with Transword since with another novel but still the book deal eludes me. I remain undeterred and still write all the time. Plus, the advent of the e-reader has made it possible for anyone to publish so who knows...", "related": [], "rank": 2904555, "title": "All the Fun of the Fair", "author": "Jamie Sinclair", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They were dark green biplanes, with tricolor\nemblems painted on the upper wing and fuselage. \"They're British!\" someone exclaimed, just\nabout the time the unmistakable rattle of Maxim guns drowned out our voices.\"That's not Royal Air\nCorps,\" muttered Sykes. \"Their tricolor is blue, white, and red. These fellows\nare red, white, and blue.\"\"Who uses a red,\nwhite, and blue tricolor?\"He shook his head\nas another burst from the machine guns set the room to screaming. One of the\nplanes took up station about ten yards to the right ofZambesi'sgondola. The other planes pulled up and disappeared above\nus. We heard muffled voices coming from outside, and a steward ran up and\ncranked open one of the promenade windows. We could hear someone in the plane\nshouting through a megaphone, but we could not make out what he was saying. We\nhad no problem making out the shriek of the man who fell past the promenade\nwindows, though. He slid over the curve of the hull, a tangled sheet of white\nsilk flapping wildly behind him, and dropped like a stone towards the ocean\nbelow. Sykes and I looked at each other.\"They're trying to\nboard us,\" I said.\"But how, sir?\nEven if they cut their way in, they would suffocate in a hurry if they tried to\ngo through the gas cells.\"The steward who had\nopened the window overheard us. \"There's an observation hatch in the top of the\nhull. The navigation crew uses it now and then if they need to take sightings.\"\"Go warn the\ncaptain that they're trying to get in,\" I told him. \"We're going to try to stop\nthem.\"Colour Sergeant\nSykes favored me with a hard look as the steward dashed away. \"We're going to\nstop them?\"\"They have no\nreason to suspect that there are armed soldiers on board. That gives us the\nadvantage of surprise.\"We hurriedly\nroused the four soldiers who were not already on duty guarding me. Sykes\nexplained the situation while I worried over the best way to deal with our\nattackers.\"They'll have to\ncome up here,\" I said. \"They have to keep the passengers under control, and\nthey'll want to ransack the staterooms. I think our best course is to ambush\nthem as they come up the stairs, while they're not expecting resistance. What\ndo you think, Colour Sergeant?\"\"An excellent idea,\nsir. You take half of the men and cover the stairs in the passenger lounge. The\nrest of us will prepare a hot reception for them on the stairs in the dining\nroom.\" He nodded at Corporal Singh, who reluctantly handed me his Webley\nservice revolver.We quickly herded\nthe passengers in the lounge back to their staterooms with orders to lie flat\non the floor. A few of the more panicked ones were balky at first, but Corporal\nSingh's stony-faced Sikhs proved to be quite persuasive. Once the passengers\nwere taken care of, I situated the men so they could fire into the lounge stairwell\nwithout being easily observed by someone coming up, and crouched behind a\nwooden divider myself. We didn't have to wait long. Loud voices speaking oddly cadenced\nFrench echoed up the stairwell from the deck below. I held up one hand in a\nsignal for the men to hold their fire; I wanted to wait until the whole group\nwas visible before we began shooting.Five men clambered\nup the stairs: four Asians, one European. All wore fleece-lined leather jackets\nand canvas knapsacks, close-fitting leather flying caps with green tinted\ngoggles, and they were armed with a mismatched assortment of carbines and\npistols. I dropped my hand and four shots echoed through the room. Three of the\nmen fell, and the other two spun around looking for their attackers while\ntrying to bring their guns to bear. I sighted along the barrel of the Webley\nand dropped another man with a bullet in his brain. Corporal Singh and one of\nthe privates fired at the same time and sent the last man tumbling back down\nthe stairs.Scattered shots came\nfrom the other side of the ship; it sounded as though Sykes's men were having a\nbit more difficulty with their quarry. I nodded at Corporal Singh and slipped\nsilently around the stairwell and past the hallway to the passenger staterooms.\nFrom there we could look down into the other stairwell. Two men huddled inside,\npopping out one at a time to fire at Sykes's men, while another man out of\nsight further down the stairs shouted furious imprecations in French. Before\nthe pirates could see us, I ordered my men to fire. Five shots smashed into the\nstairwell and both men fell. The unseen man gave a cry and clattered back down\nthe stairs to the lower 'B' deck.\"Everyone all\nright?\" I called.\"We've got one\ndead and one flesh wound, sir,\" Sykes reported.\"The rest of them\nprobably went for the control room. Do you know where that is?\"Sykes shook his\nhead. \"Corporal Singh, go find one of the stewards.\"He gestured\ntowards the promenade windows. \"The aeroplanes are gone. And our engines are\nstopped.\"I walked over and\nlooked out, but the sky was clear as far as I could see. \"They must have run\nlow on fuel and gone back to their base.\"\"Then how were\nthese men planning to escape?\"\"Look.\" I pointed\nto the west where a steamship was plowing through the waves towards us. \"They'll\nvent our helium until we're close to the water, then transfer their loot to\nthat ship. Once they've taken everything they want, they'll vanish into the\nmangrove swamps around the coast before we can alert anyone.\"", "related": ["B008N4GK36"], "rank": 1031139, "title": "City of Mists (The Age of Aether Book 1) eBook", "author": "Sawyer Grey", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The 1890s were a dark era for many Jews. Between 1887 and the outbreak of World War I, more than 2 million Jews came to America. Most were poor and came from what are now Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and other centers of Eastern European Jewish life. The new arrivals clustered in unsanitary tenements, worked long hours in sweatshops and open air markets, spoke mainly Yiddish and possessed few skills with which to enter the English-language labor force. They faced religious prejudice and the challenges of adapting to an unfamiliar environment. The Forward became a leading advocate for these Jewish immigrants. Named after the great Social Democratic newspaper in Berlin, the Forverts appeared on the streets of New York in April 1897, written entirely in Yiddish. Its first editor was 37-year-old Abraham Cahan.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has worked on many aspects of vision, from feature detection to robust, real-time implementations of practical vision tasks. His interests include automated visual inspection, surveillance, vehicle guidance and crime detection. He has published more than 200 papers, and three books - Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities (1990), Electronics, Noise and Signal Recovery (1993), and Image Processing for the Food Industry (2000); the first of these has been widely used internationally for more than 20 years, and is now out in this much enhanced fourth edition.

He eats meat and makes the mice feel \"edgy.\" Once the house lights are turned off and night closes in, the decorations start looking mighty spooky. Perhaps they're just scary enough to give that pesky cat a fright? Indeed, he ends up being a scaredy cat and the story concludes with the mice partying on. Ehlert uses her signature collage artwork to evoke the textures, shapes, and colors of autumn that pop against the red backgrounds, teal paper, and green vegetables. The art is more frenetic here than in some of her other work, but it suits the story perfectly. It's only natural that the garden would be a whirlwind of activity. The rhyme scheme works well, although there is one odd line: \"Seeing that puss could spoil our summer.\" Yes, \"summer\" rhymes with the previous \"bummer,\" but the action takes place in the fall. The end is enhanced by photos of various squashes, nuts, and fruits (all labeled) as well as a recipe for roasting pumpkin seeds. This title will please Ehlert's fans, and it is tailor-made for autumn-themed programs. Pair it with Anne Rockwell'sApples and Pumpkins(S & S, 1989) or Carin Berger'sThe Little Yellow Leaf(HarperCollins, 2008).—Laura Lutz, formerly at Queens Borough Public Library, NYCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I recently achieved the degree of Certified Professional Photographer (CPP). I really like the technical side of photography - calculating exposure, and understanding how light, camera settings and subjects interact to form a great image.Recently, I studied for and passed the rigorous CPP exam, a two-hour, 100 question test that measures a photographer's understanding of the technology and techniques of photography. The questions in this quiz are similar to the CPP exam questions. I have just separated the questions in to subcategories to help focus the attention. I also provide more questions in my series than the CPP asks in their rigorous examination.If I had encountered this book before I took the CPP exam, I would have run through it several times, to understand my strengths and weaknesses in this area of photography. I hope that you will do the same, to build on the areas of your knowledge, and to understand the areas where you need to develop to master all of the key areas of photography.I encourage you to use all available resources to learn about photography. These quiz books will test your skills, but you will need to consult other sources of knowledge to learn and understand some of the concepts included in the quiz questions. I consulted many sources as I grew as a photographer and studied for the CPP exam. I hope that you will use a broad range of sources to provide you with the challenges to grow as a photographer.", "related": ["B007O4247W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One guy said he thought Heather Graham took the prize hands down, the other guy disagreed, said he believed that Charlize Theron was much hotter.This went on for about ten minutes, as the two men began to toss out other names.Then, out of nowhere, one guy, after slamming a cold, foamy mug of St. Pauli Girl, announced that he thoughts his friend's wife was pretty damn sexy. The friend, who was obviously insecure, did not like the comment. The mood suddenly changed, got quiet.Eventually, an hour later, as the friends watched, on the TV that hung over the bar, the Rangers battle the Flyers, the one guy's cell phone rings. It was the man who had made the comment about the wife, his phone. He got up and took the call in the bathroom. When he returned, the other guy, for whatever reason, maybe because he had a good buzz going, thought his friend had been talking to his wife. (In secret.) Needless to say, they argued, and as they did, I began to write this story on the back of a beer-stained napkin.", "related": ["B00IN1U3ZA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is ordained as an Evangelist from his Parent Organization, World Christianship Ministries Fresno CA receiving an Honorary Dr of Divinity also. Mike moved to Hays KS in 2011, where FAITH CHRISTIAN HOLINESS REVIVAL MINISTRIES was established. One of his goals is to build an Evangelism and Discipleship Ministry with College Students at Fort Hays State University, and also reaching others in the community. He already reached a verbal agreement with the property manager of the FOX PAVILION at $400 an evening - on Monday's. His goal is to bring an awakening to the entire world of the call of Jesus Christ - which he believes will be the 3rd Great Awakening in U. S. History. No man knows the day or the hour except the Father - but the signs in scripture are plain. Matthew 24:14 speaks of the fact that the world will be reached for the gospel before Christ's return. Daniel 12:1 speaks about how every name that is to be written in the \"Book of Life\" will be accomplished. Both are real. Dr David Michael believes he is integral in this. Religious leaders in Uganda wanted for 2 years for Mike to preach in locations in their nation. \"Be not weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap\".

Journey's End, inspired by Sherriff's own experience of fighting, was his sixth play but the first to be given a professional production. It was an immediate, outstanding and phenomenal success. Thirty one separate productions ran concurrently around the world and it was translated into twenty six languages. Its success, however, was both a boon and a burden -- while it allowed him to give up the day job and devote himself full-time to writing, it often overshadowed his later work or was used as the yardstick against which it was measured unfavourably. Fortunately for Sherriff he was not only a playwright but also a novelist and a screenwriter. He wrote a best-selling novel, A Fortnight In September in 1931, and the screenplays for The Invisible Man (1933), The Four Feathers (1939) and classic films such as Goodbye Mr Chips (1939), for which he received an Oscar nomination, and The Dambusters (1955). Although Sherriff was occupied as a playwright and screenwriter he did not lose his urge to write novels and he followed the success of his first novel with The Hopkins Manuscript, Chedworth, Another Year and others. Now, while Journey's End continues to define Sherriff's reputation, much of his work remains ripe for rediscovery.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of my books are based on real places and in\nsome cases on real events, although the places and events are fictionalized. Fictional characters live only because the reader can\nrelate to them and I do my best to make that easy. I hope you enjoy reading my\nbooks and feel free to me or use the contact information at the left if you\nhave any comments or questions. I was born and raised in Decatur, Illinois, but moved to\nthe Moweaqua area around 1991. I like small towns and rural settings, as does\nmy wife of thirty-six years, Barbara. We have two grown children, John and Anna\nto whom I dedicated my first book, The First Suitor. Now after over thirty years of practicing law I would like to write\nfull time, but yet I find myself full time in the law and part time in writing.\nI enjoy telling stories and some would say that all lawyers are born fiction\nwriters, because fiction is all they write in the first place. I have to admit\nthat there is some truth to that. Recently I have retired from the private practice of law\nand now work for the United States Department of Justice. I have now relocated\nto Louisville, Kentucky. I try to draw on my experiences in the practice of law\nand my life experiences in general to give realism to my stories and\ncharacters. In the 1970s I served in the U.S. Army as a Military Policeman and\nin the late '80s, I was a Captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General\nCorps, Army National Guard. I have been to Germany, France, Belgium, Holland,\nand many of the United States. I like to work the settings of the places I've\nbeen and things I've done into my stories. I am foremost and always an entertainer and that is why I\nwrite fiction, but I try to make it real and believable as well as\nentertaining.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Cleve likes Emily's best friend Amy; Amy likes Bart, and Bart develops a crush on Emily. To be near Cleve, Emily relegates herself to the role of his best buddy, and ends up as Bart's date (double dating with Amy and Cleve) for the Spring Fling. The dance is a disaster, but in the next few days, all it takes is a little reshuffling for Emily to get Cleve. Emily has a wonderfully wry sense of humor; she's a lively heroine. But the book could have used fewer plot conveniences (a serious guy like Cleve writes the school newspaper advice column, but Emily has to help him ask his mother if he can date; Bart falls for Emily just in time for the dance), and instead given the characters a chance to act on their own.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0067MSQEC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She chronicles her experiences of ongoing sexual abuse and wonders why “not a single nurse, teacher, or student ever said a word.” Ignored, Dawn withdraws, drinks and continues to be molested by her uncle until she becomes completely demoralized. The author recalls recounts the abuse with unflinching detail; she writes, “instead of standing on the toilet and molesting me, [Uncle Daddy] decided to shower with me instead. Just seeing him naked sent me into a panic which was his desired reaction.” When Dawn eventually enters foster care, Dawn begins to experience a normal lifestyle. The author paints poignant scenes of how ordinary family life affected her. Readers will find themselves completely absorbed in the author’s journey, despite its gruesome details. The author wrote about her horrific childhood , she states, in an effort to change federal law and “remove the Statute of Limitations for sex crimes against children in all fifty states.” She urges people to “ask their representatives where they stand on this issue and what they intend to do about it.A difficult subject, but an important first-person account of sexual abuse.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This play, discovered among his papers and first published in Russia in 1997, is considered his first major work, as the translators explain in their cogent introduction, as it contains in nascent form his principal themes. It is a tragedy that owes a debt to Shakespeare, which the nimble, readable translation makes explicit with its use of loose iambic pentameter. The work contains swerving turns of phrase and ringing contrasts that hint at the glorious writing of the mature Nabokov: “ . . . An ant . . . / Funny, he runs like a man amidst a fire . . . .” This is a work of juvenilia that will attract the specialist and the completist. The speeches often curdle into speechifying, and the work is wildly uneven. The elements are simple enough: a nameless kingdom, a quartet of love stories, nihilistic revolutionaries. But the story of revolt for revolt’s sake is powerful, and the play’s strength is how it dramatizes this excruciating truth. --Michael Autrey", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person. Currently, he has more than twenty books written, most of which are available worldwide as e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Google, Kobo, and Apple.", "related": [], "rank": 407788, "title": "The Secret of Maturity, Third Edition", "author": "Kevin Everett FitzMaurice", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jarvis, author of the Deptford Mice Trilogy, here abandons mice (well, sort of) to concentrate on wee werlings, who can wergle (or transform) themselves into any creature of similar size. Readers will easily identify with seven-year-old Gamaliel Tumpin as he begins the first day of werling school with the same butterflies human children feel, accompanied by his crabby older sister, Kernella (whose \"two prominent peg-shaped teeth... stick out and make her resemble a vexed rabbit\"). She is crazy about popular Finnen Lufkin, who can wergle himself into almost any creature faster than even their jealous tutor, Terser Gibble, can. But trouble brews in Hagwood, and soon wergling won't be enough to protect them from the wasp/spider, Frighty Aggie (\"Would that she were only a nursery bogey.... But she is not. The horror that is Frighty Aggie is as real as you or I. Doubt that at your peril,\" Gibble tells a student), nor from the wrath of wicked Rhiannon, faerie Queen of Hollow Hill. Rhiannon seeks the missing treasure box stolen by the Smith, last of the dwarfs who once served her and her monstrous thorn ogres. Jarvis turns up the volume on his trademark suspense blended with whimsy, and readers are drawn deeper into the magical conflict through Gamaliel and Finnen's involvement. Fun for Hobbit-addicts and Potter-philes of all ages. Next up in this series: The Dark Waters of Hagwood.

Where did it all begin? In 2008, I published my first novel, The Captain’s Lady, a contemporary military romance, through The Wild Rose Press. I’ve since received the rights back from my publisher, and I rewrote the book and republished it with a brand new title, Saved. I write edgy romantic suspense (Walk the Right Road Series), western romance (Finding Love ~ The Outsider Series), and young adult mystery, and I warn my readers to expect the unexpected. I’m a mother of three children and we live on a small island in the Pacific Northwest. I encourage you to contact me by email; I do answer every email I receive. Stay tuned. There is more to come from the Walk the Right Road Series and Finding Love ~ The Outsider Series, as well as a brand new western romance series coming later this fall, The One.

Miriam fights the shallow temptations of popularity, Kate's infatuation with Matthew depletes her sense of self, and Matthew struggles for control of his genuine-but inconsistent-feelings for Kate. The plot hangs loosely on a contest between the cheerleaders and the audio lab for student government funds, but it's the characters who drive the story. They battle their consciences, reflect on the passage of time, and realize that their parents are human beings; they are poignantly bewildered by childhood's retreat. As Kate thinks while pondering the stars one evening, \"Life really isn't about fun anymore. It's about bigger things now.\" The cover will entice children to this breezy story, but the depth of feeling will make them remember it.

He also earned a Master’s degree in tax law from the University of San Diego in 1987. In April 1974, Marc began the practice of law in Ohio.  By November 1974, he had to stop practicing law because he was exhausted, in pain, emotionally upset, depressed, constantly hungry, confused, and impaired.  He was burned out.   From 1974 to 1991, Marc passed all of his standard medical tests but no one could figure out why he ended up sleeping 20 hours per day; he couldn’t sleep without sleep medication because of his Fibromyalgia pain. Then, in 1992 and afterward, his doctors and healers discovered he suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Gulf War Syndrome, Depression, Heavy Metal Toxicity, Chronic Yeast Infection, Chronic Mycoplasma Infection, Obesity, internal Alcoholism, Celiac Disease, Immune System Dysfunction, Sjögren’s Syndrome, Enzyme Deficiency, and other maladies, which are revealed in this book. This book is the story of how Marc overcame his illnesses to become a writer, singer, loving husband, attorney, mentor, executive, caregiver, co-chairman of a chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia support group for more than 400 people in San Diego, California, with Josephine Nost, world traveler, motorcyclist and scuba diver.   Marc’s recovery is remarkable because his brain, and almost all of his vital organs and systems, were impaired.  Along his ROAD TO RECOVERY, he discovered new answers to some basic questions: Why am I ill and what can be done about it? This book was written with the hope that the information provided will help those who suffer from the same illnesses.", "related": [], "rank": 4182992, "title": "Road to Recovery: New Techniques for Healing", "author": "Marc Herlands", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Coleman. Currently I am 32 years old originally from Charlotte, NC. I'm the Author of the novel, \"Bless Da Child Dat Holds His Own\" and \"No the Hell She Didn't.\" In order to view my novels cover page and synopsis, Google my name and book title. I simply love to write. I feel as though I was blessed with the talent to use my imagination, create characters and share with the world my stories. I'm very versatile and professionally good at what I do. Along with writing novels, I definitely read a lot, personal fitness trainer, write screen plays, stage plays and I've just completed a Children's Entrepreneur book. I'm all for accomplishing goals and striving for success. Slowly but surely, my hard work is now finally starting to pay off. I can't stop and I definitely won't stop pushing myself to succeed. I have a mind that never stops working. The brain I have is loaded with many ideas and plans. I keep myself occupied and I'm never bored because I'm always working on something which will help me in the future. Nothing comes to those who wait for handouts. I believe no human who has mobility, in good shape and good health should wait for anything. Get up off your behind and get it! Stop depending on the finances of others and make things happen for yourself. If they succeeded, so can you. I sincerely believe in getting things done. If you have any questions or any comments about any of my novels, feel free to speak your mind or you can contact me via email at wbcoleman81@gmail.com or PenPushingPublishingLLC@gmail.com Thanks.

Trow's Lestrade is all too human but more competent than Conan Doyle's. This 11th entry in Trow's Lestrade series provides a good time and a vatful of fascinating Victorian lore. It's 1895, and the inspector (last seen in Lestrade and the Magpie) is desperate to stop a homicidal maniac who is killing women on the Underground. Since the murders appear to be random, Lestrade has difficulty constructing a trail, and his frustration mounts with each death. As if the case were not challenging enough, Lestrade must also contend with cranky bosses, green underlings (excepting the loyal Constable Walter Dew), and mysterious \"relatives\" of the victims who show up at the station house. Then there's the distraction of the highly appealing Trottie True, the sister of one of the victims. The possible suspects are nicely drawn, and the cameo appearances by many famous VictoriansAthe Marquess of Queensbury and Aubrey Beardsley among themAturn this book into a kind of parlor game. The ending yields a rather arbitrary but adequate villain. But the plot is incidental; the heart of this story lies in its clever, lively language. The brazen wordplay occasionally may elicit a groan, but much more often a smile.

His interest in history and the story possibilities that it presents to fiction writing have melded into the themes that run through The Emperor of Carysfort Reef: Resurrection. His careers in the U.S. Army, in law enforcement, and ultimately in the U.S. Intelligence Community each provided a rich school for his writing.

Rejected at an early age by her parents, Victoria is sent to Dallas to live with her childless aunts, Charlotte and Mary. Charlotte is a wealthy widow, and Mary is clairvoyant. Mary has seen the difficult road ahead for Victoria if she makes the wrong choices. Because of this, Charlotte, Mary, and Victoria's maternal grandparents, Chandra and Ed, shower Victoria with love and encourage her unique intelligence and talents to help keep her on the right path. However, Clyde and Tess, along with Clyde's domineering, voodoo practicing mother, Betts, begin to spitefully interfere and attempt to crush and cower Victoria's spirit. Can Victoria withstand the vindictive influence of Betts and her parents? Will she be able to remain true to her faith and herself to overcome the trials of her childhood and find her destiny as an adult?

Brad Mitchell is a realtor with a comfortable life in North Carolina. At the funeral of his ex-girlfriend, Kara Tinsley, whom he dated in college, Brad reconnects with Margot Cominsky, another college friend. Margot, too, has settled into adulthood, running a muffin business, but Kara was wild to the end, dying of a drug overdose. At the funeral, Kara&'s oafish roommate, Steve Donegan, astonishes everyone by revealing that he and Kara were engaged—something neither Brad nor Margot knew, even though both kept in touch with Kara after college. Doubting the circumstances of Kara&'s death, Margot investigates and uncovers some unnerving information about Steve. Reluctantly, Brad is drawn into Margot&'s investigation, though he is distracted by the specter of a miscarriage that haunts his marriage. But that&'s not the only ghost haunting Brad: Kara appears periodically for a chat. Although the denouement is disappointing, Conescu&'s characters are believable, and he carries off Kara&'s ghost scenes without melodrama or portent. Neither a true ghost story nor a grisly murder mystery, this novel is a solid, entertaining read. Agent: Bill Clegg, WME Entertainment.

It contains important and sometimes overlooked topics on triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles such as the Menelaus-Ceva theorem, Simson’s line, Heron’s formula, and the theorems of the three altitudes and medians. It can also be used by professors as a resource to stimulate the abstract thinking required to transcend the tedious and routine, bringing forth the original thought of which their students are capable. Methods of Solving Complex Geometry Problemswill interest high school and college students needing to prepare for exams and competitions, as well as anyone who enjoys an intellectual challenge and has a special love of geometry. It will also appeal to instructors of geometry, history of mathematics, and math education courses.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wrote for\n a small town newspaper as a correspondent. I didn't make much money but\n I loved it. Then I just found myself writing more and more. I began to\nwrite plays and some of them were performed in my church. One of my\nplays titled Gotta Love It  won Saskatchewan's Rural Writing\ncontest and was performed by The Dancing Sky Theatre in Meacham,\nSaskatchewan. It was thrilling to have a professional theatre troupe\nperform my work. I guess it all spiralled from there. My family and I\nmoved to an acreage as the kids started getting older and I decided to\ntry my hand at writing a book. That's when Deep Bay Vengeance was born. It took me a couple years but I did it. And then it's sequel was born: Deep Bay Relic.You talk about your books like they are your children. Why is that? Yes!\n I like to refer to them as my children. Every word, every sentence,\nevery chapter was uniquely crafted together just like when you're\nexpecting a baby. It takes a lot of work to grow a baby. Nine months of\nwatching your stomach grow. It took me a lot longer to grow my books but\n little by little I watched it get bigger and bigger until it became a\nreal story. And the characters in it grew as well. One by one they were\nborn. Writing is a deep personal thing really. So much of myself comes\nthough without me even realizing it. Bit by bit the books takes on a\npersonality of their own until one day, labour starts and a newborn\nstory is born. My story, by characters, my baby. They hold a special\nplace in my heart. That's kind of strange I know. People call me crazy.\nThat's okay, I kind of am. You have to be if you want to write. But I\nwouldn't have it any other way.Why do you write Christian fiction? I settled on\nwriting Christian fiction because my faith is important to me. I want\neveryone to know God. I've been through a lot of hard things in my life\nand without God, I wouldn't have made it. I really believe that and I\nwant other people to have that as well. So, I write Biblical truths into\n my character's lives and God's love into every story I write.What process of writing do you use? Well, I'm a\nnon-traditional writer. I don't like to pre-plan anything. I don't have\ncharts and notes or anything like that. I sit down and place my fingers\non the keyboard and start to type. I've talked to other writers who\ncan't understand my technique but that's okay. Every writer is\ndifferent. I guess for me, I just love a good surprise. I like not\nknowing what is around the corner or who will get into trouble next. The\n best way to describe the way I write is, writing by the seat of my pants.\n Usually I shock myself by writing a character off that I didn't expect\nto. I've cried my heart out over the death of a character I didn't\nintend to kill off. It's crazy I know, but that's part of the thrill of\nwriting for me. I'm just as surprised as my readers when something bad\nhappens. I like that!What do you think makes a good story? I think a\ngood story should have a little bit of everything. Though I like to\nwrite suspense/thrillers it wouldn't be a good book if it didn't have\nromance mixed with it. My characters also have to go through a moral\nstruggle and come out learning a lesson. That is a must. And when I\nwrite, I like to leave a person hanging with something suspenseful. Each\n page, each chapter, has to grab me, and ultimately has to grab the\nreader. If it doesn't, I'm bored and I just don't read it. I think my\nreaders feel the same way and so that is why I deliver that to them.What style of writing do you like best? I like to\nwrite in the third person. First person bothers me. I guess because it\ndoesn't sound real to me. I have to read and write realistically. I have\n a problem with fantasy. My kids make fun of me because I don't like\nfairy tales but that's just me.

I've always loved writing, but it wasn't until I spent three years as a batboy for the Pittsburgh Pirates in the early 1990s that I truly realized I would rather put words in actor's mouths than have the words come out of mine on camera.  When a Pirates promotional commerical was set to start filming at Three Rivers Stadium, the lead actor was nowhere to be found. I was asked to step in. Thus began my extremely brief and lackluster career as an actor in which I appeared in a few commercials, a brief minute on a forgettable television show, a music video and five or so feature-length films including the Oscar winner \"The Silence of the Lambs\".  After honing my less than desirable acting chops, I had an epiphany: I am a better writer than actor and would rather write than recite. So, here I am.  I am the screenwriter of the screenplay THE GATEKEEPER and co-screenwriter of the adapted screenplay for the Leah Leonard novel ROAD TO CASABLANCA. My first book, \"Relics of God: A Supernatural Guide to Religious Artifacts, Sacred Locations & Holy Souls\" has been a huge success and is available on Amazon as well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But when an old school friend picks up on a serious misjudgment Helen has made and threatens her with exposure, Helen momentarily loses control. As a policewoman, she knows exactly how the police will investigate the man’s death, and she uses her insider knowledge to cover her tracks. But with the fear of discovery hanging over her, Helen feels increasingly backed into a corner. Fearful and fragile, she begins covering up the evidence, but eventually she’s forced to face the fact that discovery of her crime is imminent—and by the one colleague she really likes and trusts. At first, readers will feel sympathy for the hapless Helen, but, as the story progresses, it becomes more difficult to like her. A shock ending forces us to decide whether Helen is a young woman caught up in a terrible series of events, or whether she is evil personified—or something in between.

In Missional Orthodoxy, Gary Tyra supplies believers with the tools necessary to understand their calling and engage their context. This book is a valuable resource for pastors and laypeople alike.\" (Ed Stetzer, president of LifeWay Research)\"A provocative effort to bridge the divide between the evangelical and emerging church worlds by drawing from a missional understanding of a missionary God who is active in the world. Tyra carefully grounds his proposal in a high Christology and then uses Borg and McLaren as conversation partners to work out a centered understanding of the Christian faith in relation to the classic systematic theological loci. The reader will appreciate this fresh approach to reengaging the riches of the Christian tradition.\" (Craig Van Gelder, professor of congregational mission, Luther Seminary)\"Gary Tyra forges a path for contemporary ministry and discipleship between extremes of neofundamentalism and a new liberalism--both of which are becoming popular and influential, especially among young evangelicals.A Missional Orthodoxyis a powerful explanation and endorsement of a both-and rather than either-or approach to issues facing evangelicals in today's postmodern and post-Christian culture. I cannot recommend it highly enough to evangelicals and others seeking a contextually sensitive faith that avoids overaccommodation to culture.\" (Roger E. Olson, Foy Valentine Professor of Christian Theology and Ethics, George W. Truett Theological Seminary)\"Gary Tyra has set himself a daunting task, to develop a theology that is both missional and orthodox. On the whole, he makes an important contribution and enriches the discussion by bringing a Pentecostal perspective into it. He is an orthodox theologian who engages complementary traditions graciously and appreciatively and thus practices what some have called 'a more generous orthodoxy.'\" (Darrell L. Guder, Henry Winters Luce Professor of Missional and Ecumenical Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary)\"Good missional theology is essential to funding transformative missional movements over the long term. Given the strident voices to the left and the right, we could use more compassionately orthodox guides in the conversation. Gary's new book goes a long way to filling the need.\" (Alan Hirsch, author and founder of Forge Missional Training Network and Future Travelers, www.alanhirsch.org)\"The question today is how the church can contextualize its message to engage the culture without watering down the gospel. InA Missional Orthodoxy, Gary Tyra calls the church to embrace a vision that is both thoroughly missional and deeply orthodox at the same time. It is a vision that allows the church to steer clear of the common mistakes of overcontextualization on the one hand and irrelevancy on the other.

In Honeybee's Poem, Vuuren offers general information about honeybees,\nmuch of which is elaborated upon in other editions in the series. Told in the\nform of a poem, and accompanied by lively, colorful illustrations by Sudipta\nDasgupta, Honeybee's Poem is presented in a simple to read font. Opening with a\nhive hanging from a tree, the text instructs young readers about how a honeybee\nhatches from an egg to larva, spins a cocoon, and ultimately breaks free. The\nbee's eyes, tongue, antennae, thorax, legs, and other body parts are presented\nin colorful and interesting illustrations. Vuuren then proceeds to identify the\nqueen bee, drones, and worker bees by gender and chore. The general\ninformation in Honeybee's Poem is instructional and easy to understand and is\npresented in an easy to read format. Added to the text are delightful\nillustrations. The bright yellow, smiling honeybees forage from flower to\nflower, and even share a dance with their cohorts to instruct them as to where\nthose flowers may be found. Followed by a word list, teachers will have found a\nteaching aid that includes all the important information at the turn of a page.\nBest of all, children will be turning those pages quickly and repeatedly as\nthey investigate the lively and curious world of the honeybee.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The heroine is Claudia Hampton, an unconventional historian and former war correspondent who lies in a hospital bed dying of cancer. Forced inward, Claudia moves randomly across time and place to reconstruct the strata of her life. But \"most lives have their core, their kernel, the vital centre\"; Claudia's is the brief, tragic encounter she had in Egypt during the war with Tom Southern, a British tank officer on leave from battle. Tom's voice, along with those of her brother and daughter, joins Claudia's to shape a narrative that is a complex, intricately composed fugue. This haunting evocation of loss is Lively's finest achievement yet.Laurence Hull, Cannon Memorial Lib., Concord, N.C.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 321677, "title": "Moon Tiger (Oberon Modern Plays)", "author": "Penelope Lively", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is also the author of a comic memoir about depression, which was published by an award-winning independent press just prior to its bankruptcy announcement. Despite this career trajectory, Wendy's greatest satisfaction comes from working with young people who are motivated to write simply because they find it fun.Wendy currently lives on Long Island, New York, where she enjoys jumping to conclusions and making sweeping generalizations with her husband and their three cats.Reviews for Hide & Seek: How I Laughed at Depression, Conquered My Fears and Found Happiness (Kunati, 2008)\"In her efforts to subdue raging depression, TV and stage writer Aron tried to no avail virtually every mainstream and alternative remedy. Her adventures among the lunatic fringe are laugh-out-loud funny. In the end, Aron gets her life together by dismissing all of the 'miracle cures' and discovering herself. Anyone who has overcome recurring bouts with the blues will relish this comic self-help tale.\" --School Library Journal\"Sitcom writer Wendy Aron has written a hysterically funny book about a very unfunny subject: being paralyzed by depression. Perhaps more neurotic than Woody Allen and just as funny, Aron survives a year of self-help groups and therapy by homing in on the scariness and inanities of the meetings.

The spiritual advisors are Yogi, Joy, Zac, and Seth (Yes, confirmed to be the same Seth who produced the SETH Material with Jane Roberts). Rainbow Walker is an important name to connect with these teachings. A rainbow is important because it is bright and energetic. A rainbow encompasses the light in beautiful ways, it brings smiles to people and it is magical when it manifests itself. It is no coincidence that a rainbow comes after a storm or a rain shower; it shows people that they have come through the darkness and back into the light. This is symbolic of our mission. Matthew Douglas was born and raised in a small Indiana town in the United States and is the youngest of four siblings.  He faced many challenges in life, which provided him with the growth he needed to step forward into this expression of his true purpose. Matthew realized he was a natural channel for Rainbow Walker in 2003 and has been channeling them ever since. He is dedicated to sharing their transformative information with the world, working closely with his personal spirit guide, Zac.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
