Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to VORTEX SCIENCE FICTION. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her Darkover novels. In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including Marion Zimmer Bradley's FANTASY Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called SWORD AND SORCERESS for DAW Books. Over the years she turned more to fantasy. She wrote a novel of the women in the Arthurian legends--Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and others--entitled MISTS OF AVALON, which made the NY Times best seller list both in hardcover and trade paperback, and she also wrote THE FIREBRAND, a novel about the women of the Trojan War.

In 10 articles by noted science writers and fabulists, this slim volume separates fact from fiction in Crichton’s best-known yarns. Computer science innovator Ray Kurzweil scrutinizes virtual reality as depicted in The Terminal Man (1972) and concludes that, although Crichton’s dystopian vision may go to extremes, the technology of melding minds with microchips may be quite close to possible. Anthropologist Ian Tattersall takes on Crichton’s overstated depiction of Neanderthals in Eaters of the Dead (1976). The most outstanding contribution, however, is meteorologist David Lawrence’s skewering of State of Fear (2004), Crichton’s loosely fictionalized attempt to debunk global warming. Here, Lawrence forcefully argues that whatever writing chops Crichton possesses, sometimes he gets the science far more wrong than right. --Carl Hays", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

J. Connolly was a research engineer and middle manager at NASA's Glenn Research Center from 1961 to 1997.  He received a Ph.D. in engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 1971.

Several decades of observation and analysis made Mr. Connolly aware of a dirty little secret.  Our political class has long been working a scam to shift legislative power from bodies elected by \"We the People\" to our unaccountable legal aristocracy.  So, in early 1997, Connolly decided to retire from his career in the physical sciences and write a book exposing the dirty little secret.  He's been seeking out material, writing, and revising ever since.  His two non-fiction books describing the scam are both available in Amazon.com's digital test format.  Connolly also maintains web pages which feature various chapters in the current version. Blowing the whistle on America's oldest and most successful criminal enterprise is hard and stressful work.  During his long and frequent vacations Connolly writes fiction.

According to the author, the Anglican Calvinist p. 252 clergyman was not only America's earliest popular hero but also the first to unite the colonies in a sense of common identity. With his single-minded emphasis on regeneration, he introduced into religion the personal, privatistic piety that is today characteristic of the evangelical movement. As the title suggests, the key to Whitefield's success on both sides of the Atlantic is to be found in his theatricality. He quickly recognized the power of open-air field preaching. He was a shameless, egotistical self-promoter who, in a startling parallel with modern televangelists, consciously (albeit sincerely) employed histrionics \"with all the dramatic artifice of a huckster,\" a traveling salesman for the New Birth. By the end, according to Stout, there was no private person, only the public preacher. This book reflects exhaustive research and offers a solid portrait of a person of pivotal importance to present-day evangelicalism.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Contrasting their foreign and domestic policies, cultures, and geographies, Bahl measures their potential for economic growth. Though China doubles its economy every eight years and \"spends  billion every day to develop world class infrastructure,\" India has its own advantages: it is the world's largest democracy, 350 million of its people speak English, half its population is under 25, and it boasts a \"robust judicial system.\" Furthermore, India impressed the world with its resilience to the global economic crisis, rebounding with modest inflation, while China experienced deflation and a huge debt. But Bahl warns that India's dithering government could obstruct its potential, lamenting its failure to improve India's crumbling infrastructure while China's \"democratic dictatorship\" could stymie growth by discouraging innovation. Though the book offers valuable insights into the motivations of the world's two most populous countries, it could have been more tightly edited to eliminate repetition, clichés, and some awkward--occasionally bombastic--phrasing (\"India's macroeconomics was beginning to allure\").

Capps comes at psychosis from multiple, well-considered angles, including placing delusional thought patterns in the context of a client’s overall life story; the effects of psychosis on family members and the community (and, to a lesser degree, the transition from institutional care to community-based services); proactive and reactive treatment modalities; and seeking a common definition for the idea of “mental stability.” Capps’ inquiry is neither oversimplified, nor is it bogged down by providing elaboration where none is indicated.

The same thing happens to heiress Molly Benson, the main character in Emerson's sobering first novel. Molly has long been obsessed with the English author, and especially with his feeling for the Third World; she met Greene in Antibes in 1977, and has corresponded with him since. (The bits of Greene's letters included here are really his, a preface statesAhe sent them \"to an American friend.\") Molly's brother, Harry, a political journalist, diedAnobly, she believesAin Central America, in 1981. The narrative begins in 1991 with Greene's own death, which proves another turning point in Molly's life: she decides to travel to Algeria \"in the hope of rescuing a few writers there.\" There, Molly, accompanied by a childhood friend and a British graduate student she met in a bookstore, descends upon two monks, one the brother-in-law of her mother's hairdresser. Selfish in their intended selflessness, the well-meaning Americans disrupt the monks' lives, inspire a violent uprising in the casbah and end up endangering the people they came to save. Her Algerian experiences force Molly to confront reality, and undermine her ideas about her brother and about Greene. Emerson's nonfiction includes Winners & Losers (about the Vietnam War, and a National Book Award winner) and Gaza: A Year in the Intifada. Obviously, her travels and her research inform this fascinating chronicle of Algeria's political plight in the early '90s. Greene's devotees will enjoy the ways in which Emerson's prose and plots respond to Greene'sAa touch of The Quiet American here, a bit of The Power and the Glory there. But MollyAher stubborn na?vet?, her self-importance and her eventual disillusionAwill be the focus of the readers' attention. In Emerson's hands, she is both pathetic and sympathetic. At the same time, the novel raises provocative questions about \"benign\" tourism, politics and charity, questions about good intentions and about unintended, disastrous effects.

We are scrambling to keep up with this new turn of events just as Bly is and that makes the story gripping. And then, just as the accident becomes a reality, suddenly things change again, and the reader is trying to regain his/her wits just as Bly is. Together, we are in a new place, with unfamiliar people...one of whom is very mysterious. There's something about Adolfo that neither Bly nor the reader can figure out (along with the mystery of why she is not in a hospital), and yet it remains an interesting mystery, not a frustrating one. The tone and tension of this piece are very well done, and a great example of young adult fiction. It reads very well for that audience yet works on an adult level as well. Bly is a well written character that is very relatable without being a stock character. I would be very interested to read more of this story and see where it leads.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this compelling adventure story with a highly realized Alaskan setting, two cousins set out on a kayak trip, expecting to return before their mothers even realize they are gone. From the outset, things go awry. Cody, the wilderness aficionado, immediately gets her only pair of socks wet; Derek, the \"lower-forty-eight\" city slicker isn't even wearing socks. Things don't get better: Cody encounters a bear and begins to mull over her parents' recent divorce; the campsite is completely flooded, all the supplies are lost; and Cody is temporarily blinded by a serious sunburn to her eyes. Eventually the pair is rescued, but not before they've showed their courage. A solid, readable, well-researched novel with good plotting and convincing characters, this has all the elements a good survival story should have.Shelley Townsend-Hudson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Luckily for 13-year-old Amy, Clover belongs to her. The 17-year-old is working for a lifestyle magazine during her gap year before college. She writes the “agony aunt” advice column but is not satisfied with simply offering ideas to love-struck teens–she much prefers fixing problems herself, taking on cheating boyfriends and cruel girls in stunts that are creative as well as effective. Amy is kept quite busy helping Clover with the column, taking care of her baby brother and sister, and weathering the challenges of her blended family. Will it all prove to be too much when a boy from her art class starts to take an interest in her? This novel is set in Ireland, which gives it extra culture points as well as some unfamiliar vocabulary. Who knew that the whiny rich girls in Dublin are called D4s?

In studying the principles and counselling approaches mentioned in this book over the past fifteen years and applying them to his own life, he has managed to rid himself of a disorder called GAD (generalised anxiety disorder). In January 2000, just as he was completing his master's thesis, David suffered from a panic attack and subsequently went into a depression for a few months. This painful experience helped him gain some real insight into what people go through when in a depressive state and he thus knows what works and how to achieve long-term recovery from both depression and anxiety. By using the tools and techniques outlined in this book, David managed to lift himself out of fear and anxiety and achieve some great successes, including becoming a black belt in tae kwon do and becoming a registered psychologist both in South Africa and Australia. He understands the power of goal setting, commitment and discipline and the principles in motivating yourself to take action. He has helped people with anxiety disorders, depression, low self-esteem, and those who just found themselves lost in life and needing some coaching and guidance to take their next step forward. In addition to working as a psychologist, David has worked in the field of human resources for several years while further developing his ideas and tools for positive change. He has counseled managers, staff, and private clients over this time and has always enjoyed helping people take action and find a new meaning in their lives. He sees amazing changes in people when they use the tools described in this book. David's interest in writing began at 14 when he wrote a compelling short story about two police detectives, set in Los Angeles. He lives in Sydney with his wife, Michelle, and two boys, Jake and Brandon. David welcomes any feedback you have on this book", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book demonstrates what should never have been doubted: that the venture of Islam - like the venture of Christianity or Buddhism or Judaism - has been enacted by none other than practising human beings who wish to know why they are 'here,' why they live, and why they suffer and to discover how they can live better while they are 'here.' The answers that are given are the results of human reason, but the language in which such answers are formed may be the language of science, the language of religion, the language of the enlightenment, the language of the church, or the language of Islam. This book goes some good and necessary distance in dispelling the current darkness, and I am grateful to its author for having written it.'

It is a metropolis reminiscent of New York City, so large that it would take various days to explore on foot. Fortunately, Madrid has one of the most transportation-friendly places on Earth with multiple ways of getting around.Madrid is an ideal walking city. There are many metro lines, which one can take from the airport to the center of the city-and it only takes about 20 minutes and costs 2 Euros! It is considered by many to have the best public transportation in the world, with taxi, train, bus, and metro systems. It is no wonder people really get to make the most out of their visit to the city.The food in Spain is always amazing, and in Madrid you have access to the best of the best. There are so many restaurants, with more and more opening constantly. Some of the dishes that you need to try in Madrid are the Cochinillo (baby pig), Churros with Chocolate, and Madrelian Soup. Madrid is also an ideal place to sample food from other Spanish regions, and one of the best places to enjoy dishes from Northern Spain is Casa Mingo, which serves up traditional food from Asturias (the greenest and northest region in Spain.)The attractions here range from El Prado Museum, which is considered to be only second to the Louvre. Then we have Gran Via, which is often referred to as the \"Spanish Broadway\" because it resembles Broadway in New York City. Plaza Cibeles, the square where the Real Madrid soccer team celebrates its victories, and Sol in the center of the city are also must-see attractions.Nightlife in this vivacious city offers something for everyone. You can head out to Serrano 41 and then make your way through bars and clubs in Chuca. Around 3 am you can head over to Kapital or Pacha and party into the wee hours of the morning till around 6 am. At that time make way to Chocolateria San Gines and get yourself Churros with Chocolate to get you through the early stages of your hangover.Overall Madrid is my favorite city in Spain, a place that I consider a second home. With so many friendly people and a significant international crowd all year round, this is the place to be if you love culture, history, art, and mouth-watering foods. I guarantee you will want to come back.David Hoffmann, Davidsbeenhere.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A vacant lot reclaimed by a city in Palm Beach County, Florida, the dog park named \"Faux Paws\" became a daily routine for designer dogs, pedigrees, hounds, mutts and their owners of various \"human-breeds\" as well. Animally bonded, the K-9s and their respective 401K owners all seem to be appropriately matched in temperament, personality and intelligence. With names like Moe &amp; Lucky, Gimp &amp; Muffle, Ramon &amp; Lolita, and of course the mayor Eddie, and his dog won from a church prize, Bingo, these duos split each afternoon to go to their separate respective areas within Faux Paws; some go to the big dog area, others to the small dog section, while the owners pack in to a gazebo to talk. I must admit, as a disclaimer, I am a dog lover extraordinaire, so reading this book was like rolling on my back having my tummy scratched. As much as I have come to love and understand the wonders of \"Man's best friend,\" I too become emotionally outraged when hearing about animal cruelty; especially when intentionally done. Therefore I could relate to the emotions and motivations of the human characters in Mayor of the Dog Park; to me the events seem as logical as a border collie retrieving a tennis ball.", "related": [], "rank": 3488708, "title": "Mayor of the Dog Park", "author": "Anne Gilbert", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After being an outcast child prodigy it was no surprise when she graduated from one of the many fine University of California schools a year early to follow her girlfriend in a cross country move. She writes a free-lance sex advice column found in various lesbian magazines and dating websites. Her short story collections and novels can be found on her website. Two of her greatest prides are being a true California girl and author of some truly naughty things. She is a dutiful partially-Asian daughter who is beloved by her fairly traditional Korean father who thinks having a gay daughter is just fine as long as she keeps playing coed flag football. She is a stereotypical younger sister, and an adoring aunt of a hilarious little boy. Being a modern techno-freak, gamer-girl, she spent most of her childhood dreaming of being a video game designer, but changed her mind and brought her dreams of world building and story-weaving to writing unique romance novels. Cassandra is a gleefully monogamous girlfriend to an earthbound goddess who was once her high school bully, but has done a magnificent job of making up for all the school girl nastiness ever since. When she isn’t being an avid fang girl (vampire fan girl) or tormenting people in online gaming, she lives and writes in Winter Park, Florida with her partner and soul mate Nichole and their two cats: Dragon and Josephine.", "related": ["B00LVNCLWA"], "rank": 1322320, "title": "The Vampires of Vigil's Sorrow", "author": "Cassandra Duffy", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But, there is always a \"but\", isn't it?First of all Miquel is very dangerous to know, he is a marine creature with paranormal power and can turn a woman into a marine creature. But it is not all - the sea has a primary role in the story. The sea is angry in a terrifying way and the two protagonists have to discover why it is so pissed off.Following Miquel, Iris and their romance you will have a very enjoyable reading experience and find out the answers of all your curiosities. By ROMANCE LOVER", "related": ["B00IDQD24E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With astonishing new evidence, author B. G. Sidharth proves that the earliest portions of the R. g Veda, the world’s oldest sacred teachings, can be dated back as far as 10,000 B.C. For more than a century scholars have debated the antiquity of Indian culture and the Vedas; relying upon a host of Eurocentric assumptions, they regard 1500 B.C. as the earliest possible date for the writing of the R. g Veda. Sidharth stands this belief on its head, revealing why the Vedas are, in fact, nearly eight-and-a-half millennia older.Sidharth provides incontrovertible evidence that such advanced “European” astronomical concepts as precession, heliocentrism, and the eclipse cycle were first discovered and encoded in these ancient Indian texts, passages of which make perfect sense only if their astronomical keys are known.And by deciphering the astronomical events and alignments contained in mythical and symbolic form in these ancient texts, he uncovers the key and calls into question many--if not all--of the assumptions governing Indo-European prehistory. He explores such subjects as the astronomical significance of Hindu deities and myths, the system of lunar asterisms used to mark time, the identity of the A´svins, and the sophisticated calendar of the ancients that harmonized solar and lunar cycles. Using internal evidence from the Maha-bha-rata and Ra-ma-yan. a, he also becomes the first to establish likely dates--and even places--for the events described in these famous epics.The Celestial Key to the Vedasis a groundbreaking book, one that is sure to astonish anyone interested in astronomy, spirituality, India, or the origins of science and civilization.DR. B. G. SIDHARTH is director of India’s B. M. Birla Science Center.He has over thirty years of experience in astronomy and science education and is a frequent consultant to astronomy journals and science centers around the globe.He lives in Hyderabad, India.", "related": ["B009O04WC4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Author David Tossell's wonderful ride through the summer of 1976 brings the series to life...makes the reader feel like it was yesterday - Peter Sharkey, Birmingham Post. Enough dynamite to ignite the soul of even the most somnolent cricket fan...relevant, pithy and often amusing...this is a terrific piece of work. The photographs are splendid too: look at the cover image, which captures exactly why Holding could scare a batsman witless - Andrew Baker, The Daily Telegraph  \"Book of the Week. David Tossell has done a fine job in setting the series in a social as well as cricketing context as he interrogates many of the main protagonists in that ill-tempered series -  Independent on Sunday. 1976 was the summer when Viv Richards announced himself as the game's pre-eminent batsman and West Indies unveiled a four-paceman strategy, led by the magnificent Michael Holding, which made them the dominant force in world cricket for the next 15 years or so. David Tossell fills in the details in a highly enjoyable book, not only focusing on the cricket but also its impact on the Caribbean community in the UK, which followed the team in huge numbers and generated such a vibrant atmosphere at the grounds - Paul Grunill, cricket editor, BBC Sport website. Like watching a television documentary, the cricketing events are interspersed with some very revealing quotes from the players involved, which add to the colour and pungency of an already heady mix. Tossell also interweaves comment on the social backdrop of the era with potted histories of players and connected events. There seems to be an autobiographical tinge, which, again, adds to one's immersion in the drama. Humorous anecdotes round off a well-told tale. Eight central pages of black and white, and colour photographs convey the grace, power and drama. I enjoyed the book - it is easy to read, exciting and well written - Krishna Mahadevan, BBC Sport website reader review. Book of the month. A great read and a great book. Anyone interested in cricket will love it.

He was also the first to provide evidence supporting Dan Kosahland’s theory of \"ultrasensitivity\". His research activities, which span the best part of 30 years, yielded an extensive list of publications of which four are single-author publications in peer-reviewed journals. He is currently a professor of biotechnology at Sharda University, Greater Noida, India.Dr. Charlie Brycehas held posts as Head of the School of Life Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Sciences for over 20 years at Edinburgh Napier University. For the last three years, he focused on International Development for the Faculty of Health, Life and Social Sciences and, more recently extended this to developing international research and technology transfer links for all areas of the university. He now acts as an independent international consultant for program development, learning support material development including e-learning, continuing professional development, and quality assessment and audit at the departmental and institutional level.Dr. Arnold Demainhas published extensively on enzyme fermentations, mutational biosynthesis, bioconversions, and metabolic regulation of primary and secondary metabolism. His success is evident in a long list of publications (over 530), 14 books of which he is co-editor or co-author, and 21 U.S. patents. His ability to \"hybridize\" basic studies and industrial applications was recognized by his election to the presidency of the Society for Industrial Microbiology in 1990, membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1994, the Mexican Academy of Sciences in 1997, and in the Hungarian Academy of Science in 2002. In recognition of his outstanding contribution to our current understanding in fermentation microbiology and biotechnology, he has been awarded honorary doctorates from a number of universities.Dr. Anthony (Tony) R. Allmanbegan his career at Glaxo, where he spent six years carrying out research into the development of subunit bacterial vaccines. During that time, he became acquainted with fermenters and their applications. Subsequently, he acted as a specialist in this area for the U.K. agent of a major European fermenter manufacturer. When Infors U.K. was established in 1987, Tony joined the new company as Product Manager (later Technical Director) and in 2002, he became Fermentation Product Manager for the Swiss parent company, Infors AG. His work involves providing technical support, training, and application expertise in-house and throughout the world.Dr. Boutaib Dahhouaddresses various issues of supervision, control, and modeling of linear and nonlinear systems. Currently, the detection and isolation of faults in the dynamic of nonlinear systems is of particular interest. Dr. Dahhou developed new algorithms on the basis of the adaptive observers that made possible the instantaneous detection of any fault. The isolation of these faults demand much time because of the procedure of parameter adaptation. To resolve this problem, he is currently developing a new approach of isolation that is based on the parameter intervals. Dr. Dahhou has successfully supervised 18 PhD students and published more than 72 articles in international journals and 130 communications in international congresses.Dr. Sergio Sanchezhas published extensively as a professor of industrial microbiology. He has made important discoveries in several areas, including research on the interrelation between the role of glutathione and the amino acid transport systems and the production of penicillin inPenicillium chrysogenum. He also explored the regulatory relationships between primary and secondary metabolism inStreptomyces peucetiusvar. caesius; he was the first to show that in addition toGlk, an adjacent gene (sco2127) participates in the process of carbon catabolite repression in this organism. Currently, he is an editor on the editorial board ofApplied Microbiology and Biotechnologyand the Editor-in-Chief ofBioTecnología, an international journal published by the Mexican Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering.", "related": [], "rank": 2823318, "title": "C.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B0083ZY6AO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Turning instead to a life of poetry and prose he eventually migrated north to the University of Montana (the Berkeley of the Rockies) and became the Redneck Granola. Falling in love with a chainsaw wielding mountain woman forced him to reconsider his chosen career path--Hemingway on a sailboat. Instead he illuminated the path of life to college students as a spiritual guide for over a dozen years while his wife (now a pharmacist) squirreled away enough acorns for David to embrace the sultry world of commercial fiction. After legally snatching a little Vietnamese boy and creating another son via more natural means the happy family settled in Idaho. David still rides horses, but only in black and never for fun.

Edward Trapp, the seaman who sees the chaos of WWII as an opportunity for his own commercial gain. Supposedly narrated by crewmember Naval Liaison Officer Miller, the novel's uneven lurching matches the journey of Trapp's derelict ship, theCharon II. From Callison's highly idiosyncratic style (filled with countless asides, aborted words and mind-numbing nautical details) a story eventually emerges, concerning the bombings of other ships in Trapp's convoy and dysfunctional interactions among Trapp and his crew. Late into the novel Trapp's plan becomes clear: he had only joined the British convoy in order to protect his ship as he pursued his real goal-reaching a remote spot near the Arctic Circle where a ship filled with gold has allegedly been trapped in ice. Visions of the gold fill Trapp's greedy soul. Given the farcical nature of the story, the ending is hardly a surprise, but most readers won't persevere that far. This novel is neither military history nor a thriller, nor even good fantasy, but more an exercise in bizarre style couched in feeble and inappropriate attempts at humor.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

David Wright finished 3rd Grade at Holliday Creek School in June 1952. He was enrolled in Butler School in Fort Dodge that September eventually graduating from Fort Dodge High in 1960. He majored in English, but he had a strong background in social studies. He earned his B.S. degree from Drake University in 1966. He taught at East High in Des Moines (1966-1972). During this time he earned an M.A. in English, again from Drake. He married Polly Kaderabek in 1968 and their first daughter Wendy was born a year later. The family moved to the Phoenix area where he took a job teaching Social Studies at Coronado High in Scottsdale. Their second daughter Sarah was born in Scottsdale in1974. During his tenure at Coronado, he gained professional notoriety as an innovator creating a program called Livengood. He promoted his ideas appearing as a \"break out speaker\" at various teacher conferences. He was contacted by the National Association of Secondary School Principals who requested that he explain his ideas about \"curriculum integration. The result was Livengood: A Community Simulation Approach to Integrative Education that appeared in their newsletter in January 1997. The NASSP article told how the disciplines of English, economics, math, are unified in a single program. The article showed how student empowerment and role playing work together in a project-driven curriculum. His article appeared again as the lead article in Education Digest, March 1997. The program also earned a large grant from INTEL Corp. in a competition for innovative contributions to education. Curriculum Integration almost caught on in America, but innovation caused a stir in Scottsdale and reactionary forces quashed the program. The same tide swept No Child Left Behind into power and curriculum integration went out the door.

When I say fly I mean run around pretending I was in a space ship. Me and my friends used to take wooden rulers and paint and draw elaborate controls on them and these were our joysticks. We had X-wing fighters and USS star ships and we would spend hours exploring alien worlds and getting into dog fights. The good guys always won. When I got a bit older I started to absorb everything I could about vampires, going through my own goth and vampire stage. I loved how cool they were and how they were sort of like super beings or demi-gods. Not even werewolves could outfox vampires. These mysterious blood suckers were lurking around every dark corner of night, just waiting to pounce on unsuspecting victims. And so now I write both science fiction and vampire horror stories because I still can't control my active imagination. I hope you enjoy my humble offerings.

He entered the below-minimum-wage fringes of the economy as a soda jerk, pin-setter and office boy before beginning his journey toward the middle class as a blue-collar machinist. He entered the Air Force during the Korean War, became a jet fighter pilot at age 20, and served his country during the Cold War. He earned his BS in Physics at Ohio State and his research at Hughes Research Labs made major contributions to ion engine space propulsion, and to the ion implantation process that is used in fabricating virtually every semiconductor chip. He entered publishing as an editor, and then held 16 different titles with Cahners Publishing, becoming its first Marketing VP and the Division Manager of its largest division where he brought record profits to the company and found himself on the bottom rungs of the 1%. While living the American Dream he never forgot the benefits his country provided that enabled his success, or the importance of a level playing field where we can utilize our total population’s talent rather than enriching a favored few that possesses no greater inherent value. He views our situation regarding today’s economic inequality as analogous to where we once stood regarding cigarette smoking, and where we presently stand with global warming. Though anyone can see the dangers, powerful economic interests will systematically obfuscate recognition of the problem, then delay implementation of corrective methods, because there is obscene money to be made for  a greedy, sociopathic few by throwing America, along with all of humanity, under the bus. An old saying goes, “Your worst enemies are usually internal.” Steve believes we are overdue to purge the cancer of inequality and end its threat to all of us.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00B1SWXP0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a crime story whose protagonist and romantic hero is a hitman or \"bumper\"he is called \"Paradise Man\" because he sends people into the next worldwho dresses like a dandy and yearns for his lost love. Paradise Man, aka The Frog, aka Holden, works for the Aladdin Fur Company in Manhattan, making sure bills are paid and guarding the company's patterns. Holden gets into trouble when he does a freelance job for La Familia, a group of powerful Cuban criminals at war with the Bandidosstet, more recent emigres from Castro's jails. He kills two con artists ripping off La Familia but, disobeying orders to leave no witnesses, does not harm the little girl he finds with them, taking her instead to be cared for by a friend. He then becomes the object of a series of murder attempts throughout New York City. Furriers, restaurateurs, lawyers and the Queens D.A. are, here, no better than Holden, who at least has a code of honor and a gentle nature. This is a convoluted tale in both narrative and moral terms, and a fascinating one.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00BX8U4YU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As her short story readers read and realize the depth of the longer stories and then get introduced to her books she hopes they come to love the characters she has developed.

That way, they are preserved for all time.  She is ALL of her characters and yet, NONE of them.  The feedback she has gotten from her readers is amazing, the vested interest in the stories and books, she doesn’t think anyone can NOT love hearing how a story made them laugh, cry, and fall in love, how they felt a similarity in their own lives, how they relate.

We remember them all of our lives.  \"Charlie the Tree\" was my favorite childhood tale.  Each year at the beginning of the Christmas season, my mother would tell Charlie’s story.  It was a tradition.The story always seemed new and exciting.   How young Charlie grew up in the forest surrounded by his friends.  How he heard of New York City and the greatest tree in the world.  How he always grew straight to the sun and truly believed that one day he would be the N.Y.C. holiday tree.I remember getting so excited when I finally heard the outcome.  It’s like it was yesterday.  The version I was told was brief and took a few minutes of my mother’s time to tell.  However, the idea and the underlying message were so alluring to me as a child that they were never to be forgotten.After I graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder, I began my career as technical architect for a Big 6 consulting firm in New York City. One day during the holiday festival season, I was walking down 5th Avenue near 50th street with a group of co-workers.  I turned to them and blurted out, \"Let’s go see Charlie.\"  They looked at me with puzzled expressions.  They had no idea what I was talking about.  I quickly recounted the story of \"Charlie The Tree\" and I could see by the expressions on their faces that they loved it!  When they began referring to the huge Norway spruce as \"Charlie\", I realized the true power of the tale!  I felt compelled to write the book and share it with young readers.The messages of this story are poignant.  It appeals to children of all ages, 4  to 104!  I hope you enjoy \"Charlie The Tree\" as much as I do.  Thanks mom.*Always believe in yourself.\"Realize your dream can be so,Reach for the stars and never let go!\"", "related": ["B00A79U5NG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My Children's books are written\nabout things which children will readily relate to, such as friendship,\nloneliness, feeling unloved or unwanted. But my adventures are exciting\nand interesting. I also produce all my own illustrations (with one or\ntwo exceptions) through a technique involving photographing toys as\nmodels and matting them against a photograph of a background that I have\n taken myself and then converted using special software into the style I\n desire. I also produce all my own covers using similar techniques. My\nPoetry is accessible, interesting, unpretentious and poignant. My YA\nnovels are thoughtful, timely and exciting for young people to read. My\nshort stories are engaging and unique. I have put a lot of myself into\nmy work and invested many hours drafting, re-drafting, proofing, editing\n and finally producing each book. It is a labor of love.

I live in Bucharest now (some call it the little Paris), and paradoxically enough, I live in an apartment where a well-known Romanian writer also lived.

This has been followed by Blood Diamonds Conspiracy; Driven By Lust; Baring Her Soul and From Serbia with Love. I refuse to be constrained by genres as you will see. See details on my website above. Readers have commented that my writing is controversial, compelling, descriptive and evocative, and they become involved with the characters. What more could a writer ask for? I am unable to restrain myself from becoming emotionally involved in humanitarian issues, as well as with my clients, readers and it comes through in my stories. I currently live in my hometown in Auckland, New Zealand and love to travel to other countries and have been to Europe many times, as my very talented partner Harald,who designs my covers,is from Germany. This has given me the opportunity to fall in love with historical landscapes and their cultures, and also indulge in three of my passions, good food, wine and great conversation. I have gleaned many ideas and settings for my stories by traveling to well known cities in Europe, and also through the small villages, each with their own special story, which have enabled me to create believable and sympathetic characters. Currently I teach English to Muslim immigrants from Iraq. Both of these experiences were so enlightening, giving me an insight into the spirit and courage these people, whom I admire tremendously and respect, portray in their everyday lives.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

He’s bright and affable visiting his San Francisco–chic former lover, who has quit her day job, thanks to a phone app she wrote. But the $100 she gives him sends him right back to the Hawse Hole, a Tenderloin dive, where he drinks himself into oblivion doing mental arithmetic to estimate how long his money will last. A botched mugging tosses him in the path of Marci, another sexy, San Francisco–chic app shark who is obsessed with the big score and happy to make Klinger the fall guy. Nisbet, who has a cult following (Windward Passage, 2010), alludes insightfully to the dualities of America’s favorite city. Fortyish, homeless, alcoholic petty criminals colliding with well-educated, well-off, amoral, twentysomething grifters doesn’t completely strain credulity. The Hawse Hole and its regulars are fascinating. But occasionally Nisbet’s rhetorical flights, which begin thoughtfully and gracefully, go on too long and begin to seem like bafflegab. --Thomas Gaughan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father sent him to a good school when he was young, and he received spiritual formation from the Jesuits. After a disturbing spiritual fear of being condemned, he eventually resolved his problem and decided to dedicate his life to God in 1587. He became a doctor of law at the age of 24 at the Jesuit College of Clermont, Paris, and was ordained a priest by Bishop Claude de Granier and stationed in Geneva in 1593.  He became bishop of Geneva in 1602.Francis de Sales is the author of various collections of sermons on Mary, Lent, prayer and Christmastide, as well as a work entitledSet Your Heart Free, edited by John Kirvan. He was known as a spiritually understanding man as well as a friend of the poor. Though known for his great intellect and theological wisdom, he spoke with simplicity and earnestness, so that all could understand.An Introduction to the Devout Life, his best-loved work, is based on notes he wrote for a cousin for marriage, stressing that sanctity is possible in everyday life. He died in 1622 on December 28, and was canonized by Pope Alexander VII in 1665. His feast is celebrated on January 24.", "related": ["B0058I73Y0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is genuinely and uniquely bi-national in its approach. The co-authored essays provide insight into the complex issues in Soviet-American relations, and the documents are well-chosen. Especially valuable are those documents from the Soviet side, which help immensely in understanding Moscow's strategic concerns and objectives. (Gary R. Hess)Based on recently released Soviet as well as American documentation,Debating the Origins of the Cold Waris an excellent introduction to a contentious subject, filled with fresh insights and sure to be of interest both to first-time students and to experienced historians. (Gaddis, John Lewis)A very useful book. (Political Studies Review)Combining American and Russian scholarship in each essay, this unique approach provides an insightful and intriguing look at American and Soviet perceptions by using a framework of combinations. Through both perspectives, the authors create a balanced, thorough, and thoughtful synthesis that offers students a clear and concise picture of the various factors that contributed to the beginning of this long, odd, and potentially catastrophic conflict. (The History Teacher)Debating the Origins of the Cold Waris a highly original synthesis of recent discoveries and scholarship. The book casts new light on Stalin's motivations and strategies, and examines the early Cold War through the eyes of both Western and Soviet leaders.Debating the Origins of the Cold Warwill be useful to instructors teaching this controversial and important subject.

At the age of 22, Isis experienced a profound event that radically altered the course of her life.  Held imprisoned for a period of several months, she escaped what is often described by human trafficking survivors as a fate worse than death. The next fifteen years were devoted to regaining her psychological and physical well-being, which marked the beginning of an intense inner personal journey leading her to experience a series of profound spiritual awakenings. She imparts timeless wisdom out of a deep, compassionate desire that all beings be released from suffering and enslavement to encounter peace in her lifetime.  Her insightful, positive, universal wisdom have empowered people around the world to experience spontaneous spiritual awakenings resulting in overwhelming bliss & joy.  Isis is unique in that she comes from no lineage, has studied under no gurus but the realms of light and follows no religious path. Her mystic wisdom comes directly from the Infinite. Isis’ programs include her mystery school called The Sacred Living Center where she offers lectures, teachings, guided meditations, wisdom and spreading the gift of Divine Light Awakenings that empower her students to encounter the Grace of Enlightenment.  Isis calls her teachings the simple art of Sacred Living through DeLight. She teaches reality creation, manifestation, living a sacred life and the Tantra of Divine Light. She encourages all who comes to her to focus on the light within themselves in order they might directly encounter their own divine and sacred nature. At the core of her teachings we find a simple philosophy that triggers a collective unfolding of enlightenment, a spiritual awakening, and a shared expression of hope and delight that she envisions as being the foundation for the future of humanity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of the 10 outstanding stories in this collection from French author Halter, the first English-language edition of his work, center on an impossible crime, a still potent subgenre that was once a fixture of last century's golden age of detective fiction. Halter sets up puzzles for his sleuths that appear to defy any rational explanation and then provides logical and satisfying solutions that few, if any, readers will anticipate. John Dickson Carr fans should be particularly impressed by the variations Halter plays on the no-footprint-in-the-snow-near-the-corpse premise, especially with The Abominable Snowman, in which witnesses see a snowman come toÂ life and stab a man to death. Readers intrigued by such situations as how bodies in a locked vault could move around or how three people could be shot to death in a sealed escalator with no one nearby, will relish these tales. One hopes that Halter's impossible crime novels will soon be made available in English as well.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her professional career began with the Korea Development Institute in Seoul. During her more than thirty-year career, she worked with a number of international aid agencies, including United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). More than half of that time was with UNICEF in several different positions. She lived in eight cities in six countries-Bangladesh, France, India, Korea, Thailand, and the US-and visited more than 80 countries. Throughout her years living, working, and traveling around the world, she encountered many interesting and challenging situations and met all sorts of memorable people. Her first-hand experiences are told in 83 short stories, which illuminate what it's like to live and work outside your own culture. They also show how resilient people are even under dire living conditions.

He's losing hope for her recovery until her\ndoctor mentions a miracle cure that was once on the horizon but suddenly\ndisappeared without a trace. Putting his investigative skills to work, Enzo\nlocates Megan and Dr. Novak, and he's quickly pulled into their desperate\nplight when he understands the implications and impact of Novak's discovery.\nLee does everything he can to bring their story to light, despite the odds;\nmeanwhile, Merrick & Merrick will stop at nothing to prevent Dr. Novak from\nrevealing his world-altering secret.Lowe brings back the likable, persistent\nEnzo Lee in this third novel. At the outset, Enzo is reporting light fluff\npieces and still reeling from a journalistic debacle--but he appealingly steps\nup when the going gets tough. Lowe portrays Megan as wise beyond her years, a\ntrusting child who never appears naïve. Another supporting character, Detective\nBobbie Connors, is also a solid asset to the story. The novel quickly\nintroduces multiple storylines and characters, and as a result, it takes a\nwhile for the plot to truly kick in and gain traction. However, Lowe soon\nmerges his various elements to deliver a story that moves forward with solid\nassurance. -Kirkus Reviews, March 8, 2014", "related": ["B00DDU756Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 66.0}

The ancient healing exercises he shares from decades of experience are presented in a format that is easy to understand, learn, and practice. Having worked with some of these exercises I can personally say they cultivate more peace, calm, and body awareness. This is a book I will be recommending to many of my clients for years to come!”—Tahir Bhatti, MD, wellness physician, director of Integrative Holistic Services, and associate clinical professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, San Diego “In a world where everyone experiences stress and worry, what a gift it is to readThe Qigong Workbook for Anxiety. Master Kam Chuen Lam introduces readers to the ancient tradition of qigong in a friendly and accessible way. He teaches simple yet potent methods for relaxing both physical and emotional tension. His instructions are revolutionary in that he encourages us not to reject feelings of anxiety. Instead, by practicing these qigong exercises we become aware of our greater energy field and learn how to regulate our nervous system even when tension arises. This book is for anyone who wants to tap into their inner strength and live a calmer, healthier life.”—Amy Conway, MPH, senior managerial consultant for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California“Having worked for over thirty years in a busy and demanding dental practice, I am no stranger to stress at work. I can, without hesitation, attribute my current well\\x1ebeing largely to my daily practice and enjoyment of qigong. Being calm as a practitioner, I am able to bring harmony to the way I run my practice and patients enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. I strongly believe that Master Kam Chuen Lam’s unique lineage, wisdom, and extensive knowledge [make this book] a must\\x1ehave for all busy and stressed professionals who also want to remain truly healthy whilst having to endure daily challenges at work and home.”—Thye Yeoh, qigong student and dental practitioner in the UK“Do not let the simplicity of the exercises in this book fool you. ... I work as the compliance director of a major financial firm in London—a highly stressful job—and I can vouch from my own experience for the profundity of these exercises and the enormous wisdom of Master Kam Chuen Lam’s teaching.”—Charles Beck, qigong student and director of compliance, London, UK“Anxiety is part of the ‘broken brain’ syndrome that millions of Americans suffer from. Conventional medicine can mask the symptoms, but it doesn’t tackle the root cause. That’s what the total mind\\x1ebody system of qigong does. In this groundbreaking workbook, Master Kam Chuen Lam shows us how to use our own life\\x1eforce energy to lift our minds and bodies to a new level of wellness. Open this book to any page and you’ll find it’s one of the most practical, helpful, and friendly guidebooks to your own well\\x1ebeing you can imagine.”—Mark Hyman, MD, author of the #1New York Timesbestseller,The Blood Sugar Solution“True health is more than exercise and good nutrition. It includes peace of mind. Those who possess it glow and seem to have access to a wellspring of pure energy. If you’ve ever wondered how to become such a person, qigong Master Kam Chuen Lam can guide you there.”—Susan Piver, founder of the Open Heart Project\n“Qigong combines two approaches to treating anxiety that are known to work: exercise and mindfulness. This highly accessible and readable workbook should help many more people enjoy the benefits of qigong.” —Elizabeth Murray, general practitioner and professor of emergency health and primary care at the University of London, UK“This book comes at the right time. More than ever, employees and managers are struggling to keep up with the ever\\x1eincreasing speed and constantly rising demands of business life. The ensuing stress and burnout is literally killing people. Western approaches to dealing with the resulting issues have reached their limits. Master Kam Chuen Lam’s workbook is addressing the root cause—anxiety—in a new way. It is based on age\\x1eold Chinese wisdom and Lam’s own life’s work devoted to the study of human energy. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to be successful in the long run.”—Thomas Apfel, corporate account manager at IBM“Master Kam Chuen Lam’s new book about dealing with anxiety is a revelation on its own. During my daily interaction with dental patients, I come across a big percentage of anxiety cases. I have been aiming to incorporate Master Kam Chuen Lam’s relaxation techniques during treatment. As a result, patients often relax so much that they’re telling us when they get off the dental chair that they feel as if they had a good rest! It is without a doubt, that in this book, various daily issues are addressed in an effective manner. Conventional Western medicine has no ammunition to combat stress or anxiety for everyday life or work. Look no further, Master Kam Chuen Lam’s new book provides you with the essential elements to survive today’s hectic lifestyle and emerge unscathed with simple techniques. It’s the first time I’ve come across such an informative and to\\x1ethe\\x1epoint read. … It is a beacon of hope in today’s jungle.”—Maria Maliderou, DDS, MSc, qigong student and dentist based in London, UK", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
