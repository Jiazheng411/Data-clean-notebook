Though none of his ideas are new, Davis presents them with a winning blend of warmth and affability. While he does not work with his titular metaphor until the end of the book, Davis deals with topics such as suffering, loss and disappointment throughout, peppering the book with anecdotes (and miracles) from his own life as well as the lives of friends, celebrities and people to whom he has ministered. In particular, Davis refers repeatedly to his own son's deafness, and as he tells stories about this situation, he displays a refreshing combination of honesty, humility, optimism and faith. This attitude toward his own pain not only strengthens his credibility as an adviser to the suffering but also sets the book apart; unlike most authors who tackle these topics, Davis yields a book infused with lightness that does not actually make light of the serious topics it covers. As an evangelical Christian, Davis performs a difficult balancing act: He refers more than once to the uniqueness of Christ, but also encourages people of all faiths to look to their own religions for solace and moral guidance. Evangelical readers may judge this an unacceptable compromise, but Davis's wider audience will undoubtedly appreciate the gesture.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Meaning of Video Games draws on the methods of textual studies and on a solid understanding of games and how they are played. It is an enjoyable, edifying, next-generation book.\"-Nick Montfort, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\"In The Meaning of Video Games Steven E. Jones makes it look easy, effortlessly dissolving distinctions between media studies, game studies, and textual studies. Close readings become 'close playings' (and back again) as the book creates an interdisciplinary convergence culture every bit as mobile and networked as the objects of its study.\"-Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, University of Maryland\"This is a perfect case of a book hitting the market exactly when we need it. While there have been individual academic accounts of specific types and modes of games before, Jones's book is the first scholarly (and 'popular') study of an increasingly pervasive element of contemporary culture, deftly integrating the phenomenology of game design and game playing with the general textuality in which Jones wisely chooses to discuss both the creation and reception of gaming. Avoiding the pitfalls of a straight historical narrative, the author selects certain emblematic moments in the growth of games and games studies (from Lost to Halo to the Wii-and 'platform studies' -to the forthcoming Spore). He sets these exempla against a wide array of other disciplines and approaches: media studies, psychology, textual studies, popular culture, sociology, anthropology, and even 'literature.' Whether Jones has provided the last word on the 'meaning' of video games remains to be seen, but it will certainly inspire others to continue the search for such 'meaning.'\"-David Greetham, City University of New York\"The meaning of video games - suggests Jones - is not intrinsic to the text, but is produced dynamically from the interaction between author and user, code and system, machine and human being. The pleasant digressions on otaku culture, reality TV shows and TV series such as Lost (which opens the volume) make reading The Meaning of Video Games pleasant, if not essential.\"- Matteo Bittanti, Videoludica\"As his title promises, Jones successfully demonstrates strategies for understanding the meanings of video games. His six case studies present insightful analyses and exemplify how scholars might approach games using textual studies theories...Jones provides another fruitful contribution to the interdisciplinary network of game studies, offering close textual readings of specific game artifacts to illuminate how video games are the \"quintessential social texts of our present cultural moment.\"\"-Cinema Journal Spring 2009 Issue \"Ultimately, Jones’ contributions in this excellent collection of more or less stand-alone chapters sums up with a wonderful exposition of the ceaseless movement of significance in the paratextual character of the human engagement with videogames.\"-New Media and Society 2009; 11; 641", "related": [], "rank": 1496978, "title": "The Meaning of Video Games: Gaming and Textual Strategies", "author": "Steven E.

Wondering if theColumbiatragedy might have triggered a post-traumatic stress reaction (Daniel and Claire's father died of a heart attack shortly after the 1986Challengerdisaster), Claire leaves the U.K. for Miami, where she hopes to find some answers. She gets some sleuthing advice from Huey, a down-on-his-luck actor, and Huey's goofy boa constrictor–loving girlfriend. While a subplot in which Huey plots revenge against real-life producer Harvey Weinstein, whom the actor blames for his sagging career, is funny, it's so strained that it blurs the focus on an otherwise lovely contemplation about recovering from the black holes in every family's life. Wener (The Perfect Play) is the former lead singer of the British pop band Sleeper.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His book is a long-needed contribution of a serious scholar to an ongoing academic debate, in which the Hebron Jews were left without a decisive, unapologetic, systematically argued voice.(Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal Of Jewish Studies)It has been said that historians are more powerful than the gods because the latter cannot change history. But American historian Jerold S. Auerbach has done something even more powerful; he has demonstrated a clairvoyance which is quite astonishing in a book that he began researching years ago.Hebron Jews...while focusing initially on the coordinates of Hebron from the Biblical era to yesterday opens up a broad and stimulating inquiry on the settler movement in general and its reverberations on the chasm between the right and the left in the current Israeli political spectrum. It is a tribute to the author's competence in matters historical....In this lively literary pilgrimage Auerbach shows what many have forgotten — that Hebron was a vital Jewish centre comparable even to Jerusalem....Auerbach's book is a model of disinterested research which, through the alchemical process of fine writing and passionate advocacy of the truth, delivers a highly readable sage about the travail of modern Zionism. (Chicago Jewish Star)Auerbach deftly develops the history of Hebron and examines the motivations of settlers who choose to live there. The reader comes away understanding how significant elements of a peace process that are bandied about as feasible, such as resigning all of Hebron to the Palestinians, impacts on real people with serious historical and political arguments. (Jewish Book World)Broad and stimulating.... Intriguing and revalatory.... Auerbach's book is a model of disinterested research which, through the alchemical process of fine writing and passionate advocacy of the truth, delivers a highly readable saga about the travail of modern Zionism. (Dr. Arnold AgesMidstream)This lyrical, passionate, and engaged volume should be required reading for anyone who seeks to understand the Jews of Hebron on their own terms. Absorbing, sometimes infuriating, and always informative. (Jonathan D. Sarna, Brandeis University)Auerbach cuts through reams of distortion and misrepresentation to provide an indispensable account of Jews in Hebron from the time of biblical Abraham to the contentious present. Scrupulously researched, the book illumes the contemporary Middle East and the workings of collective memory, all the while engaging the casual reader who is looking for a riveting story. (Ruth Wisse, Harvard University)A fine, original piece of work, thoroughly researched and beautifully organized. Like Auerbach's earlier books, this one is solidly and intelligently documented, and handsomely written, in a prose style that is lucid, vigorous, and graceful. Auerbach is perambulating a land mine, confronting liberal dogmatisms of the most ferocious kind. Yet he has maintained a delicate balance between his sympathies and his principle of scholarly disinterestedness; to put it another way, he is able to show that good causes sometimes attract bad advocates. Another kind of balance he achieves is to consider simultaneously the Arab-Jewish struggle over Hebron and the religious Zionist-secular Zionist struggle over Hebron. This is an important book, a history at once sympathetic and dispassionate.

As they take part in the spooky evening tour of the house, Lila senses and sees what Gabe thinks are all gimmicks and Disney-style special effects. The presence of spirits is strong and one in particular is reaching out to Lila. It is the spirit of Daphne, a slave girl who was accused of poisoning her master's wife and two daughters. Is Lila the one who can put things right for Daphne after all these years and allow peace to come to Laurel Oaks? This plot-twisting ghost story is full of history, friendship, romance, betrayal, and jealousy. Lila's and Daphne's stories are revealed through alternating chapters, shifting between today and the 1840s. While this technique works well, at times it is distracting and seems to make the plot drag needlessly. Overall, this is an interesting read with considerable potential but its ending loses steam.—Donna Rosenblum, Floral Park Memorial High School, NYCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It seemed logical since our state (Florida) is known as \"the sunshine state\" and so the project began. Over the years, I squirreled away trivial bits of information others used in creating such a device but nowhere did I find all of these thoughts put into one design - until now.The original design used convection and no moving parts but being in the sunshine state I found that the collector got very, very hot and convection could not transfer the heat fast enough into the hot water heater. A revision in the second edition addressed this dilemma (a great problem to have - too much sun!) and with this addition I now enjoy essentially free hot water.This guide helps you plan for more than just harvesting heat from the sun to heat your water, it shows how you can use your existing hot water heater to do this and can save you the cost of buying a solar-rated hot water heater.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not knowing where the story or the characters might be going, I slowly churned out a chapter here and there. A few chapters and a couple months into it the idea for the New Dawn, a secret Oxford society, formed. Like the proverbial light bulb going on I understood the characters and their mission in life. Everything fit together.I wrote the first draft in about ten months. After feedback from critique friends and my inner-critiquer, I reworked and rewrote 5 or 6 more times before I thought it was acceptable. A few more rewrites and I started thinking \"this is pretty darn good.\" I still remember the time I read through the last several chapters without slowing down. Obviously, I knew the plot and the characters intimately. Evenso I found myself caught up in the story and the lives of those involved.Cheers!", "related": [], "rank": 1941511, "title": "The Father's Child", "author": "Mark Adair", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.625, "rating_total": 29.0}

As the population of the fledgling U.S. grew, so too did pressure on the Cherokees to quit their land. Foremost among the advocates of Cherokee removal was Andrew Jackson, who used every power at his command--including eventually the power of the presidency--to see Cherokee land settled by whites. Against this formidable foe stood an unlikely champion, trading post owner John Ross. Only a fraction Cherokee, Ross nevertheless felt a powerful connection to the people and their cause, journeying repeatedly to Washington to plead their case and gain some sort of protection from the depredations of settlers and overzealous politicians. Ultimately defeated, he turned to doing what he could to ease the brutality of the long, bitter, and--for many thousands of Cherokee--fatal march on foot into the West along what came to be called the Trail of Tears. Richly detailed and well-researched, the heartbreaking history unfolds like a political thriller with a deeply human side. (Jan.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Rasell has a formidable command of Scripture, and in the course of this relatively brief but extensively researched book, a great many other topics of exegesis are presented, from the nature of the obedience the Hebrew prophets showed God to the details of crucifixion as practiced by the Romans to the uses and abuses of angelology. But book’s main aim—and the bulk of its teaching—centers on the scriptural basis for the Adventist belief in the temple of heaven. Rasell explains that it derives mainly from the book of Hebrews, in which the temple is described as not of human creation and “therefore superior to anything man has ever made or can conceive of,” a kind of divine tabernacle in which Jesus as high priest works on behalf of his believers in an analogous manner to the way human priests receive the confessions of sinners and offer redemption. Rasell stresses the importance of this intercessory aspect in Adventist faith. “We need to learn that there is no merit in repeated penances or pilgrimages,” he writes, “man only needs the all sufficient sacrifice of Christ.” The special nature of the Adventist worldview is spelled out as a gentle rejection of worldly indulgences: “[W]e are called upon to be sober and to restrain our appetites.” Rasell writes of all this in clear, accessible language, and although his scriptural analysis can be extensive, general readers will be able to follow along with ease.An extremely thorough, engaging presentation of the framework of Seventh-day Adventist beliefs.", "related": ["B005BFIC9K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is most notable for his Catholic faith, which had a strong impact on most of his works and his writing collaboration with G. K. Chesterton. Belloc wrote on myriad subjects, from warfare to poetry to the many current topics of his day. He has been called one of the Big Four of Edwardian Letters, along with H.G.Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and G. K. Chesterton, all of whom debated each other into the 1930s. Belloc was closely associated with Chesterton, and Shaw coined the term Chesterbelloc for their partnership. Asked once why he wrote so much,] he responded, \"Because my children are howling for pearls and caviar.\" Belloc observed that \"The first job of letters is to get a canon,\" that is, to identify those works which a writer looks upon as exemplary of the best of prose and verse. For his own prose style, he claimed to aspire to be as clear and concise as \"Mary had a little lamb.\" His best travel writing has secured a permanent following.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From Lebanon to Egypt, Iraq to Pakistan, India to China, Elie strays from his orthodox ways, settles in Shanghai, builds a lucrative business and lives in grandeur while Jews fleeing Hitler's ovens live in squalor on the darker side of Shanghai. History and wars take a toll, rendering him a man without a country, affecting both his fate and the decisions he must make to survive. --5 Towns Jewish TimesThis moving story resonates from the heart. It cannot be easy to lay out everything so unafraid. Syrians reluctantly tell stories about themselves that are difficult and painful. Elie Sutton's vivid descriptions of events, places, and human relationships will stir your emotions and take you to a place of reality in your own life. This book will be read many times over. --Dibo Attar, financierA powerful story of struggle, loyalty, faith and love, deftly chronicled with the sensitivity only an immensely gifted writer can convey. Anyone who cares about Jewish history as it evolved in the Middle East and America in the 20th century will find this book hard to put down. Readers will come to know and admire Elie Sutton through this compelling and candid narrative. -- Marshall Frank, authorThe story of Elie Sutton begins in Aleppo, Syria in the 1920s and reveals the ultimate sacrifices made by his family to survive the violent anti-Semitism sweeping through the Arab world. Elie's journey to maturity begins at age 20 when he must abandon his dream of becoming a doctor and adjust to life without his family. Alone in Shanghai, China, he pursues a life of success until politics and world events wreak havoc on him and render him a man without a country. While relying solely on himself and some of his contacts for survival, he is plagued with anxiety about his family's well being in Syria and the lack of communications to reach them. Weaving history with the Sutton family's personal saga makes this book an emotional and educational must read. --Rachelle Matsas, Image Magazine", "related": [], "rank": 1572288, "title": "Alien at Home", "author": "Bahia Abrams", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The action is balanced with generous doses of suspense, but the book is more than a thriller with a large cast of well-developed and interesting characters. It is a beautifully told, almost poetic, story of fear, loss, love, friendship, sin and redemption. There are passages of deep psychological and philosophic insight. Add lyric depictions of falconry and some of the loveliest and most majestic parts of the United States and Ireland and you have a wonderful book that transcends genres.\"Lee Holz   Goodreads ReviewerThis book is brilliantly written in so many aspects. It gives the reader a history of the Irish struggles without being didactic. The book has a wonderful description of the West of Ireland-- it is so well done that --it plants a thirst for wanting to visit. Falconry is so out of my frame of reference that I was surprised to be absolutely enthralled by the sport or rather, I should say, the art of it. The characters are so well crafted that they become everything you expect them to be--earthy, intense, colorful or sinister--the way the author portrays each of them you feel the love or hate as the intricacies of their lives are woven throughout the story. It is completely obvious that Maurice knows his way around weapons, the Middle East, Ireland's countryside and history, falconry and the house he describes so vividly. This book is everything you could want in a book--and the suspense, mystery, and drama make it a nail-biter and page turner. If it is ever made into a movie,(and it should be) I'll be first in line to see it! Out of 5 stars, I give it a ten!Marilyn Brand, Cinncinnati Ohio.", "related": ["B0073XV1XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

I completed theological studies with Liberty University in 1996. I formerly served as editor and forum moderator of Thyroid Health for a major multi-topic content site and as a general health writer for another, where I received Editor's Choice Awards for my articles on health subjects.    In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.    My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003. I now enjoy sharing this information with other patients experiencing my same health disorders.   During the early 1990s, I marketed an outdoors product I invented and that I formed a small corporation to patent, manufacture and sell called the \"Rod Floater\" (now a registered Trademark). I traveled the U.S. making presentations to groups of Wal-Mart zone and district managers and received authorization to sell the product in two regions of Wal-Mart stores for five years.   I also sold the product to Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and Academy Stores, all of which still carry the product and I landed a national promotion for the product with Kerr-McGee Oil Company who began using the product to promote their outboard motor oil in 1992. In 1996 I licensed the product to TTI-Blakemore, a major fishing tackle conglomerate, from which I am still paid royalties from sales of the product.   I invented and marketed five additional outdoors products, also getting these into Wal-Mart stores and afterward sold them outright rather than licensing them.  I was featured in the May 2001 issue of Inventors digest magazine.", "related": [], "rank": 1913203, "title": "Difficulties in Applying for U.S. Social Security Disability: Respectful Disagreements and Suggestions for the SSDI Application Process", "author": "James Lowrance", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

M. Hargrove, realized her life was on fast forward and if she didn't do something soon, it would quickly be too late to write that work of fiction she had been dreaming of her whole life.  So, she rolled down the passenger window of her fabulous (not) company car and tossed out her leather briefcase.  Luckily, the pedestrian in the direct line of fire was a dodgeball pro and had über quick reflexes enabling him to avoid getting bashed in the head.  Feeling a tad guilty about the near miss, A. M. made a speedy turn down a deserted side street before tossing her crummy, outdated piece-of-you-know-what lap top out the window.   She breathed a liberating sigh of relief, picked up her cell phone and hit #4 on her speed dial. Boss:  Hello A.M.:  Boss, is that you? Boss:  Why yes, A. M., who else would be answering my phone? A.M.:  Er... right.  Well, I'm calling to let you know you can pick up my luxury Ford Focus at Starbucks near the interstate. Boss:  Why ever would I want to do that? A.M.:  Because I quit! A.M. hit the end button and speed dialed her husband. A.M.:  Hi hubs, can you pick me up at Starbucks? Hubs:  Sure... Having some car trouble? A.M.:  Not at all.  I don't have a car to have trouble with because I just quit my job. Hubs:  WHAT?! A.M.:  It's time for a new career and I am going to be a very famous novelist. So began A. M. Hargrove's career as a young adult paranormal romance author of self-published ebooks.  Her series, The Guardians of Vesturon, centers around a family of six siblings and is a mix of humor, mystery, suspense and of course, love.  Survival, Resurrection and Determinant are her first and second and third full length novels in the series and Beginnings is the prequel novella.

I think it would work perfectly for a read-aloud for my 1st grader. In fact, I think it will go-along great with our row ofMike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel. It will be a great way to introduce the concept of steam power and it will be a wonderful review of the countries we have studied!Delightful Learning BlogI will say that from the beginning, my 8 year old has LOVED this book. She took it with her on vacation and to her friend's house so that they could read parts of it together. She loves anything with great imagination and she was enthralled with the idea that Munford can travel all over the world and all through time as a water drop.Jenilee @ Our Goodwin Journey BlogOne of many things that I liked about the book as a homeschool mother is that that each chapter has the potential to springboard into many conversations. Possibly even unit studies. In addition to geography, there is history, science, and plenty of little tidbits of interesting information that are sure to leave an impression.Our Village Is A Little Different BlogWe began using it as a read-aloud, and found it enjoyable. It was easy to read (it's written at an elementary reading level) with short chapters, so I could fit a little in here and there for school breaks. Then I just let my children finish the book. While very simple for the older children to read, it had enough detailed and new information in it for them. They commented several times how well-written it was, and how naturally the learning was woven in to the story. The younger children were just completely captivated by the adventures of the cute little water droplet. --The Cardamoms Pod BlogThe Adventures of Munfordseries is a set of historical fiction books which view history through the eyes of a water molecule named Munford. Yes, a water molecule. This makes perfect sense since water cycles in various forms and is present in every time period. Why didn t I think of this? What a clever way to transport readers back in time. Munford brings children along on his travels, teaching geography, history, science and more.The Homeschool VillageWhen we received the set of books in the mail, McKenna walked off with the books and started reading them right away. She is currently reading the third book in the series and really enjoying them! We know she is absorbing the info, because we constantly hear about Munford during the day. --Homeschool Creations Blog", "related": [], "rank": 1654999, "title": "The Adventures of Munford: Munford Meets Robert Fulton", "author": "Jamie Aramini", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brown's writing is personal,\ninformative and funny. She includes history about each country and the\nspecific sites that she visited, which makes the places come to life for\n the reader. The same is true of her accounts of the people she\nbefriended. The stories are also revealing of Brown as a person. She\ncomes across as brave, a little impulsive, compassionate, inquisitive,\nand open-hearted. Even though most of the jobs Brown worked during her\ntravels included accommodations that many of her fellow performers\nstayed close to for security, Brown (who learned some Arabic in Egypt)\nmade a point of reaching out to the local community at every stop. Even\nthough the story is primarily about Brown's work as a professional belly\n dancer, what will keep the reader engaged is the spirit of this\nadventurous woman who seems to have few fears and sees even fewer\nlimitations in life. From Egypt to the United Arab Emirates to Ethiopia,\n Brown's courage helped her navigate many interesting situations. And\nher love for her work never faltered.Stories of a Traveling Bellydanceris a colorful, entertaining story of a young dancer with a passion for\nher work and an absolute love for adventure. It is an inspiring tale for\n the young and the old who are interested in travel and living an\nunrestricted life.

Alter, a Golden Spur winner, looks at the Custer myth from the first-person perspective of his widow, Elizabeth Bacon Custer. Libbie's narrative begins when she is 12 years old and grieving her recently deceased mother. Custer, summering with his family in Monroe, Michigan, offers some heartfelt encouragement to the young girl. Their courtship doesn't actually begin until years later when Custer has already graduated from West Point. Even then, though, Libbie must overcome the objections of her father and stepmother, who feel that being the wife of a career military man isn't fitting for the daughter of a judge. What follows is a genuinely moving love story based on three books written by the real-life Libbie, on numerous biographies of Custer, and on surviving correspondence. Life with Autie, as Libbie called Custer, was far from perfect--he was a notorious womanizer--but it was intense, exciting, and romantic. Alter stays comfortably within the formulas of the historical-romance genre, but she cares about accuracy and detail.

'Tis likely the MacLaurin chieftain you've been expecting these past days.\"\"Good. Good. Tell me when he reaches the gate,\" Laird Donald replied and watched his lieutenant depart the hall before settling on a bench at the table and taking a long pull on his ale. The MacLaurins were not well known to him. He only knew that they were a clan whose property was much further to the north than his own and whose laird was a young man of about sixteen summers.A messenger had come a sennight past with a missive from the young laird requesting an audience with him, and Laird Donald had sent word back that he would be welcomed.'Twas rumored that the MacLaurin had inherited the title at a very young age, after a bloody massacre had killed the old laird, his grandfather, as well as the lad's mother and a small number of MacLaurin warriors. He'd also heard the lad's father was behind the murders and that the lad had later killed his father and avenged their deaths.An all-too familiar scuffling sound came from the doorway leading to the kitchens. With a sigh of resignation, Laird Donald turned toward the sound, forcing a smile of good will upon his countenance. \"Ah, Cook. Is there aught amiss?\"\"Aye, Laird, and well you know its cause I'll wager. 'Tis the bairn. She wills not to know her place, laird. She's all the time lurkin' about my kitchens and gettin' underfoot as I work. 'Tis not fittin' for the lass to be runnin' 'round with the kitchen maids.\"Giving his prized cook his best look of contrition, Laird Lachlan Donald let out a loud sigh. \"'My sister swore that my daughter would quit her wild ways and settle into more ladylike behavior by her sixth summer, but clearly, 'tis not come to pass. I shall speak to the lass forthwith. She shall be banished from the kitchens.\"Maryn lay on her stomach with her cinnamon curls dancing as she wiggled and squirmed in an effort to keep her grip on her barnyard prize. The pet was her new best friend. Being the only bairn at the holding, Maryn's friends tended to be of the four-legged sort. As she held the thing more securely against her chest, her fidgety pet tickled her neck with its long, scratchy fingers. Maryn snickered, then clamped her hand over her mouth.The musical sound of his daughter's glee echoed faintly around Laird Donald. Smiling indulgently at the delightful tremolo, he looked around the hall for his wayward bairn. He'd have to chasten her for her sneakiness again, but he could not bring himself to be truly upset with her antics. For she was such a curious lass, and that was the cause of her mischief-making, he was sure. Tho' 'twas clear now that he'd need to rein her in a bit more, else his cook would surely revolt. Maryn's pet tried to leap out of her hands again. \"Nay,\" she chided in a loud whisper, \"you must not let Papa know we are here.\"\"Ah!\" Laird Donald said as he craned his neck to look under his table. \"'Tis my wayward daughter that twitters so prettily! I was sure wee brownies had invaded my fortress.\"Maryn giggled. \"Papa, you are so silly. The brownies only come out at night!\"The cook turned on her heel and stormed toward the entrance to the hall, muttering just loud enough for her laird to hear. \"The lass is bein' spoiled an' needs to be taken in hand, she does.\"Laird Donald cleared his throat, taking the not-so-subtle hint. \"Maryn, attend me now. 'Twas not good of you to eavesdrop. And stay out of Cook's kitchen.\"\"But, Papa--!\"\"Nay, heed me, daughter,\" her papa admonished. \"I know the lure of the kitchen is a great one, but Cook has little patience for wee lasses who get underfoot.\"\"But, Papa...!\" she tried again.\"Nay, lass, hear me well. She'll quit me for sure and return to her clan--your dear mother's clan--if you do not mind your papa and stay out of her way. And she is the best cook in the whole of the Highlands--'twould not please me to lose her.\"Maryn's shoulders drooped as she bowed her head in defeat. \"Aye, Papa.\" Brightening, she lifted her eyes to her papa's countenance. \"But might I help the other maids when Cook is not about?\"Her papa sighed and shook his head, giving her a lopsided smile. \"We shall see. For now, just try and stay out of the kitchen.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What the devil have you got there, lass? You're wiggling like a hooked salmon. Bring it out from under the table so I can get a good look at it, my neck's getting a crick in it.\"Maryn scooted out from her hiding place and, carefully clasping the wriggling, clammy toad in her outstretched hands, brought it up close to her father's face for his inspection. \"See Papa!\" Her papa hauled his head back. \"This be my best friend, Piddle,\" she said happily.With raised eyebrows, Laird Donald replied dubiously, \"Aye, looks like a good specimen.\"\"I found him this morn enjoying the air inside Old Elsie's bucket of oats. I was afeared she might eat him if I did not take him out right away.\" She nodded her head. \"Remember you how blind the old mare is, Papa?\"\"Aye, that I do, lass.\"\"Anyway, as soon as I grabbed him, he went pee-pee right down my arm--can you believe it? That's why I named him Piddle, 'cuz that's what he did. What think you of that?\"Laird Donald chuckled. \"I'd say that's a fitting name for him then, daughter!\"Unfortunately, the toad chose that moment to live up to his appellation once more and sent another spray of urine down his daughter's arm, and into Laird Donald's lap.\"God's teeth!\" he roared, springing from his chair with a mighty yowl, he hopped on one foot as he shook the other, causing his dripping daughter to chortle with glee.The sound of his bairn's laughter soothed his temper and he, too, began to laugh, his eyes twinkling with mirth.  Turning, he called for one of the servants to bring a damp cloth to wipe off the mess the creature had left on them.\"Daughter, you do realize that the toad must be allowed to go back to his home by the stables or he will not be happy.\" His daughter's lower lip protruded and her brows slammed together. She shook her head. As Laird Donald began washing off her arm, he explained further, \"Mayhap he has a wife and bairns waiting for him to return right this very moment.\"Maryn's grip on the creature was becoming more and more difficult to maintain as the moments passed--especially with all the washing going on. \"Aye, Papa--oops!\" The toad managed to slip from her hands and, making a loud plopping sound as it landed on the floor, instantly began hopping toward the entrance to the hall. A merry chase ensued. Laird Donald called out instructions as he raced to one side and Maryn darted to the other, each grabbing for, and missing, the bumpy, brown, and rapidly springing toad. They were both laughing and taking in great gulps of air at the folly by the time they had finally captured it.Laird Donald looked into the sparkling amber eyes of his daughter as she struggled mightily to keep her grip on her friend. Leaning down a bit, he pressed the small of her tiny back as he led her towards the door. \"Maryn, return Piddle back to his place by the stables forthwith before he either gets loose in the hall again, or begins showering us once more with his golden blessings.\"\"Aye, Papa,\" Maryn said on a sigh, and clutching her best friend to her bosom, she reluctantly walked out the door of the keep.", "related": ["B007RB318S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

His eyes narrowed and searched but he didn't see anything.Torie vied for his attention. She stood up on the couch, her crotch right in Marcus' face, and slid her shorts off. She sat back down in Marcus' lap, the warmth of her pussy pressing through her panties onto Marcus' dick. Torie leaned in and kissed him.Her kisses were deep and ravenous. Marcus struggled to catch his breath. The heat from her body turned him on so much he thought he'd exploded right there in his underwear.Torie shifted her weight and kissed up and down Marcus' neck. She reached down and massaged Marcus' meat through the fabric. Marcus took the chance to suck in some air and look back at the shadowy area. His eyes darted back and forth trying to see what was out of place. Then he saw it...a shoe that wasn't there before.The shoe looked like it could be on someone's foot. Marcus couldn't tell. The corner was too dark. He started to move but Torie pushed him back on the couch. She leaned in and sucked on his bottom lip. Then, Marcus felt his dick in a wetter, tighter grip.The moist warmth that enveloped his dick made his mind race. Torie had pulled her panties to the side and slipped him inside her. He was almost lost in the rapture but he panicked and began to pull her off. In mid motion he saw the shoe move. Someone was stepping out from the darkness.It was Terrance, Torie's twin brother.Marcus almost lost his mind seeing Terrance watching him and his sister having sex. But what he saw next unsettled and calmed Marcus all at the same time.Terrance's tall, naked frame came into the light. His pants were bunched up at his knees and his shirt was pulled over his head. He jacked his long dick, watching the two of them.Torie dropped her weight on Marcus and took him in balls deep. The hot, wet folds of her pussy forced a guttural moan from Marcus. Torie began riding him like a jockey, the whole time Marcus and Terrance's eyes were locked on each other. Marcus felt he was in a trace, watching Terrance please himself.Torie looked down at Marcus with lust and excitement in her eyes. Sweat covered her face and dripped down her neck.

Bookseller Coverley (London Writing, 2005; Occult London, 2008; Psychogeography, 2006; Utopia, 2010) invites readers on an engaging and fascinating stroll through the cultural history of walking. Presenting in chronological order a rich ensemble of writers from diverse parts of the literary spectrum, Coverley expertly demonstrates the varied representations of walkers, from pilgrim and pedestrian to tourist and wayfarer. The first chapters trace the earliest literary accounts of walking from its biblical roots in Adam and Eve’s expulsion from Eden and Abel’s nomadism to its philosophical traditions. Selected works by Virgil, Horace, and Homer exemplify the “integral role the act of walking plays in the classical canon,” as do writings from Aristotle’s Athenian school, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In succeeding chapters, Coverley critically examines the pilgrimages of Dante, Chaucer, Whitman, and Wordsworth while focusing on the central motifs of journey, opportunity, nature, and the imagination. Most compelling is the chapter devoted to the flâneur, in which the wanderings of Baudelaire (“Paris becomes a book to be read by walking her streets”) and Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway (who “positively leaps” through the streets of central London) are celebrated. Splendid, scholarly, and suffused with evocative stories and biographical sketches, Coverley’s book not only proffers pleasure and diversion but also potently explores the historical significance of the art of walking. --Miriam Tuliao", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thanks for this magnificent contribution in the form of the pattern system. It's truly amazing! ~ Jill SosnaI found this book useful, easy to follow and gentle in its approach. It has successfully avoided jargon but encouraged me instead to look for my gains, needs and fears with regards to my people-pleasing. It offers insights about why we seem so often to be stuck in unsatisfactory and repetitive behavior. It also emphasizes the means and choices for change. I liked the layout, where case examples, graphics and the workbook make for lively reading.

The way two sets of people, the\nprepared and those that have had to tough it out, deal with the\nsubsequent environment is cleverly planned and described. The writing is\n clear, and while there are some editing and grammatical issues, they\nare easily overlooked, at least by me. The climax moves well, and does\nnot follow the \"obvious\" line that only too many authors would follow,\nso top marks there. On the negative side, though, very little emotion is\n shown, and the main function of the characters is to move the plot\nforward. Characterization is through what the characters do, which is\ngood, but because the conversations are brief and most of the action is\nto progress the plot rapidly, the characters may be difficult to see.\nIndeed, one of the best-drawn characters is actually a giant wolf. To\nsummarize, an interesting read that is easily read, but not one for\nengaging with the characters.", "related": ["B008AWXLZQ"], "rank": 3818864, "title": "MuTerra eBook", "author": "R. K.

Pennington Douroreviewed by Lee Ware, The U.S. Review of Books   The Beautiful, Winged Madnessis a passionate story of love and art, illusion\nand spirit. Whisked away in a world haunted by madness both real and imagined,\nthe story is kept together by the two central characters and the bond they form\nthroughout the pages. Galloping across L.A.'s landscape, Anna and Guy push\nthemselves with a sense of artistic purpose seeking a closeness to what they\ncall Spirit that may prove only fully obtainable through death. Both are\ndetermined to find a purer love in life, and with the other's help, they encounter\nthe beauty of just being alive.   Poetically written, Douros weaves a tale that\nteeters on the brink of sanity within the mind of his protagonist, Guy. The\nlanguage of the novel alternates between philosophy, poetry, and vivid images\ncaptivating the reader with subtle insights and delightful moments of artistic\nportraits. A poet taunted by his psychiatric disabilities, Guy must come to\nterms with his visions that are derived from both heaven and hell and choose to\nbelieve in creative potential or shrink away from the possibility of brilliance\nand true love.   With the help from his new friend, Anna, the\nperformance artist, Guy finds the courage to confront the demons of his own\nmind. Together they discover a greater love and higher\nspirituality that is both fulfilling and dangerous. L.A. itself\nbecomes a place of bodiless voices and ghostly shapes. And while a growing sense of dread\nthreatens to tear the characters apart, by the end, the Beautiful, Winged\nMadness, that glorious delirium, seems destined to prevail.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is content and they are happy until the worst thing happens: Alissa suddenly dies from cancer. Jon has never felt more alone. He needs something, anything to pull him back from the edge of despair. A few months later, while waiting for a flight to Dallas, he meets business consultant Daryl Alexander when Daryl sits next to him and strikes up a conversation. Jon soon learns that his meeting with Daryl was not really accidental as Daryl tells him a story about him. Jon soon discovers that his talent and Navy SEAL training has made him an attractive candidate for Daryl's employer, Zeta Consulting Group. The Zeta Group is a secret organization known only to a severely limited number of people with a secret mission of their own. As Jon continues to learn, Zeta Consulting Group knows more about him than he ever imagined and Daryl is there to offer him a chance to join them and do what it takes to make a difference, if he is willing to take a chance. \"Jon Hersey-Industrial Spy\" is an interesting read. I'm not sure the title tells the real story. The main characters are more than industrial spies, much more. Although rather short, the story catches the reader's interest immediately and keeps up a high level of intensity throughout. While the plot is adequate and the dialogue is good, I think each could have been expanded somewhat to make a good story into a very good story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spend part of my time teaching at a local preschool and writing, while the rest is devoted to my family.  Writing is new to me, but storytelling has been a life long hobby.  I love using words to create images and feelings for others.  I can honestly tell a story about almost anything.  Some of my favorite storytelling memories are of telling bed time stories to my children and nieces and nephew.  They would pick random things, such as the ceiling fan, and I would make up a story about it.  Those moments are treasures to me and I hope they will be remembered by those special children too.  In that way I hope to bring special moments to my readers as well.  Writing offers me an escape from the wonderful chaos that is my life.  Raising two small children takes a lot of energy and I often collapse in my office chair late at night and let my ideas flow.  I often write from an outline, but just as often I simply sit at the computer and type until I run out of ideas.  Then I go back to make sure it all makes sense and works.  Often I find myself captivated by the story as I read because in my mad rush to type it all out I don’t really embrace the story in the way one does when reading.  My husband often laughs at me when I am reading a book of my own while wiping away the stray tear or two.  I feel it is a pretty good sign that it can touch me in that way and I hope my readers can feel the emotion that I try to inject into my stories. I find that I enjoy my self-published status because it gives me the freedom to write what I want, how I want.  I often choose characters who may not fit the norm of what most think of as a hero or heroine.  I like my characters unique and I like their story to flow from me instead of what someone else’s guidelines. I hope you enjoy my stories.  I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  amandaanderson2@tds.net Visit me on the web too http://www.AmandaAndersonBooks.com find me on facebook too!

From the very beginning, readers will sense an unnatural aura surrounding the Willow family and the desolate land where they live. Isolated from townspeople, brutalized by their father and ignored by their unstable mother, the five Willow children (some of them grown) run the farm as well as a dilapidated caravan park, a place guests never visit twice. Yearning for but fearing freedom, the children remain a tightly closed clique until Oliver, the youngest boy, shares family secrets with one of the caravan tenants, an artist, who has become infatuated with Oliver's 23-year-old sister. The first chapter's grisly images of snarling dogs, butchered sheep and incestuous acts foreshadow the series of bizarre events that spiral toward a tragic conclusion involving the murder of the most sensitive and talented member of the family. Both fascinating and disturbing, this chilling story reveals how morality can be twisted by obsessive family loyalty.

Both the\"Dragon Shaman\"and \"Shadow Chronicles\" were to deal with dimensional and world overlap, and the boundaries of where spirit plane and human plane actually are. When I was young I could not find books like that. Shadow Chronicles had originally been slated to be released first (both series fall in the same timeline, 1980 onward), but Dragon Shaman's story ended up getting written first due to life events.I chose both to start in places local to me (as in within a couple hours) as rural California was not a place I found in fiction. There was a lot of Celtic based and European centered fantasy fiction in my local libraries, but finding other cultural mythologies was not always easy. At that time, and where I was, it was also finding multicultural or multiethnic reading material. Like BlowingWind in Dragon Shaman, Willow/Angelina in the Shadow Chronicles, and Kirsty in Selkies' Skins my family tree spans many cultures, ethnicities, and locales. So I decided I would fill this gap.The Dragon Shaman series is a long way from being finished. During the original planning stage I estimated that it will take eight books to fully bring to life BlowingWind and Ryu's stories, and that of the O'Drake and MountainChild families. To get a full sense of this world the reader will want to read the \"Dragon Shaman,\" \"The Shadow Chronicles,\" and \"Selkies' Skins\" stories, as well as reading my poetry book \"Call of the Kami.\"When I first picked up the pen to start writing BlowingWind's story, instead of returning to work on Willow/Angelina's story, I was a young mother. I did not have a great deal of time to write in, and dreams were heavily involved in creating the content of the story. I never got to have a traditional spirit quest. Mine was undergone at home and during my sleeping hours so that I could accommodate both my heritage and the requirements of being in school. So I had that experience that I could draw on by this time. My father had also been diagnosed with cancer in 2004-5, the time period that the first edition was worked on.I still have that disk I saved on, and it took five total revisions before it got to the hands of an editor. There were a few revisions after that, and it was actually very tricky to preserve the odd time flow (time does not work linearly in the spirit world) and still make it understandable for those used to reading more traditional stories. Happily, the Lulu edition was published before my father passed away. He actually got to read most of the second book in its manuscript format.When I write, I can still feel him. Sometimes I read through trying to look at my work from his viewpoint, and I hope that my work today would please him. He was VERY picky about what he liked.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jane's characters find relationships in the meeting of compatible\nminds, but the modern romance reader expects zing. The zing made me think of\nEmma and Harriet more as the very young women they are, and also added an extra\nlevel of complication to the story.

Keeping true to the voice of Jane Austen,\nMicah has improved upon a classic. She has made it even more romantic, if\npossible. She's filled in the gaps for us. From Mr. Weston's proposal to Miss\nTaylor and her wanton acceptance in the garden clear through to the Knightley's\nwedding night, which was just as I would imagine it to be since Emma was most\nassuredly a virgin, when she marriedherMr. Knightley.

Despite her rural upbringing, she decided to seek employment outside the equine industry and started her working life on the front line in an acute psychiatric hospital with a multi-disciplinary medical team. After some years, the innate draw and passion for horses lured her back and she is now a dressage trainer, judge and sports psychologist, living on her own stud farm in the South East of England. She is married with three children, and has a host of dogs and horses, together with the inevitable uniform of Hunter wellies and Barbours! Drawing on her own life experiences in the medical and equine industry,she decided to write about what she knew best, and to recreate some of the wonderful (or otherwise!) characters that she has met and weave them into a novel. Rough Ride is that story. The sequel to Rough Ride - and there is a rip roaring sequel - is already in its embryo form and should be published at the end of the year! Happy reading!

Two months ago he was the most eligible bachelor in Pittsburgh society and the apple of his grandfather's eye. One month ago found him keeping vigil at the old man's bedside. A week ago he watched as Granddad was laid to rest, and less than a minute ago the words he'd just heard uttered left him speechless.\"There must be some mistake,\" he said, finally finding his voice. \"Let me see the will.\"Randall McCord rose from his seat behind the heavy walnut desk and handed the document to him. Peter took it and, rising from one of the leather chairs, crossed his grandfather's wood-paneled study to the window. He felt the blood leave his face as he took in Granddad's final words. He'd been left nothing, absolutely nothing. Peter's brow furrowed. \"I don't understand,\" he muttered.\"I realize after my misunderstanding with my father you imagined he would leave everything to you—\"\"Misunderstanding?\" Peter locked eyes with his uncle. \"I would hardly call nearly ruining everything Granddad worked for a 'misunderstanding'!\" His uncle's eyes narrowed and Peter knew he'd struck a nerve. Uncle Randall's heavy-handed ways had almost run McCord Steel and Ironworks into the ground. The mill had lost a great deal of money and the workers had come close to rioting. Granddad had been beside himself with anger; so much so, he cut off his only son. \"In light of that fact,\" Peter continued. \"I'm the most logical choice as heir in spite of the fact that my interests lay elsewhere.\"\"Oh yes, yourinterests\"his cousin Edward drawled, leaning against the bookcase behind his father. \"Horse racing and chasing after every attractive young lady in the city.\"\"At least I have them to chase,\" Peter shot back. With his strong, handsome face, chocolate brown hair, and—as Granddad used to say—eyes greener than a spring meadow, Pittsburgh's eligible young ladies were more than willing quarry. Of course being Hiram Mc-Cord's heir didn't hurt either. \"Tell me, how are your marriage prospects?\"A slow, smug smile grew over his cousin's face. \"Much improved now thatI'mheir of McCord Steel and you're—\"\"That's enough.\" Uncle Randall glanced sharply at his son. \"Peter, what exactly did you expect? Considering your disastrous time at Princeton—\"\"I did graduate,\" Peter snapped, rereading the will carefully.\"Barely. You spent more time at the racetracks than attending to your studies. I'm sure my father realized you couldn't possibly oversee his fortune.\"\"Granddad knew I wouldn't run the mill like he did. He knew I had every intention of hiring the best possible man to oversee its operation.\"\"While you exhaust the McCord fortune on horses, I suppose.\"\"Granddad approved of my interest in horses. It was his idea to buy the farm in Ligonier—\"\"Then why didn't he leave you even the smallest stipend to keep the farm running?\"Ignoring the question, Peter strode over to his uncle. \"Granddad couldn't have left everything to you. He wouldn't have.\" He shook the document. \"This can't possibly be the correct will. It must be an older version.\"\"It's the correct one, Peter,\" Edward said. \"Didn't you check the date?\"Peter looked at the will again. It had been signed a little over a year ago. He put his hand over his eyes. What could he have done over the past year to cause his grandfather to do this? Why hadn't he at least warned him? Peter stiffened. That last night, before Granddad slipped away in his sleep, the old man had begged for his understanding when the will was read. Peter had thought it was the laudanum talking. He felt a hand on his shoulder. His uncle had risen from his seat and now stood next to him.\"It was my father's last wish that you be taken care of, and it is one I intend to honor,\" he said, his hand turning viselike.Peter shook free, handed the will to his uncle, and walked to the door. \"I'll take care of myself, thank you, Uncle Randall.\"\"And how will you manage to do that, may I ask?\"Peter turned. His uncle resumed his seat behind the desk.\"You've been left with nothing. Not even the smallest sum of money.\" Peter remained silent and he continued. \"As I said, I am willing to support you, but there will be a few conditions.\"\"And those would be?\"\"It's high time you used that education my father paid for. I assume you learnedsomethingin spite of your horrendous marks.\" His uncle's eyes narrowed keenly. \"You will come to work for me at the mill and earn your keep for a change.\"Peter smiled humorlessly and shook his head.\"My thanks for the offer, Uncle, but I have a very promising colt that will be ready to race soon. I think I'll take my chances with him. In the meantime, I'm sure Henry won't mind me staying with him.\" Peter knew he and his horse trainer would think of something to keep the farm running. Sell off a few mares perhaps— His uncle's voice stopped him in mid-thought.\"You could, if the farm still belonged to you.\"Peter felt the blood leave his face. \"What do you mean?\"\"Despite the fact he bought it for you, it seems the farm is still in my father's name. Not yours. Therefore, it now belongs to me. I intend on dismissing Henry Farley and selling off the animals as quickly as possible.\"Peter tried to digest what he'd just heard as his uncle moved swiftly on. \"The other condition concerns Miss Leticia Jamison.\"", "related": ["B00GAKUKR2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has undergraduate degrees in History and Theology from Newbold College, England. Henderson served as an assistant dean and professor legal philosophy at a private law school in Southern California before entering private practice.  He focuses on personal injury litigation along with medical injuries and injuries from defective products.   Henderson is also an author. After his father-in-law died of Leukemia, he investigated the treatment of chronic diseases and wrote Indicted! Nutritional Healing vs. The Pharmaceutical Suppression of Symptoms (2009), which reveals how managing the symptoms  of disease has become big business. Whisper of the Serpent: How a False Religious Theory of Knowledge Destroyed Ancient and Modern Science and Medicine, (2011), surveys 2,500 years of science and medicine to show how and why modern medicine has diverted from its true focus: healing disease. The Scramble for Jerusalem, (2012), discusses how the attempts by the world's five major religions to make Jerusalem the capital of their coming Messianic kingdom aggravates Middle East tensions and could lead to a world crisis.  Henderson is president of a non-profit organization, CRCL, Inc. which runs a medical and dental clinic in the remote villages areas of Haiti, and engages in other religious and educational mission work in various third world countries.  James and his wife, Nancy, live in beautiful Grass Valley where they love exploring the out of doors with hiking companions.  Nancy, an artist of Mediterranean art, owns Tuscany Art Gallery and  Sunnymaids Referral Agency, a housecleaning business in Roseville.", "related": [], "rank": 2689057, "title": "Terror Over Jerusalem.

The room was packed to bursting, between the leadership of wolves, the Fae and humans. Eyes closed, I tried to listen through the din for specific voices but it was too chaotic to follow. They were all speaking at once.   \"Enough,\" Cormac said, or more accurately, yelled. He very seldom raised his voice but after the week we'd just had, I wasn't surprised he was more on edge than normal.   One week ago today, we had closed the final tear in the universe, located exactly where New York City used to be. The hell that we unleashed was beyond any of our imaginations. Slow death by radiation was looking more and more like it might have been the better choice. That was no longer an option. We'd merged our existence with the plane of magic, and for better or worse, this was the new world, perhaps the only world.   There was no way of telling what happened to Vitor's planet. It was too risky to try and open a wormhole now, if it were even possible. What once might have had a predictable outcome was now a game of Russian Roulette. That's what happens when the machine gets all gunked up with extra crap in the engine. In this case, the extra crap happened to be magic.    Magic. Does anyone really even know what it is? If I'd been asked for a definition a year ago, I would have said it was beautiful and impossible things, unicorns frolicking under rainbows and pots of gold guarded by strange little men wearing green. It might still be all of those things...but it was also so much more. It was the ghastly images from nightmares and your deepest fears come to life. And now, it was just your run of the mill day, sitting at a meeting with creatures you didn't know existed a year ago.   The packed conference room fell silent and I forced my heavy eyelids open. Cormac stood, leaning over the table, palms flat on its surface with his head bent down. His shirtsleeves were rolled up as usual, showing off the tense muscular forearms that accented even further how on edge he was, if you hadn't already picked up on his \"rip your head off\" tone.   If he had been a mentally weaker man, this would've been his breaking point. I know if I thought it was an option, it would've been mine. I've never considered myself a slouch in the stamina department, but my limits were being tested daily.   I looked around the room as the silence continued. This was one of the many \"open\" meetings we'd had since our return. Everyone would all come in and wait for Cormac to utter some words of brilliance that would make things okay, would make sense of the chaos that ensued after New York. They just didn't get it. There was nothing that was going to make this okay. We'd destroyed something that night and there was no fixing it. This was it.   Burrom, Vitor, Rogo and all their people...the ones still alive that is, had been waiting for us at  The Lacard when we finally managed to get back. \"We\" is what's left of The Keepers, a number that was less than it had been a week ago. We'd lost three just on the way home, not to mention the heap of metal that had once been a shiny 747.   \"I don't have any answers,\" Cormac's voice broke the silence and brought me roughly back to the present.   \"What are those grey creatures hovering out there? The ones everyone calls the rippers?\" A human named Sally asked. \"They ate one of my friends! Tore him apart, limb by limb, in front of us.\"   \"I told you, I don't know. We're working on it.\" Cormac ran a hand through his black hair, the shadow along his jaw darker than normal.   I felt human eyes upon me but ignored them. I had the Fae and wolves' attention as well, and I ignored them too, staring up at the ceiling instead. They all wanted to come here to Earth. So much so, they'd been willing to do it by any means possible. Now that it had turned ugly, they wanted to blame The Keepers for it, and me most of all. And the thing I feared the most was, maybe they were right.   It was hard to defend yourself when you could barely breathe past the guilt that weighed down your chest. I ignored them until their attention moved elsewhere, which I knew it shortly would. The anger was in plentiful supply and was being spread out liberally.   \"I want the seventh floor. The ninth is unlucky and I won't stay there anymore,\" Burrom said, as the fight for domain began again. They'd been bickering between themselves nonstop about who would take what area. The stout little Fae was the only one in the room that seemed unfretted by everything else going on. All he cared about was his sleeping requirements.   \"Done,\" Cormac answered, I think relieved to have a problem so easily fixed.   \"Wait...I already set up on the seventh,\" Vitor said. You'd never know that Vitor and Burrom were of the same race. Vitor was the epitome of casual and refined grace, even if he was twitching more than a chipmunk on crack lately.   \"Move your shit.\" Cormac leaned a little further in the direction of Vitor. \"I said you could stay here. If you've got an issue with the accommodations...leave. That goes for all of you.\" He looked to Vitor, Burrom, Rogo and Adam, who was the human's representative.   Now that the shit had hit the fan, there were no secrets left to protect. All the cards were on the table, well, as far as the humans knew anyway, but this was one of the open meetings. There were still the closed meetings where the real shit went down, but no one, including myself, thought the humans were ready for that.   \"We need larger food rations,\" Adam said, changing the subject.   \"No, you don't. If your people stopped hoarding what they get and actually ate it instead, they'd be fine,\" Cormac said.   \"They're scared,\" Mark defended.   \"We've got enough.\" Cormac flipped through a few sheets of paper in front of him.   \"We'll get more.\"   Mark dropped the subject but I wondered the same thing in my head. Cormac couldn't single handedly grow food for everyone and we had a limited amount. I took a sip out of my coffee canister filled mostly with coffee and a drop of whiskey. It was only eleven a.m. I certainly couldn't go to the straight stuff for at least a few more hours.   \"What about my sister?\" Vitor asked.   \"What about her?\" Cormac asked - it wasn't a question, it was a threat.   \"We had a deal.\" I heard the slightest quiver in Vitor's voice. He was realizing the same thing I was noticing; this wasn't the same Cormac I knew a week ago. The Cormac of old would have beaten him to an inch of his life. This Cormac wouldn't leave an inch. I was getting the distinct impression that Cormac was shedding his civilized façade just as quickly as civilization had fallen to ruins.   \"Things change.\" Cormac glanced at me and I got the message. It felt as if his eyes were piercing straight through to my soul. Vitor wasn't the only person that had run out of time and he wanted to make sure I understood that loud and clear.    Vitor, predictable as ever, continued on. \"You are a Keeper. You keep the portals, the contracts, the peace. You can't just disregard the agreements.\"   \"Everybody here better listen up.\" Cormac scanned the room, meeting stare after stare. \"The Lacard is the last bastion in the storm. And it belongs to me. My rules, my way. Yesterday doesn't exist. You get in the way of my survival, then you get out.\" He turned and looked pointedly at Vitor before he spoke his next words. \"There will be no more portals, no more contracts and if you want peace, then you better be ready to fight for it.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.7391, "rating_total": 109.0}

Maggie has just\nsigned her divorce papers and is finally free of the abusive husband she\n had once loved dearly. She is ready to start life again and try to\nforget her previous unhappy life. Maggie loves reading and history, and\nto begin her new life she plans a trip to Bisbee, Arizona, a place that\nhas always been of special interest because of its rich historical past.\n While on an historic tour, Maggie never expected to find a ghost there.\n Joseph appears to Maggie while she is alone and she feels a sudden\nconnection. As Joseph begins to explain that they were married over 100\nyears ago and he has been waiting for her all these years, Maggie faints\n and so ends the tour as she is immediately taken to the local hospital.\n As Maggie's mind clears, she is not sure if what happened was a dream, a\n wish, or perhaps she has just gone crazy. As she continues her\nexploring, however, once again Joseph is there and he takes her back to\nthe first time they met. As Maggie's time in Bisbee continues, we spend\ntime with her and Joseph and learn of the deep love they had shared.Yesterday's Kiss was a beautiful story of love, and though I am not a\ngreat fan of ghost stories this one had a different feel. Carly Fall\nmade it plausible and very believable and I could do nothing but share\nin Maggie's confusion, while hoping for a happy ending. Yesterday's Kiss\n is only eighty-four pages but each one is a gem.

At age thirteen he graduated to Tolkien and Heinlein, building up a book collection that soon rivaled the local public library’s. In college Mark majored in Journalism and minored in English. Mark has published four other books with Camel Press: Things to Do in Denver When You’re Un-Dead, What Happens in Vegas Dies in Vegas, I Left My Haunt in San Francisco (Books 1, 2, and 3 of the From the Files of the BSI series) as well as a standalone novel, The Judas Line, which was a finalist for the ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Award in the Fantasy Category.

Thanksgiving is often one of those. This small book, however, is filled with rich teaching of great benefit to beginners and mature believers alike. Refreshingly told, it s an easy read certain to lift your spirit and perhaps even spark a needed attitude adjustment. You will be blessed as you read! --Loren Sandford, Pastor of New Song Church, Colorado, and author of Visions of the Coming DaysRolland and I have been deeply impacted by the ministry of Fred and Sharon Wright. After receiving prayer from them, my life was forever transformed. I am eternally thankful to them, and now they have gone and written a beautiful book on thanksgiving! Having known this man and woman for nearly two decades, filled with Father God's love, it is with great joy that I recommend this book to you, not only to read but also to put into practice the giving of thanks with all that is within you! Read and be blessed. --Heidi Baker, Founding Director, Iris Global\"THANK YOU, LORD!\" How basic a concept, yet, how delightfully refreshing and renewing is this very important reminder to practise thanksgiving to God as a way of life. Read in a single sitting, I chuckled, nodded, reflected, smiled and even winced a time or two as the impact of Fred and Sharon s offering found its mark. Most remarkable is the progressively re-heightened sense of thanksgiving to God that is almost certain to well up in the heart of the reader, as it did in me. This transparent telling of experience and story interwoven with timeless scriptural truths serves as a timely catalyst to the more frequent and intentional thanksgiving that so needs to be a daily practice. --Brenda C.

In this 10th volume of The Honeybee Series, children will learn the fascinating process the honeybee uses to create each small drop of honey. Did you know that a honeybee makes only about a quarter of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime? I didn't until reading this book. This is just one of the many interesting facts within the pages of this text. Readers both young and old will learn something new in this intriguing little book. For a sweet treat of a read, pick up a copy of Honeybee's Recipe Book.Honeybee's Recipe Book is the second book in Jeanette Vuuren's The Honeybee Series that I have read, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book as much as the first one. Vuuren's account of the honeybee's activities was accurate, informative, and easy to follow. The book included an excellent list of vocabulary words and even had a quick and easy recipe for Honey Crackles that would be a great cross-curriculum activity for classrooms or a fun rainy day activity for the home. Once again, Sudipta Dasgupta's illustrations were bright and cheerful and succeeded in added an extra dose of fun to the book. After seeing the quality of two of the books in The Honeybee Series, I am quite interested in reading the entire series and would gladly add it to my own children's library.", "related": ["B00HK4RUHK"], "rank": 2636633, "title": "Sudipta Dasgupta", "author": "Jeanette Vuuren", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With his mother and brother, he moved to England in 1919 and attended Rossall School in Lancashire before moving on to Cambridge University to study law. His studies there came to a halt when a publisher accepted his first novel. His third book, entitledMeet the Tiger!, was written when he was twenty years old and published in September 1928. It introduced the world to Simon Templar, aka the Saint.He continued to write about the Saint until 1983 when the last book,Salvage for the Saint, was published. The books, which have been translated into over thirty languages, number nearly a hundred and have sold over 40 million copies around the world. They’ve inspired, to date, fifteen feature films, three TV series, ten radio series, and a comic strip that was written by Charteris and syndicated around the world for over a decade. He enjoyed travelling but settled for long periods in Hollywood, Florida, and finally in Surrey, England. He was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers’ Association in 1992, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement. He died the following year.To find out more about Leslie Charteris and his work, visit www.lesliecharteris.com.", "related": [], "rank": 366562, "title": "The Saint and the People Importers (The Saint Series)", "author": "Leslie Charteris", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My sister and brothers and I thought everyone had a good grandma and an evil grandma and visited crazy cousins every year. My own three sons have five cousins, and my grandchildren have none. My parents' marriage lasted a lifetime; none of the 30 aunts and uncles ever divorced, either. Writers are said to write about what they know. I know family. I've been writing ever since I published a newspaper when I was 12, after my good grandmother showed me how to make a hectograph, a primitive gelatin press that made about 50 copies before the purple ink got too light to read. When I was a little older and taught school for a year, I self-published a book of drama activities for kids, which sold 2,000 copies. Much later, I wrote a textbook for social workers to help them go to court to protect kids without getting their throat ripped out by opposing counsel. And then there were literary stories in journals. Meanwhile, after farming tomatoes and doing radio documentaries and animations and getting a play produced, I worked as a child protection lawyer for abused and neglected kids, and then as a gestalt therapist working with family issues. I suppose it's always been about family for me. I'm close to my siblings, my three sons (two of whom share my genetic flaw for writing; one is sane), my ex-wives and my pre-ex. I like solitude a lot, but intimacy a whole lot more. I write in winters at my sister's hotel in Mexico, which has become a \"family of choice\" in its own right. Humans are amazing.Going to dark places with people, including characters in stories, is a little easier if you're a committed joymonger, which I am. Once joy becomes something besides a choice of last resort, it gets a whole lot easier to see the humor in our glorious, absurd humanness. One way or another, that's the storyworld I like to write about, hopefully in a way that's both entertaining and heartfelt.", "related": [], "rank": 3223454, "title": "Ethical Seduction: ...a dozen for the beach (Collected Stories Book 1)", "author": "Barry Friesen", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My passion for writing began with Jacque Pennington, who taught me English as parts of speech in Middle School. By the age of seventeen, I had written my first full length feature film script. During that same time, I went on to win editor's choice awards for my poetry and was invited to the National Poet's Symposium in Washington DC at the age of eighteen.  I wrote another full length feature film at the age of eighteen and started writing novels shortly thereafter. As I have a very discerning taste, many of my first novels were cast into the trash as they didn't have enough clout to hold my interest.  In 2005 I started attending the University of Phoenix. I was fortunate enough to be mentored by Don Miles during that time. My career as an Internet Marketing Manager took off around this time and the novel Isiah's Skirmish was put on hold. In 2012, I was prompted to work extremely hard and finish the remaining 170 pages of Isiah's Skirmish as it had been near completion for many years.  I have strong respect for the works of: Michael Chrichton and John Grisham. My favorite Hollywood Films are: Spy Game, Crazy Stupid Love, The Usual Suspects, The Dark Knight, End of Watch, and The Incredibles. On Television, I enjoy: The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Dexter, and Modern Family.  My current project is a Political Suspense Thriller and I hope you join me for the ride. It should be out by the Fall of 2013.", "related": ["B00GMQOUCU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}
