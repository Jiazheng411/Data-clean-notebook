Jake explains what happened the day he was a waiter when the first graders opened the \"Breakfast Club\" in their classroom and about the time a student took her dog to school and it ran off with Jake's stuffed elephant. The two siblings squabble but it is normal, harmless teasing, and when the chips are down they band together, as in the chapter about their run-in with the school bully. The family cat, Fluzzy, ends the book with a brief chapter of how he also would like a new name. Stevenson's trademark ink sketches add interest and humor to the stories.

That such a gargantuan undertaking could be kept secret from the enemy has been difficult to understand. In Breuer's suspenseful, detailed narrative he shows how \"the greatest hoax in history,\" as Winston Churchill called it, was accomplished. A major element in the complicated plan was a ruse encouraging the Germans to believe that massive formations under General George Patton were preparing to land at Pas de Calais. Another aspect was the bogus radio traffic of the fictitious Fourth Army, supposedly assembling in Scotland. Still another was the performance of an actor who impersonated General Bernard Montgomery so convincingly during an \"inspection tour\" at Gibraltar that the Germans concluded that Montgomery was about to lead an Allied invasion into southern France. Breuer ( Retaking the Philippines ) describes the D-Day invasion itself, the hard fighting that followed and the Allied breakout from Normandy that marked one of the turning points of WW II.

He goes back to a jokey Sports Illustrated article he once did about the world's fastest pitcher, an English-born Buddhist monk called Sidd Finch, who learned his speed and accuracy hurling rocks at marauding snow leopards in the Himalayas. Plimpton fits him out with an eccentric British past, a gorgeous but kookie Southern girl friend and a tentative contract with the Mets. But despite a relaxedsometimes much too relaxednarrative style, and a lot of pleasant rambling about horn-playing, wrist musculature and the future of baseball, the book just doesn't go anywhere. It's as if Plimpton threw in everything he could think of to pad it out to novel length, and some of the paddingincluding a totally inept episode about a Mafia gamblershould have been cut early on. Baseball fans will enjoy parts of this, but even they will feel cheated that there's no real climax. The book, like Finch, just ambles off the field.

In this fourth volume about Francis, 15, and the children he \"adopted,\" Lottie and Billy, the trio struggles to stay out of the clutches of the evil Comancheros (men who trade with the nomadic Comanches) from whom the youngsters escaped in the previous book. Paulsen's trademark emphasis on survival, \"man versus nature,\" is here in fine measure, but so, too, is a melodramatic plot. First, the three young people are saved from their pursuers by a summer thunderstorm; then they find an escaped group of Indian ponies; then they discover a cache of Spanish gold. Next, Francis is bitten by a rattlesnake and nursed back to health by Pueblo Indians while Lottie and Billy learn to live with the tribe. Finally, after the threesome leaves the Pueblos to resume their search for Francis's real family, the Comancheros catch them. In a conclusion that's shockingly violent for the intended audience, the young people kill their captors. Their journey, in conjunction with any one or two of the above episodes, might have been the heart of a first-rate novel, but combined, it's all just too unbelievable. No doubt Tucket's fans will clamor for the book, but it's mostly a nonnutritive meal.Coop Renner, Moreno Elementary School, El Paso, TXCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After being fired from his position as chief deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor John Howard for allegedly drinking on the job, Tom Burton begins a second career as a lobbyist. Every day, starting at 11:30 a.m., Burton holds court from a bar stool at Otto's, a downtown L.A. establishment frequented by local politicos where he successfully lobbies for a list of top clients. A longtime player in the local political scene known to be bitter about his termination--he denied the drinking charge--Burton raises eyebrows throughout the county when he begins poking around the activities of his former boss. So when Supervisor Howard and his secretary are found shot to death in a hot tub, suspicion naturally falls on Burton. But L.A. County Undersherriff Wilt Robinson is certain that Burton, his former patrol partner, is innocent. So is Kathy Boyd, a Los Angeles Times reporter assigned to write an article about the chief deputy-turned-lobbyist. However, when Kathy's work on the story causes her to fall afoul of a powerful drug cartel, Tom will have to use every tool at his disposal to clear his name--and to save himself and the pretty reporter from danger. The author, a former deputy to a L.A. County supervisor, uses his knowledge about the inner workings of county government to imbue this thriller with a sense of realism. Hibbard seemingly voices his political beliefs through his characters, using this book to lob the occasion potshot at the other side. The book's main shortcoming is an ending that stretches credulity to the breaking point--if not beyond--but the bulk of this thriller is a clear-eyed look at the intersection of money, sex and power in Los Angeles, brought to life by an interesting and varied cast of characters.   A well-crafted thriller, as interesting for its insider's view of government as for its plot. --Kirkus DiscoveriesThe author of this book had over 20 years of hands on, day by day experience in learning and working the system of Los Angeles County government. Being as close as I was to the people, locations, and events portrayed in this novel leads me to conclude that it is really a great read. Take a look for yourself. --Pete Schabarum, Retired Los Angeles County SupervisorThe characters, events and places described give an exciting, realistic side to the inner workings of county government. Mr. Hibbard covers it well in a very human, humorous manner.  Brought back a flood of memories! --Yolanda (Sanchez) Wilson, Ret.

I had more adventure in store for protagonists Jack Rand and Karen Smitrovich and such a fondness for Unim, the biped plant from Zeta6 (pronounced Zeta Six), that I wanted him to return to Earth on another mission of great importance. So, I began \"Time and Time Again\" in April 2002 and finished it in December 2002. I'd always been interested in time travel and felt for sure that it was possible. I also believed that, in order to understand how time travel might be possible, you first had to comprehend the basic properties of time and space and the simple, yet complex way in which these two cosmological elements, along with gravity, control most of our physical, living experiences. Recurring themes in \"Time and Time Again\" include extraterrestrial influences in human lives, the eternal conflict between good and evil, the importance of and the power in making a choice, and the dire consequences of greed and unbridled personal liberty. Back in 2002, my intention was to begin a new career, writing science fiction novels that were based on my own observations of life, the world around us, and that vast unknown we call \"the universe\". I used fictional settings in all my novels, referenced by real places to add credibility and believability to my tales of supernatural wonder and the eternal conflict between good and evil. I also gave carte blanche to my seemingly boundless imagination. The result, I think, is a highly readable, evenbelievable, blend of science fiction, action/adventure, humor and, yes, even a little romance.The Science Fiction for Thinkers collection is not your typical genre sci-fi. And it's definitely not horror or fantasy, which are often billed as science fiction. In my sci-fi there are no superheroes, no capes and swords, no castles and princes, no dragons or warlords, no flying waffle irons or, heaven forbid, vampires. My heroes are everyday men and women, the atypical protagonists whose antagonists are often exotic creatures with unbridled personal ambition.Science Fiction for Thinkers has a little something for everyone. But the biggest offering is \"hard science fiction\" that includes exciting high-tech wizardry and cutting-edge concepts about life, time and space, and death. Plus a world of adventure for thinkers and seekers. As a science fiction author, I endeavored to open a new window on the everyday world and to offer a unique vision of the cosmos. I like to think that, if you take a chance and dare to read my particular brand of \"crossover\" science fiction, your world may never look the same.As always, \"Happy reading, no matter who or what you choose to read.\"", "related": ["B00FI23NDG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

John's position is particularly fragile since Justinian's support is notoriously fickle and his consort, the beautiful and dangerous Theodora, despises John. When an entertainment devised for Theodora results in the death of a young royal hostage and the disappearance of Barnabas, the empress's favorite dwarf, John is once again charged with the difficult and delicate task of ferreting out the truth. He is also charged with protecting the life of the remaining hostage, eight-year-old Sunilda, a task made even more daunting by the child's recklessness. Set not in Constantinople but on the nearby estate of a wealthy noble, the authors' latest mystery combines a finely nuanced historical background with a plot of great subtlety. The details of daily life, from food and food preparation to the care and writing of manuscripts, enhance the action. And the ongoing struggle between Christianity (Justinian's state religion) and the pagan rites that play a central role in the plot is particularly well drawn. If there's any flaw it's that John, while a sympathetic protagonist, is too self-contained to really arouse the reader's passions. Nonetheless, those who appreciate strong historical backgrounds and solid plotting will get their money's worth. The Byzantine mosaic art on the jacket is a real plus.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

First, it captures the essence of being a fighter pilot in combat, [offering] a true picture of the air war in a far corner of the world. Second, it is a charming love story.  It is about the love that is felt by the very young, living their life to the hilt and loving for keeps. And finally, it is a subtle analysis of a war that went bad.[Son of Thunder] is a story that is told quietly, knowingly, and just about as well as it can be told. --The Longboat ObserverSon of Thunder is one of the finest Vietnam-era fighter pilot stories I have ever read. Once I started it I could not put it down. --Mig SweepThe novel is cleverly crafted on several levels: protagonist John Ellsworth loves the F-100 and Army nurse Kate Moffit. Kate loves John but hates his vocation.  Add the cynicism of Dusty's Puband the pilots' collective disdain for politicians who listen to protesters instead of patriots and the story makes for quite a mix.[Son of Thunder] is fast paced and hard to put down, as Wetterling's writing about flying is breathlessly real.  Veterans will sweat while the rest of us will be given a vivid image of what it must have been like.  The only thing missing is the oxygen mask. --Flight Journal[T]his offering from J.D. Wetterlingproves that successful books come when authors write about things they are most familiar with.  Wetterling makes the reader feel like he is in the cockpit of a virtual-reality simulator. If you liked the movie Top Gun, you will surely enjoy this book. It's a story of ego, gripping fear and adrenaline rushes, conjured up from the deep recesses of a fighter pilot's mind. It explores the intense relationship between pilot and plane as they dance the wild blue, and the human relationship where the power of love fights to prevail.  --Sarasota Herald Tribune", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Starting out at 15 he dropped out of high school and the first thing he bought was an (electric) guitar at 16. Taking lessons in classical guitar over four years on an electric guitar was quite unusual, more so for his teacher. At the age of 20, Rob bought his first of many pianos, and it's the piano that has stuck with Rob for the last 30 years.  Rob settled on a career in music but writing and poetry would always hold a strong influence over him. After many years study to become a composer and with seven years study in compositions and orchestration, writing and poetry became stronger than his love of music.  Rob has had his writing published in a variety of newspapers, magazines, books and online. As a poet Rob's writing all have a distinct style, you can feel his poetical influences in his prose and you will find that all of Rob's words have a way of getting under your skin - in a good way.Some of Rob's favourite authors are Patrick White, H.G. Wells, Vladimir Nabokov, and Ayn Rand. H.G. Wells is a particular influence on Rob; his ideas of social justice lie at the heart of a lot of Rob's writings and thoughts. Along with the great inventive and dramatic ideas that Wells brought to his writing, Rob's aim is to bring not only the dramatic but that inner world of seldom spoken feeling and wants out onto the page.Rob is compiling a book of his short stories; he has a short novel Park Street up on Amazon, along with a sampling of his short prose and verse novels. His next book,Paintedto be released this year and next year 2012 a dramatic espionage story,The Disease.Rob is also compiling a book of short stories in collaboration with over 20 writers, titledThe Book of Fascination.If you like to find out more about Rob and his works, you will find links to his blog and various other sites on his Amazon Author page.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time. His use of the time-honored artifice of writing under a pseudonym comes from the necessity to still maintain a day job and the habit of employers to Google new applicants to discover what stupid things said applicant is willing to foolishly do, and then doubly foolishly post for the world to see afterwards. Such invasions of one’s personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother’s secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually “better” he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, “Writing time is always good time.” He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B003HS5048"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Q. Garza,  Wisconsin Lawyer -  May 1, 2002This book is the companion volume toNursing Home Litigation: Investigation and Case Preparationand is the second in a planned series of three on this topic. The editor and contributing author of this book, Ruben Krisztal, is an attorney with more than sixteen years of experience in litigating nursing home cases. Equally telling, however, is the range and depth of experience of the other sixteen contributing authors not all of whom are lawyers. It is this collection of experience that gives this book its strength....[The book] gives the relatively new nursing home litigator a practical step-by-step process to follow. The book also has enough substance to assist seasoned trial attorneys.Certain chapters provide a nice refresher on basic litigation techniques and address specifics on dealing with the elderly. Some chapters have stand-alone tips segments that provide important information that even veteran attorneys can easily overlook. One such tip in the chapter on handling older witnesses gives a list of do's and don'ts of communicating with a hearing impaired older witness. These tips are helpful, if not for their direct usefulness, then for the way they can help the reader better understand the complexities of dealing with nursing home cases.Other chapters provide significant and substantive treatment to issues of which all nursing home litigators should take notice. For example, 50 pages are devoted to the chapter on preparing and using demonstrative evidence. This book is an excellent reference for attorneys currently involved in litigating nursing home cases. It is a \"must-have\" for attorneys new to nursing home litigation or litigation involving other adult assisted living facilities.", "related": [], "rank": 2983220, "title": "Nursing Home Litigation: Pretrial Practice and Trials, Second Edition", "author": "Ruben J.

The detectives seem to be in fourth or fifth grade, while the story is a transitional reader, with short chapters, big print, and lots of fun black-and-white cartoon illustrations. Badger Point School is celebrating its 100th anniversary, and a statue of the school's first principal, Simon Plunkett, has disappeared hours before the celebration. The kids have a scrap of wet paper, a broken pencil, and a skateboard as clues. The mystery takes place in the school and mostly in the Cafeteri-Audi-Nasium. A custodian doubles or triples as art teacher, coach, bus driver, cook, and show director. There are a few silly spots: one of the boys keeps losing his pants and a chance encounter in a darkened closet causes a flood, but the mystery is not easily solved and many readers will be surprised and pleased when the statue is found. The story moves quickly, and those looking for a humorous read will enjoy it. Although it is part of a series, it can stand alone and could encourage young readers ready for chapter books.-Susan Lissim, Dwight School, New York Cityα(c) Copyright 2011.

Following an 18-year sentence, Oh Hyun Woo discovers that his former lover, Han Yoon Hee, has died. Oh returns to Kalmae, where they lived together, and discovers Yoon Hee's journals and letters to him. From there, the narrative combines Oh's memories and Yoon Hee's, often flowing seamlessly between the two. Yoon Hee's letters to Oh are layered in rich details and life-changing revelations, suggesting she knows all along that these letters will one day be all that's left of their relationship. Sok-Yong's attention to detail is especially powerful in Oh's descriptions of prison life and returning to the outside world, like waking up from a nap at the end of a summer day when the sun is setting. Oh and Yoon Hee's languid, heartbreaking tales of loss and waiting complement each other beautifully, evoking the spirit ofLove in the Time of Solitude.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lynch Street is the site of the black Jackson State College, where two black men were killed during antiwar and civil-rights protests in May 1970, 10 days after the Kent State University incident where four white students were slain by National Guardsmen. According to Spofford, a writer for the Albany Times Union , the Jackson State killings have been largely forgotten in contrast to the Kent State deaths. In his account, Spofford relies mainly on interviews with the wounded students and the families of the dead. He traces the mounting tensions on Lynch Street between blacks and whites and maintains that Jackson State students were not known for their political activism; yet a mini-riot, fueled by an atmosphere of racism, escalated, and the police panicked, called for extra help and began shooting. Spofford suc cessfully recalls the moment with primary sources. His reportage is rigorous but somewhat repetitious and not particularly analytical. The evidence of the killings was studied by a presidential commission, two grand juries and a civil court but, as Spofford demonstrates, the racial strain was not settled by a court of law and has yet to be resolved.

Hacia 1805 escribió en el periódico el Diario de México. En 1812, tras las reformas promulgadas por la Constitución de Cádiz, Fernández de Lizardi fundó el periódico El Pensador Mexicano, nombre que usó como seudónimo. Entre 1815 y 1816, publicó dos nuevos periódicos: Alacena de frioleras y el Cajoncito de la alacena. En mayo de 1820, se restableció en México el gobierno constitucional y, con la libertad de imprenta, fueron abolidas la Inquisición y la Junta de Censura. Entonces Fernández de Lizardi fundó el periódico El conductor eléctrico, a favor de los ideales constitucionales;y apenas unos años después, en 1823, editó otro periódico, El hermano del Perico.

As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person. Currently, he has more than twenty books written, most of which are available worldwide as e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Google, Kobo, and Apple.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Aili and Andres McConnon’s book it offers a moving example of moral courage. A simple citizen and great athlete chose to oppose a cruel and racist political dictatorship by saving Jewish victims in Italy. Was it so hard to become a hero then? It was enough--enough to remain human. And yet.” –Elie Wiesel “The two Tours de France won by Bartali are more than mere entries in the record book of winners. The fact that they were won many years apart proves what an exceptional champion he really was. Above all, the war years separating these victories now reveal Gino to have been a true hero.” –Christian Prudhomme, director of the Tour de France \"Whether you are a Tour de France fan, a history buff, or looking for an entertaining way to learn about both,Road to Valorwill have you turning the pages with more conviction and speed than Bartali could turn the pedals!  An engaging and mesmerizing read.\" –Craig Hummer, Tour de France broadcaster for NBC Sports “A gritty, scary story of endurance,Road to Valortraces one man’s harrowing journey from the resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Italy to a comeback triumph in the Tour de France—told with verve and an affecting appreciation of the human spirit.” –Bruce Porter,New York Times bestselling author of Blow \"This book is a magnificent ride through the uphill-downhill-uphill story of Gino Bartali.

Bartali is a hero for all times.\"–Fred Plotkin, author ofItaly for the Gourmet Traveler “Many cycling fans recognize the name Gino Bartali, and up until now most people only knew him for the races he won. But during some of the most tumultuous years of the twentieth century he leveraged his fame and risked his life for those being persecuted. With this complete look at Bartali’s life, his legacy as one of cycling’s greatest heroes grows even stronger.” –Chris Carmichael, legendary coach and former Giro d’Italia and Tour de France racer “Bartali is one of cycling's great icons, and this book adds another important dimension to this man's world.” –Sir Paul Smith “It is with genuine pleasure that I recommend to men and women of all ages and all religious and ethnic backgroundsRoad to Valorby Aili and Andres McConnon.  It recounts a true story that is marvelously exciting and inspiring as well.  The heroism of so many Italians during World War II and afterwards is a tale that needs to be told, and the authors tell it masterfully.  Their readers will be deeply touched by the courage of the hero of the book, Gino Bartali, and others who put their lives at risk to protect the innocent and defend both their faith and their commitment to democracy.” –Edward Cardinal Egan, Archbishop Emeritus of New York “At a time when so many sports figures have come to personify scandal and bad behavior, how refreshing it is to read the inspiring tale of Gino Bartali's life.  The McConnons have drawn a portrait of the Italian cycling legend that uplifts the spirit, and reminds us of the many ways tenacity and faith can reshape the world.  This lively book will ride off with your heart and cycle through your memory for years to come.” –Raymond Arroyo,New York Timesbestselling author and host of EWTN'sThe World Over LiveFrom the Hardcover edition.", "related": ["B00DQ602K8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent two years in the pastorate and nearly five years in South Africa with a missionary society. Returning home he worked as a video systems engineer and technical writer/publisher before retiring to pursue a career as a writer and speaker. He has edited a magazine, written nearly 1,000 newspaper columns and features, and authored eight books.Ray graduated from RCC Schools (electronics), has a B.A. (general program) from the University of Waterloo, a B.G.B.S.

So imagine my surprise. . .when I realized this book was really unlike any I’d read. . . Julia is completely likable as a strong heroine. . .The writing was near flawless. . . pacing was perfect.”Anabella Johnson,Smashwords“What an absolutely adorable and enchanting tail! (oops, I mean tale). . . Julia as a heroine was sweet and spunky. . .The writing was excellent. . .The book category is “YA,” but as a thirty-something I can say that I enjoyed it and it definitely has cross-over appeal.”Karen *ReaderGirl*,Goodreads“I read this book in one sitting. I LOVED it!! The writing was clear and crisp, with short chapters and a fast pace. . .The plotline kept me guessing until the end. . .Fortunately there is a happy ending, and I have to admit that I didn’t see that resolution coming.”Stacy,Goodreads“The Ring of Leilani is a really cute mermaid story with an interesting twist. I loved the mythology as well as the fact that the story takes place in a foreign land, and we see a bit of another [culture]. . .There were some great action scenes (SHARKS!) and the chapters were pretty short and kept me turning the pages.”Samantha,Goodreads“I was utterly mesmerized by this sweet story of a young girl who is magically transformed into a mermaid and destined to rule over an underwater kingdom. . .As soon as I finished. . .I gave it to my 12 year old. . .and she loved it! From a girl who only cares about vampires, that is the highest of praise.”Claire Middleton,Smashwords“I found it refreshing that it seemed to break the current YA trend of love-triangles, sappy, weak-willed heroines, and girls who turn into mush at the first sight of a handsome boy. . . Julia is intelligent and strong, and while there is a cute boy involved, they work more as a team. . . love to read more!”Sophia Flynt,Smashwords", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the end, the story came out more sci-fi than fantasy, but I still consider this to be a good marriage of the two genres which, despite decades of being at odds with one another, I've always maintained have more in common than they have differences.

By “official,” I mean that these bindings were developed by PrimeSense. Obvious advantages of Java include object-orientation, cross-platform support, availability for free, and many people (including you, probably) knowing how to program with it. Most important, programming in Java gives you access to a massive number of libraries—for graphics, networking, and beyond—that can be linked to the Kinect without much effort. For example, I’ll demonstrate how to use the Java 3D graphics library and the Java binding for the OpenCV computer vision package.The main drawback of using the PrimeSense Java wrappers is their lack of documentation. As I explain in Chapter 1, I had to decompile the libraries’ JAR files, and work out the correspondences between the Java source and the somewhat better documented C++ OpenNI/NITE APIs. (This is why including Secrets in the book’s title isn’t too excessive.)A Wide Range of TopicsThis book covers programming topics not found elsewhere. I start off with the basics, of course, with chapters on depth, infrared, and RGB imaging, point clouds, skeletal user tracking, hand tracking, and gesture support. Moving beyond that, I cover several novel and unusual features, including the following:Kinect gaming based around a version of the classic Breakout video game.Controls for the Kinect motor, LED, and accelerometer, which are not part of the standard OpenNI API. In fact, their absence is often held up as a serious drawback of the API. It’s actually quite easy to add these capabilities using a custom-built USB driver.3D graphics programming in the point cloud and skeletal tracking examples, using Java 3D.A computer vision example that demonstrates how to link the Kinect to the popular (and powerful) OpenCV library.The creation of new body gestures (inspired by the FAAST system), which are not part of the limited NITE repertoire.A new type of GUI component controlled by hand gesturing, illustrated with three examples: a button, dial, and slider. These components are controlled without the help of mouse or keyboard.Depth with BrevityThis book describes a lot of complicated code but, unlike some rather hefty programming tomes, you won’t find all the code tediously printed on these pages. Instead, you can download it from the book’s website. In addition, I’ve been adding supplementary chapters to the website, including ones discussing speech recognition and the Kinect microphone array.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite (or maybe because of) this propensity for infusing her fiction with murder and mayhem, she still craves those happily-ever-after endings and the romance of everlasting love. Over the years she has discovered too that she enjoys delving into the deepest of human emotions—love and hate, bravery and cowardice, joy and despair—and how we, as human beings, relate to each other. Her greatest hope is to touch her readers’ hearts and help them experience the joy that only love can bring. Married to her college sweetheart and the mother of two grown sons, Leah is a native of the Central Jersey Shore but now makes her home in the Tidewater area of Virginia. Her published works include Surrender to Sanctuary (2010, The Wild Rose Press; 2012 Edward Allen Publishing), novella Adrienne’s Ghost (2012, Edward Allen Publishing), and the award-winning short story Letter from Christine.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 63.0}

We picked them up.  After several days of this, I left a note from the Lawn Gnomes that this is not nice.  They stopped leaving stuff outside their door.  A week later the idea about writing about a group of Gnomes came about.  I called my security post in the woods \"My Gnome Home.\"   And that started a flood of stories to flow.  I also write poems which I attribute to Alfred, my Alligator butler.   This also ties in with my volunteer work with the University of Texas at Arlington Texas as a volunteer digger at their dinosaur site for the past 3 1/2 years.   I love to read almost any type of story and my mind instantly transported to where the story took place.  I had time to read on my job but that had to stop because of the supervisor said so, so I took up pen and notebook and wrote my own story.  By the time I stopped, 4 months, I had 8 notebooks filled.   The story intrigued me and my mind, heart and soul really took over.  The \"story\" spoke to me in my dreams, just like the bones in the dino field.  I transplanted close friends in the book and I draw upon them.  Also the places where I have been and close encounters with Jesus Christ.    At the moment (17 years) we have lived in the same apartment in Euless Texas.  My wife and I spent 20 years in the Air Force and 8 years in Germany.  I traveled from Bodo, Norway to Algeria, Scotland to Northern Iraq in the First Gulf War.  I felt like a foreigner when we came back to the United States.    My wife, Deborah, of 36 years, have 2 children, Daniel and Sarah.  Both are married.  Danie and Eva have 3 wonderful boys.  Joseph, Jacob and Andrew.  Sarah and Paul have each other and their 2 dogs and 2 cats.    My wife works at our son's house as a full time Nanny for the three boys.  I on the other hand work in Forth Worth in Sundance Square as a Security Officer.  My hobbies take me to a Field of Bones 3 miles from home looking for dinosaur bones.  We have found a Hydrosaur, Crocodiles and turtles in this mix.  And da bonz talk to me.  Da Gnomes, Alfred all work together quite well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of his novels were first serialized in newspapers, and even today are still in print. In Poland, he is best known for his historical novels \"With Fire and Sword\", \"The Deluge\", and \"Fire in the Steppe\" (The Trilogy) set during the 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while internationally he is best known for Quo Vadis, set in Nero's Rome.

In the early 1880s he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trail. In 1890 he left the trail to try his hand at business, but the venture failed, so he turned his hand to gold-mining in Colorado and Nevada.

Writing is one of those and cooking is another. They both captured my interest and imagination at a very young age.The \"Mama's Legacy Series\" was a pleasure to create because it allowed me to tap into my interests and to publish cookbooks that my audience can use and enjoy time and time again.I began my love affair with cooking when I was very young. As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water; but, to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life.If I had my druthers, I would write all the time. In fact, that is pretty much what I do because I have reached a point in my life where it is now possible.In addition to the \"Mama Legacy Cookbook Series\" I have two other cookbooks, \"Cake Making Made Easy\" and \"Candy Making Made Easy.\" They are not only cookbooks; they provide detailed instructions on how to make cakes and candy. The cake book includes 60 delicious cake recipes and the candy book includes 17 starter recipes so the instructions can be applied immediately.I loved writing both instruction books, especially the candy book, because it brought back so many wonderful memories of candy-making with my family on those long summer nights when I was a young girl.", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.7273, "rating_total": 52.0}

[T]his is the most comprehensive, evidence-based, and theoretically integrated model of BPD that I have read.” (Journal of Analytical Psychology)“[A] fascinating and easy-to-read book, by an author with broad clinical experience and scholarship, who has been working with patients with BPD for over 30 years and has conducted an amazing number of empirical studies in this field. . . . The history of dissociation . . . is presenting in a fascinating way, intermingled with sketches of patients treated by the author. This blending of historical and clinical knowledge will make the book interesting for both researchers and clinicians. . . . I would recommend this volume to both psychiatrists and psychotherapists.” (Journal of Psychiatric Practice)“From PTSD and borderline personality to distancing procedures and emotional responses to trauma, this is packed with insights any analyst can use.” (Midwest Book Review)“With this fascinating book, Professor Russell Meares has created a magnificent piece of work, based on the premise that Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a 'failure of personal synthesis.' Understanding this integrative failure is essential in the treatment of patients suffering from this incapacitating biopsychosocial disorder. Starting with the pioneering studies of Hughlings Jackson, Pierre Janet, and William James, Meares thoroughly examines the theoretical, scientific, and clinical evidence for his model of BPD. The book's great value surpasses the domain of BPD proper and should attract a much wider readership than BPD specialists only.” (Onno van der Hard, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Psychopathology of Chronic Traumatization, Utrecht University, The Netherlands)“This highly readable, brilliant book is a true masterpiece in the contemporary study of psychopathology. Russell Meares's original and evidence-based account of the core of borderline personality disorder convincingly explicates its dissociative nature and its relationships with impulsivity, hindered mentalization, and traumatic memories. Meares offers clinicians a unique understanding of the borderline patient's affects and inner experience of self, thereby laying the foundation for highly effective therapeutic exchanges.” (Giovanni Liotti, M.D., APC School of Psychotherapy, Rome, Italy)“This excellent book, the culmination of a distinguished career, is vital for anyone seeking to understand the extreme mental suffering of what we currently call BPD. Drawing from neuroscience, historical scholarship, psychological research, and clinical observation, Russell Meares offers an erudite, compassionate account of the 'painful incoherence' at the heart of this disorder. By synthesizing both left- and right-brain data into a useful narrative, which is also a pleasure to read, he demonstrates on a grand scale the integrative process that nourishes us all and agonizingly eludes individuals with borderline psychologies.” (Nancy Williams, PhD, Rutgers Graduate School of Applied & Professional Psychology)", "related": ["B00BDB1GR6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By the time that writing had to be more than a hobby she'd married, had two kids, a career and turned thirty-five years old.       As The River Flows was the inspired by getting lost on a long drive in the country, on a foggy summer night. No cell phones, a little bit lost, a ghost story emerged in her mind. A whopper of a ghost story!      After relocating to California with her family,  Ms. Rubin completed her second novel, Reason To Kill, which is now published and available at Amazon.com and CreateSpace.com. She completed her third novel, Thicker Than Blood in 1996 and also a series of nonfiction stories for children, called Real Life. There are currently three completed titles in the series. Since then Ms. Rubin has completed her fourth novel, A Thousand Deaths.       Readers who enjoy mystery, horror, psychological drama, dark thrillers, or the supernatural will find what they like here. Could that happen? Who's to say it could not? Those are questions Ms. Rubin ponders, and then takes it from there as a starting point. There is always the promise of an ironic surprise ending that is packed with satisfaction if not a stroll into the sunset. Strange occurrences and extraordinary circumstances happen to ordinary people in every yarn Ms. Rubin spins.       A native of the Philadelphia area, Ms. Rubin has lived in California and Colorado, and currently lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with her family.

Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles stand particularly high in critical esteem, and Hugo is sometimes identified as the greatest French poet. Outside France, his best-known works are the novels Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris (also known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame). Though a committed royalist when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed; he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, and his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and artistic trends of his time.

Though Norway's highest courts have ruled no, the question is fraught. For many, it would appear that any murderer of 77 innocent civilians would be declared certifiably insane. But conflicting reports of Breivik's sanity have emerged since day one of the investigation into his brutal attacks, and the answer remains murky. Why does it even matter? Norway's justice system functions differently from America's. There, if someone is declared legally insane, they cannot be sentenced to the prison time that a sane criminal would be forced to serve. The overly humane courts show extreme leniency for society's unstable, preferring to rehabilitate them via sanitarium. The \"insane\" convict, therefore, spends time in a mental ward until he or she is declared ready to reenter society. In the case of Breivik, were he declared insane, he may have been released back onto Norwegian streets in a matter of a few years--a devastating reality for Norway's people, one in four of whom were directly affected by the twin attacks of July 2011.

InThe Mind of a Madman, Orange details the rollercoaster ride that was Breivik's trial, questioning whether the ultimate declaration of Breivik's lucidity was indeed the right one, or whether his sanity was sanitized to ensure his imprisonment.--Raya Jalabi", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 926851, "title": "The Mind of a Madman: Norway's struggle to understand Anders Breivik (Kindle Single)", "author": "Richard Orange", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

I could not imagine anyone living a life like Johnny Mack has, let alone survive the scrapes which were near on a life or death basis. He says it it as it was for him with no thrills added to spice the storyline up because there was need to. How he managed to get past his 29th birthday alive and intact was a miracle, but he used his street-wise skills to make it out of some tricky situations.I never thought gangsters could write a book let alone write one with utmost honesty, but Johnny mack has now had three published. I've read many a gangster tale but most tried to paint a picture that made them out to be top of their game. The difference with Johnny Mack is, he wrote his autobiographies himself without ghost writers being involved leaving his ego out of the equation so what the reader gets is pure honesty.I suspect Johnny could write crime stories all day long drawing from his past life experiences to make the story-lines believable because he's been there and done it all. Lets hope he continues to write fantastic crime stories that give avid crime readers continuous enjoyment.Great read and recommended to all crime buff's", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I like to fish offshore, but one or two\ndays offshore is about all I can handle on one trip to the beach. On a family\nvacation, I've got more days to fish and/or take my family fishing if I also\nfish inshore, near shore or on the pier, besides playing on the sugar-white\nbeach, soaking-up the rays and swimming in the beautiful blue water. I wanted\nto know where I could go, and what I could catch inshore, near shore, from the\nbank and from the pier. I had friends you'll read about in this book who fished\nall these locations. I also wrote this book to let people know that wind and\nweather often can prevent offshore captains from taking parties out, but\nthrough researching and writing this book, I've learned there always are some\nprotected waters or shelter to fish from in any kind of weather at the Coast.\nFor instance, on rainy days, I can fish under bridges, or on the pier, while\nsitting under one of the pavilions there, watching my rod. I wanted to know\nplaces where I could catch fish, regardless of the weather and the time of\nyear.Question: What's the\nbest way for me to get the most information about what's biting and all the\ndifferent ways and places I can fish while I'm at Alabama's Gulf Coast?Phillips: You solve most\nof these problems by buying this book. If you want to go offshore fishing, I\nstrongly recommend my other book, \"Alabama's\nOffshore Saltwater Fishing: A Year-Round Guide for Catching Over 15 Species of\nFish.\" To keep up with what's biting each week, go to my\ncolumn at \"What's Biting\" atgulfshores.com. As you get closer to the time\nyou want to fish, call some of the guides, and find out what they're catching.\nAlabama has great fishing inshore and offshore at the Gulf Coast, and I hope\nthis book will help you find places to fish, people to fish with and more fish\nthan you've ever caught in your life.", "related": ["B00BGIKBPY"], "rank": 835505, "title": "Alabama's Inshore Saltwater Fishing", "author": "John E.

His first book, Job Hunt Like A Predator: Building the Job Hunter of the Future, taps Jim’s business and recruiting experience to help readers turn the challenges of the job market into long-term career success. Jim was a highly paid headhunter and corporate recruiter in Silicon Valley, recruiting executives, software developers, professional services experts, marketing and public relations managers, among others. Jim worked with every department head throughout the organization, gaining an intimate familiarity with the internal operations of multinational, enterprise-class corporations.   He went on to co-found a land acquisition company servicing the world’s three top wind farm developers, where he served as Vice-President. Jim rejoined the business world after taking a 3 year time-out to counsel at-risk high school students in career selection and the development of marketable skills. To help his students, Jim developed a career assessment evaluator and a comprehensive career matrix with an approach of pulling rather than pushing the student to the goal. The tool helped foster a self-motivational dynamic that proved effective in launching students into successful careers. As a U.S. Army helicopter pilot, Jim logged more than 1000 hours flying combat missions in Vietnam. Prior to receiving his B.A. at Maharishi University of Management in Iowa, Jim was part of a relay track team that set a national junior-college record. Jim is currently launching a series of hiring and career skills workshops based on Job Hunt Like A Predator, which he will deliver at colleges and universities around the country. Job Hunt Like A Predator is the first volume in Jim’s three-part Empowerment Series, designed to develop men and women to their full, professional and personal potential.

A resident of Southern California since birth, except for his studies at the University of Miami in Florida, he initially intended to become a marine biologist. The story of how he arrived at a different calling is revealed in one of his stories of amazing sequential events described in Fingers in the Light. These events led to his decision to become a fine artist and commercial graphic designer—a profession that became life-long. During the 1970’s Jon also participated in a 9,500 mile run marathon, called “Liberty Torch” in which he placed a foot in each of the continental United States. He also taught math and coached swimming at a private school in Florida, as well as having traveled the world. Jon’s real story is about his quest to understand his true path and his place in life in relation to his amazing experiences of divine guidance and his God-given gifts and abilities, one of which is his award winning writing. This quest and all that he has learned through his experiences is now being told for the first time in his non-fiction books and now through his science fiction books. Jon’s love for and advocacy of marine mammals continues, as does his sensitivity to the natural world and its creatures. These avocations are explored in True Tails, which was his first award-winning autobiographical book and centers around his gift of coherent two-way communication with animals and other many-legged creatures. He also works for the preservation of marine mammals—his gently persuasive and rational arguments for ending the killing of whales and other sentient marine creatures are expressed in his popular website blog, The Whale People (www.thewhalepeople.com). And although his first books are of a non-fiction nature, Jon has began his debut as a science fiction writing with the release of his science fiction adventure called “Element 238 – The Search for Truth.” The first five volumes are now available in exclusive Kindle format, while the full six-volume series is now available in paperback. His author website: http://www.jhsoeder.com also has links to his short stories, both fiction and non-fiction. Jon lives in Ventura County. His books are widely available in softcover and e-book format.

Read against the backdrop of these better recognised types, so the Melchizedek type of Christ comes into its own.A great little book. I highly recommend it,and believe it opens the possibility for helpful dialogue specifically with Jewsih people as they consider the claims of Yeshua (Jesus).Review by Peter Sammons.

After living there for five eventful years, which provided plenty of material for Caron’s novels and short stories, the family returned to the UK in 2002.  Although Caron mainly writes in the mystery/crime genre she also enjoys dabbling in fantasy fiction.   Married with two grown up children and now living in Derbyshire, England, Caron previously worked as a railway ticket clerk, a classroom assistant, a secondhand bookshop assistant, an archivist, and a University administrator.   When not plotting how to kill people (for the books, of course!) Caron can often be found trawling the aisles of her local grocery stores in pursuit of everyday items with lethal potential.  Other interests include literary studies, history, cats, cooking, gardening, family tree research and chatting on Facebook.  She self-published her first eBook, Criss Cross, in 2013 and is currently writing a sequel, to be called Cross Check, which will be published as an eBook in the autumn of 2013.  The third volume of the Posh Hits Trilogy, Check Mate is due out in 2014.", "related": ["B00B887N44"], "rank": 3685, "title": "Criss Cross: Friendship can be murder", "author": "Caron Allan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As you probably have guessed, \"The Dino Detective\" is what we writers call a \"pen name\". I chose \"The Dino Detective\" rather than my own name for several reasons. The main reason is because I love to research and write about dinosaurs and it makes me feel like a detective as I hunt for information and clues for my next dinosaur book.  When not working on dinosaur books for kids, I am a school teacher, living in a small town in Canada, with over 30 years teaching experience. Most of my teaching years were spent teaching elementary school children which probably explains why I enjoy writing and publishing dinosaur books for kids, rather than for adults. As a child, and even into my adult years, the topic of dinosaurs has always fascinated me. I loved movies like \"Jurassic Park\" and any other movies that featured dinosaurs! My hope is that I can pass along some of that \"dino\" wonder and fascination through my  dinosaur books for kids. I sincerely want to thank you if you do decide to purchase any of my dinosaur books for kids, and hope you have as much fun reading it yourself or along with your children if you are a parent reading this, as I did creating these books. May the \"Dinosaur Force\" be with you!

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B0096CH78G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Patricia falls in love with the heroes she writes about each and every time she puts their lives down on paper. She loves sexy men and hates her villains more than the reader does. It helps to hate the bad guys. It makes the story so much richer. She realized a very long time ago that the world is filled with people who live diverse and amazing lifestyles and she tries to capture the beauty of such diversity in her writing.  Patricia has had a diverse career life. She’s been a jeweler, an AIDS hospice nurse and a “dreaded” mortgage broker. She hopes that the various walks of life she’s taken come out in her work.

From a young age he had a multitude of stories in his head ranging from Horrors and Thrillers to Fantasy and Science Fiction. A few years ago he decided to put pen to paper. The bestselling fantasy/epic The Rawn Chronicles Book One: the Orrinn and the Blacksword is his debut novel, followed by Book Two: The Warlord and the Raiders. Ceanneir's knowledge of Medieval Scottish History, and his experiences in the H. M. Forces, has aided him to write the fantasy series and fulfil his dream of becoming a published author. He started writing after leaving the army in 1998 and has completed all ten books of the Rawn Cycle.

Gatlin patches up Grace's broken arm, but because he can't resist teasing her about the accident, Grace vows, whenever possible, to avoid his company. Then on a visit to his office one day, Grace interrupts Gatlin while he is in the midst of tending to a wounded member of the infamous Bonney Boys' Gang. To protect her, Gatlin pretends Grace is his wife, only to have the Bonney Boys take them both hostage and then later abandon them in a deserted mountain cabin. Forced into cooperating with each other, Grace and Gatlin find themselves revising their first impressions as they search for a way home. The fourth book in Brown's Land Rush series brings her gently appealing historical romances, set in small-town Oklahoma in the late nineteenth century, to a charming conclusion.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

I was born in Page, Arizona, practically on the Navajo Reservation, and raised in Idaho with my several siblings. I began writing stories when I was about three. I spent most of my childhood living the adventures described in my books. I earned a Bachelor’s of English from Brigham Young University–Idaho and a Master’s of English from Brigham Young University. Aspiring to be a renaissance man, I’ve worked as a lawn mower, a concrete pourer, a street preacher, a meta-physicist, a typographer, a graphic designer, a usability designer, a warrior poet, and even an English teacher. I also suffer from chronic somnia. WHAT KIND OF A NAME IS J? No, I’m not trying to copy J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. J really is my first name—my whole first name. Nope, not J-A-Y. Not J with a period. (Abbreviating it makes it longer.) It starts and ends with J. Just J. In fact, if you throw a pen at a paper from at least five feet away, it nearly always spells my name. “But what kind of a name is J?”—you’re still asking. Well, I’ll tell you. There was once a man named Melvin J. Ballard (whose middle name was Joseph, but he liked to abbreviate it). My grandpa was named J Ballard Washburn in honor of this man. But he just got the J (without the period). I was named after my grandpa, and I just got his J. Which is nice.

There is a tinge of\nsorrow, which is a reality when it comes to the lives of any soldier's family.Children's stories are the best when they have something educational and\ninteractive for young readers and when they portray a concept. The illustrations\nin this book are bright and full of color. The educational concept of\nintroducing a child to what is meant by a 'soldier' and his duties is well\nexpressed.On the whole, it is a beautiful book, ideal to be kept in school and children's\nlibraries. The book will make a good bedtime story and read-aloud story book.", "related": ["B00BQ1YEJU"], "rank": 2207810, "title": "Daddy, My Hero eBook", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book starts from the time the twins are being formed and born, and continues as they grow up. It shares their likes and dislikes, their similarities and their differences. Author Yael Manor allows the reader to better understand the thought processes of the twins, especiallyEthan whokeeps pointing and saying a word they are unfamiliar with. They can't seem to figure out what he is referring to. This illustrates how it is with each parent and how they hear their little one trying to say something - a word they are trying to form, yet not pronounced correctly, thus creating a hard time for clear understanding. It is a challenging yet fun duty to explore the mind of a young child to better understand what they are trying to say.Illustrator Anahit Aleqsanyan does a wonderful job of painting a picture of what is going on and makes the story come to life with clear and precise illustrations. Following the life of young Ethan and Emma is enjoyable and entertaining. This would be a fun book for parents to read and share with their young child, especially if they have twins. This is a fine resource for parents with twins and one they will enjoy as well.", "related": ["B007S63Q00"], "rank": 791604, "title": "Children Books: Ethan and Emma are Twins (Bedtime Stories For Children)(Picture Books) (Twins Stories Book 1)", "author": "Yael Manor", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Constable Richard Nottingham has still not recovered from the terrible tragedy that took his wife and daughter the previous year. But as spring turns to summer, Nottingham has no choice but to focus on his job. A young man from the country asks the constable to help find his sister, who’s run away to Leeds, but before Nottingham can launch a search, both the young man and his sister are found dead. Then Nottingham’s old nemesis, Tom Finer, returns to Leeds from London, claiming he’s given up his criminal ways. Nottingham knows better, but the trick is to catch Finer when he commits his next crime. After another body is found, Nottingham and his deputies are stretched to the limit, and then stretched still further, when the school that Nottingham’s daughter, Emily, has opened for the poor is hit first by vandalism and then by murder. Evoking authentic sights, sounds, smells, and customs of eighteenth-century England, Nickson offers up an moving and gripping thriller that will have fans of historical mysteries hooked. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B00CY1EBIA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although it would be interesting to say I spend my time exploring exotic destinations and drinking wine from barrels in Tuscany, that is not the case.  I live in the real world.  Currently, my days are spent working in the ever exciting world of bookkeeping.  Night time for me does not mean breaking into the Smithsonian to steal the hottest work of art to sell on the black market.  In fact, the only work of art I’ll see will be created by one of my awesome kids while they’re doing anything possible to keep from getting in bed on time.  As with every other small town girl, I have dreamed of breathtaking adventures and schmoozing with the elite.  I actually managed to make it about two thousand miles and a few months before realizing that the big city lights are better left to big city girls and my wild imagination.  No adventure is as fulfilling as being wrapped in the strong arms of my love while surrounded by the laughter and arguing of our not so little ones. R. L.

His notoriety precedes his introduction, a man reputed to capture and crush hearts on a whim; yet one can't help but fall in love with him.And just like most scoundrels, Con treads a fine line between adoration and scandal, creating a pleasant contradiction of seductive prowess and affable charisma meant to knock females off balance, their pulse triple time.I like my heroes brooding; protected by self-imposed walls of charming conversation and impeccable personality. I write my heroines strong-minded with determination to destroy those same walls and uncover a deep capacity for love. I have no doubt you'll feel this way about Constantine and Isabelle when you read their story.Label me a hopeless romantic, in love with happily ever after and forever daydreaming. I don't mind.

It's psychological tension at its best,\nprobing the motivations of violence and its birth and feeding. It shows how\nvulnerability can lead to danger and, in turn, how surviving danger can\nultimately create newfound strength, determination, and vision. And it offers\nplenty of moments which readers can readily identify with, from Nora's initial\ndisappointments in love to how and why she comes to feel more connected to\nDane. Ultimately it's these connections that lie at the heart of the thriller\npackage, inviting readers to consider the sources of dangerous attraction and\nits eventual results. As Nora's odyssey moves swiftly from initial magnetism to\ndeeper discoveries, chapters present the rationales she employs to overlook\nwarning signs that something's very wrong. As Dane descends into a world of violent manipulation of women (and there are\ngraphic scenes, be forewarned - but G. Nykanen pulls back from outright shock,\nemploying good taste to set the scenes of depravity without going over the top\nin describing sordid specifics), he comes closer and closer to moving from\ntorture to outright murder. What will stop him, and what will keep Nora safe? And will Nora rise to the\ncall when her friend Lucy falls under Dane's spell? It's a series of escalating\nencounters for all involved, providing a solid story packed with psychological\ninsights on motivation, action, and purpose; all wrapped up in a thriller that\nkeeps its mystery right up to its unpredictable conclusion which offers a\nsatisfying counter to the darkness that permeates much of the story. -D.

In 1969 she moved to England where she met her husband David. Together they established a clothing importing company. Their business gave them the opportunity to travel and work in the sub-Continent and the Far East. A large part of their working life was spent in Bangladesh, where they helped to establish a school in the rural part of the country, training young people in trades such as sign-writing, electrical work, and repair of computers and televisions.
