The strength of Lane’s perfectly cadenced prose may bring to mind Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy and, inevitably,The Bible. There is a deep wisdom in this book and I cannot recommend it highly enough.”— Richard Bachman, A Different Drummer Books“Lane’s exquisite craftsmanship is on display… particularly his unerring instinct for images that wound and enlighten in equal measure.”—Globe and Mail“The violence and anger [are] matched only by the sublime radiance of the prose….

Chet and Natalie are forced to go undercover as football player and cheerleader to find the connection between a mysterious stomach ailment, bubble gum, and the water boy who didn't make the team. As in the previous books, Chet's sarcastic wit makes the story a great choice for reluctant older readers who are fans of Jon Scieszka's \"Time Warp Trio\" series (Viking). The humor makes this a jollier read than E. A. Hass's \"Incognito Mosquito\" series (Random; o.p.). Younger audiences might miss sophisticated lines such as \"You can't play dumber- without a lobotomy.\" However, anyone will laugh at the slapstick situations. Kids will also appreciate Chet's constant desire for foods such as \"greasy horsefly burritos\" or \"Lice Krispie treats.\" Black-and-white line drawings appear every few pages, depicting funny animal characters with exaggerated human characteristics.Debbie Whitbeck, West Ottawa Public Schools, Holland, MICopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Job boards don't\nseem to be paying off for me, and networking is a slow process. I need to do\nsomething that'll revive my search. How much faith do you put in taking the initiative\nand reaching out with e-mail letters to land a job? And what is the difference\nbetween a \"broadcast letter\" and a \"letter of interest? --\nB.Q.S. Word games. Career advisers use\nvarying terms for self-marketing, unsolicited direct mail, whether it is\npresented via e-mail or on paper. The big differences between broadcast and\ninterest letters are merely time and terminology. Self-marketing direct mail in the 20th century was\nalmost always called \"broadcast letters,\" while the same breed today\nis often referred to as \"letters of interest\" or \"inquiry\nletters.\" By any name, you send these letters to big numbers of potential\nemployers with whom you have no connection. Or you may send them to recruiters\nwho specialize in your function, industry or career level. Competent campaign. To stack the odds in\nyour favor, you have to do more than write a wimpy \"I-I-I\" letter (I\ndiscovered your company, I'm looking for this, I want that -- and other\nexpressions reflecting your hiring hopes from your perspective). Instead,\nswitch mentalities with the busy individuals who read your letter by\nremembering this five-word formula: TELL THEM WHY THEY CARE. You may be a whiz\nat finance, office management, whatever -- but so what? Make the profit\nconnection for readers -- tell them why they care. After\nwriting a powerhouse letter, your next task is to get it to the right\ncomputers. Compiling a list of leads is a real time buster. A company called\nCustom Databanks can help. Custom Databanks is the premier distribution vendor,\nlong used by professional resume writers and career coaches. Now the company is\nexpanding to serve individual job seekers. For $9.99 each, you can download an e-book\ndirectory that lists hundreds of search firms in your field or locale; each\nlisting includes the data you need -- firm name, key contacts, e-mail and\npostal address, phone number, description, industry and position specialties,\nwhether retained or contingent, and minimum salary of assignments. The\ne-books are drawn from Custom Databanks' regularly cleaned digital vault of\nmore than 15,000 selected industries, positions, cities and states.  The e-book directories are available on Amazon.com\nand BarnesandNoble.com. They are designed to be read on Kindle or Nook\ne-readers. If you don't have an e-reader, both Amazon and Barnes & Noble\noffer free apps that allow you to use your computer, tablet or smart phone to\nread the directories. You can sample before you buy. For more information on\nsaving time, money and sanity to proactively distribute your resume, visit\ncustomdatabanks.com/e-book-directories-2.... (E-mail career questions for possible use in this\ncolumn to Joyce Lain Kennedy at jlk@sunfeatures.com; use \"Reader\nQuestion\" for subject line. Or mail her at Box 368, Cardiff, CA 92007.)  From the RileyGuide.com, the premier directory\nof employment and career information sources and services on the Internet: Special Announcement: Directories of Executive\nSearch FirmsCustom Databanks has just released their eBook\nDirectories of Executive Search Firms for the Kindle or Nook ereaders. These\nebooks are available to you at the cost of $9.99 each ...The eBooks are available\nfrom Amazon or Barnes & Noble and you can look at a free sample before you\nbuy. Don't have a Kindle or Nook?

This is a competitive product to Kennedy's, but\nin many cases they may provide more contact names for each firm listed. Select\nDownload Data from the left menu to search their directories of Retained or\nContingency search firms by industry or position specialty, salary range\nhandled, and cities/states/regions (US and Canada). They will tell you how\nmany records have been found and the cost before you buy, but here's another\ninteresting feature. They'll tell you how many firms have email addresses, fax\nnumbers, or merely postal addresses. You can buy whichever list you want based\non your needs (but I suggest you don't limit yourself to those firms with email\naddresses.) You are buying a data file that can easily be imported into Excel\nor any word processor for mail-merge and campaign management.

Starting out at 15 he dropped out of high school and the first thing he bought was an (electric) guitar at 16. Taking lessons in classical guitar over four years on an electric guitar was quite unusual, more so for his teacher. At the age of 20, Rob bought his first of many pianos, and it's the piano that has stuck with Rob for the last 30 years.  Rob settled on a career in music but writing and poetry would always hold a strong influence over him. After many years study to become a composer and with seven years study in compositions and orchestration, writing and poetry became stronger than his love of music.  Rob has had his writing published in a variety of newspapers, magazines, books and online. As a poet Rob's writings all have a distinct style, you can feel his poetical influences in his prose and you will find that all of Rob's words have a way of getting under your skin - in a good way.Some of Rob's favourite authors are Patrick White, H.G. Wells, Vladimir Nabokov, and Ayn Rand. H.G. Wells is a particular influence on Rob; his ideas of social justice lie at the heart of a lot of Rob's writings and thoughts. Along with the great inventive and dramatic ideas that Wells brought to his writing, Rob's aim is to bring not only the dramatic but that inner world of seldom spoken feeling and wants out onto the page.Rob is compiling a book of his short stories; he has a short novel Park Street up on Amazon, along with a sampling of his short prose and verse novels. His next book,Paintedto be released this year and next year 2012 a dramatic espionage story,The Disease.Rob is also compiling a book of short stories in collaboration with over 20 writers, titledThe Book of Fascination.If you like to find out more about Rob and his works, you will find links to his blog and various other sites on his Amazon Author page.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though surrounded by the evils of the street life he always found an escape in music in literature. Music and books were a fantasy world he could escape to when the pressures of the real world became overbearing. At a young age he began to pen poems, songs, and short stories. This love of writing, and ability to do so, developed over the years and at the age of 21, he began his writing career. After two attempts between the ages of 21 and 24 he figured he had finally gotten it right. The death of his close friend motivated the writer to become more reflective and introspective with his work. This friend, Kareem Williams, became the spirit of the protaganist as well as other characters in his first release GET IN, GET OUT. Once released, realizing the readers may have fallen in love with the character Lexi, the fiance of Marquise, he decided to pen LOVE AND THE GAME, which served as an extended version to GET IN, GET OUT for those who wanted to know what Lexi's fate would be after losing Marquise and being forced to fend for herself. After the critically acclaimed LOVE AND THE GAME, Saleem finished a manuscript he had begun about human trafficking. in CRYING FOR TEARS, Saleem hoped to highlight the parallels between young women who are lured by money to prostitute in an urban setting and the horrific global trade of women for the same reason. Saleem then went on to release the SINCERELY YOURS series, which were anthologies written in order to bring readers closer to the author. SINCERELY YOURS II was released May 12th and another novel titled G.O.D. is slated for release some time in 2012.", "related": ["B008EK92MU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2009, his fan audio drama Star Wars - Codename: Starkeeper was a finalist for a Parsec award at Dragon*Con in Atlanta, Georgia, and was honored with six awards by the fan website Starwarsfanworks.com. He is a podcaster, having hosted The Adventures of Indiana Jim since 2006 (though under a few different show names), and The 49ers Fancast since 2009. He is an amateur voice actor, lending his voice to many different volunteer productions across the internet, and plays several different musical instruments, mostly the stringed variety. In the past he has been a stage actor, singer, arranger, conductor and band leader. He also dreams of one day improving his golf game enough to qualify for the U.S. Open as an amateur, but as his writing will attest, he has a vivid imagination. He makes his home in Southern Indiana with his wife and three children.", "related": [], "rank": 3699454, "title": "Firefight at Overwatch Command (WARS", "author": "Jim Perry", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is the relationship between Trinity and Francine. Trinity has always had a clear head, been responsible and down to earth, but whenever she's with Francine she finds herself swept up into Francine's craziness. This time Francine's craziness brings her to Club Vampire. *** Please note*** By the request of my readers a second Night at Club Vampire book, \"Night at Club Vampire 2: Nigel\" has been written and now available. (A 39k word novella)This first novelette was originally intended to be a stand alone book. There is no need to read the second book to enjoy the first and vice versa. The focus of book 2 is on Nigel, the club owner. However, you will find the main characters of this book within the second. Is Franny and Trinity still with the mystery men they met at the club or were their encounters simply one night stands? Where are the characters now; five months after that amazing night? These answers will be unveiled in the second book.I thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you enjoy a night at Club Vampire!All the best,Elixa", "related": ["B00K97O622"], "rank": 1308943, "title": "A Night At Club Vampire", "author": "Elixa Everett", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I get bored because I know how the story is going to end ahead of time.I make notes as I go and \"fly by the seat of my pants\" from there. I have a basic mental idea of what I'm going to do but nothing is written in stone. My first book was an expansion of a short story I wrote many moons ago. (That short story is in my free book at Smashwords \"Strange Short Tales\" and titled \"Diary of a Grave Mistake.\" There's a stark contrast in how the short ends compared to the book.. but it's a good stand alone short story that will not ruin the ending of \"The Beginning. (Whispering Pines Book One.)\"My second book in the Whispering Pines series (The Revenge) was a pure spin off of the first.. but while writing Revenge, I started a sub plot that kept growing until it was distracting from the main plot. I ripped it out and that became my third book, \"Rebel Gold.\" While writing Rebel Gold, another sub plot grew too large and that became my fourth book, \"Cotton Tears.\" (etc etc on down to book six, \"The Garden Patch\" which started me down the yellow brick road to book seven that is under construction, tentatively titled \"Permuda Grass.\" (An intentional misspelling of Bermuda grass, but it's how southern children pronounce it.)As for my forte.. I've never been comfortable writing mystery/fiction.. or horror.. or humor.. although all three genres I've used in print with good success. If readers are looking for something under \"Wells Brand\" then it would be plain, rated PG, fun to read books and stories and a rather wide berth for genre.

When I was a kid I wrote stories and drew pictures for them and stapled them together to make books. My mother recently showed me one of these little books apparently based on my older brother’s Dungeons & Dragons gaming.  When I was 14 I wrote a sci fi novel. When I was 15 I wrote a fantasy novel. I set them aside and never looked at them again. Then I grew up and had some adventures and became disillusioned about most everything except my dream of being a novelist. In 1997 at the age of 25 I started writing again. Now it’s 2011 and I am working on my eighth novel. No publisher was ever interested in me. I stopped beating my head on that door in 2004. But rejection from people who could never care about my dream only emboldened me. I began self publishing my fantasy fiction in 2005. That was before being an indie author was cool. Despite relentless obscurity and general disrespect, I was always encouraged by a steady trickle of sales and the occasional kind comment from a reader.  To be honest, being a novelist is always a struggle. I get criticized in public and don’t get called by any movie producers, but also every day someone somewhere buys my novels and that amazes me. I’m humbled by my readers. I will always do my best to craft stories worthy of them. I love the stories I write, and sometimes other people like them too.

When Maggie's lover, L.A. homicide detective Mike Flint, tells her that Pisces has been murdered, she promises to stay out of the police investigation but determines to find out who the girl was and how her family had lost track of her. The parents of a little girl who disappeared on a family outing 10 years earlier claim Pisces was their missing child, but Maggie and Mike identify the dead girl as the daughter of a wealthy Long Beach playboy. More murders occur while the police search for the killer and Maggie investigates possible connections between the two families. Hornsby gives the readers plenty of action and adult sex in this well-plotted tale that deftly mines suspense from the fears and vulnerabilities of single parents Maggie and Mike--and of her readers.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One probably assumes that states of feeling (states such as pain, pins and needles, and tingling) exist in all parts of the universe that are human beings, and may also believe that such states exist in non-human animals too. It is an open question whether such states of feeling can arise out of the interactions of stuff which is wholly devoid of feeling. Many people assume that such states only exist in certain animal life-forms because they find the idea that such states could pervade the universe (existing in tables, stones, atoms, etc) to be implausible. Jonathan Bloom attempts to make this idea more plausible and to thereby remove the need to give an intelligible account of how such states could emerge from the non-feeling universe.CONTENTSPrefaceIntroduction1   'Physical Stuff' & Knowledge2   The 'Certainty' of Descartes3   Anthropocentricism versus Anthropomorphism4   The Torch & the Brain5   The Objectiveness of Consciousness6   The Labelling of Feelings7   The Fallacy of 'Objects'8   Conclusions", "related": [], "rank": 3113369, "title": "Physicalism & Feelings: An exploration of the nature of the universe", "author": "Jonathan Bloom", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When black City Councilman Green is found shot to death in an empty lot, Wager gets the case. He also gets pressure, some of it dumb, from a new lieutenant. Wager, still mourning his dead lover Jo, must also cope with a new partner, Lester Stubbs. During the murder investigation Wager finds that Green, a successful furniture dealer, was apparently loved by everyone. As racial tensions in Denver rise Wager hears of a Council zoning change that's \"a little bit irregular,\" which he knows is \"like being just a little bit pregnant.\" And then there's the matter of Green's white mistress. Burns has written a first-rate procedural that includes a wonderful cast of characters, a sharp look at \"progress\" and the different, subtle brands of racism (Wager is half Chicano), police politics and a stunning riot scene. The rich, satisfying plot is propelled by Burns's smooth style. A must for procedural fans or anyone interested in big-city life.

Bell is a writer of both fiction and non-fiction works. He is a retired criminal investigator who spent years conducting numerous investigations resulting in successful prosecutions. He is also a cancer survivor and as with his professional experience, has committed his experiences to books on the topics. Born in Dearborn, Michigan, Mr. Bell served in the U.S. Navy in the early 1960’s participating in crisis operations in both the Dominican Republic and Cuba. After discharge he spent 14 years in the Dearborn Police Department in patrol, undercover narcotics and SWAT assignments before moving on to his final career stop in corrections in Colorado. Beginning in prisons, he promoted to the rank of captain before taking a position as a criminal investigator. There he specialized in crimes perpetrated by convicts from within prison and frequently worked under cover to build cases against those who attempted to contract the murders of persons outside the prison. Mr. Bell is the author of several articles featured in trade publications such as the FBI Law Enforcement Journal; Chief of Police Magazine and on the backup.com website. His technical opus, “Practical Criminal Investigations in Correctional Facilities” is regarded as the textbook for the highly specialized area of conducting criminal investigations within prisons. Other works include a short story about surviving prostate cancer; an historical fiction novella about a character involved in the U.S. Civil War and a pair of novels, fictional thrillers which make liberal use of his first-hand professional experiences to enrich the action sequences.

Frank Standish is a local hero, a retired race car driver and owner of a popular local bar, The Bull. Increasingly frustrated with Mayor Cornelius' disregard for the rule of law and his overbearingly paternalistic desire to addle Fulton Springs with endlessly intrusive regulations, he finally decides to take a stand and challenge Cornelius in the next election. Much of the narrative recounts Frank's steadfast resistance to Cornelius' attempts to strengthen his grip on political power, as the incumbent aggrandizes his position at the expense of those he cynically purports to represent. A political neophyte, Frank not only battles against an entrenched, amoral administration, but also against the town's accumulated lethargy, increased by years of mistreatment. The recognizable and predictable crux of the story never loses its speedy stride ... Weber runs up and down the bandwidth of small-government advocacy: eminent domain abuse, gun control, encroachments of the environmental lobby, nanny state proscriptions (the mayor bans the use of salt), campaign finance corruption and even the legalization of marijuana. Top marks for sheer thoroughness, but readers might tire of the incessant evangelizing. An upbeat, breezy read ... could just as easily be a treatise on the virtues of limited government.", "related": [], "rank": 1659477, "title": "The Bull", "author": "Matthew Weber", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Prodded by Megan and her boss, Detective Inspector Scumble, the authorities race to organize a search while Eleanor uses her contacts in a nearby village to identify hidden smugglers’ caves. Following their rescue, the investigation turns to finding those who left them to die.

My sister was born a week later and I was almost 6. My mother never talked about his injuries or the war either. Only when she died did we find his love letters to her. This book should help all \"war orphans\" fill in some of the blanks. -- Anonymous\" This novel is clearly authored for those who prefer knowing how letters can unlock the door to revealing a person's feelings. Bruce Brodowski's book \"The Dad I Never Knew\" has captured that missing part of personal need for him as well as others who lived a fatherless life because of war. This book offers a new twist on the military and a soldier's deep feeling for his wife and child\"   -- MWGGenre: History Title: The Dad I Never Knew Author: Bruce Brodowski In the glorious rush to take up arms in noble causes by necessity there is little thought to more than the matter at hand. Future generations are the reasons to strive for victory. Most warriors do return home to carry on raise families, but there are so many who are born and begin to grow not knowing the men who gave them life. This book is about one of those boys and his quest to learn what he could of the man whose hopes and dreams he carries into the present.Mr. Brodowski is actually one of the more fortunate ones in that he has a wealth of letters exchanged between his father and his mother. These are skillfully interwoven with a historical timeline. It is this timeline that helps the reader to achieve a sense of place in the events. In hindsight we know that the war was definitely winding down and was soon to end. At the time though there was hope, but the fighting kept going with the Germans fighting on in desperation as their homeland was at long last feeling the privations of conflict.This book by Bruce Brodowski is carefully and articulately written. The reader shares along with the author his quest to know the man and to make sense of the life the son was destined to follow. Mr. Brodowski was definitely not alone in his experience but he has been most fortunate in finding a personal history upon which to draw. This reviewer hopes that some of those many others in Mr. Brodowski's situation will take heart and find some pride in those that gave so much for them.This book is available through any bookseller and comes highly recommended by this reviewer as a part of history that should not be forgotten. -- Reviewer: John Helman, M.A., Allbooks Reviews.", "related": [], "rank": 2962299, "title": "The Dad I Never Knew, A War Orphan's Search for Inner Healing eBook", "author": "Bruce Brodowski", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Inspired by the style of some of her favorite authors: Adriana Trigiani, Nora Roberts, and writers who add home and heart and those who keep it 'steamy', her writing began in the middle of the night in 2003. Her ideas usually come from a song and she builds a story from there. She calls this 'the sound-track of her life'. Sprinkled through her stories are humor and sadness based on experiences shared with family and friends. Those who have read her stories, and know her, tell her they 'see and feel' her experiences with them in the words on the pages. Rock and Roll Never Forgets (Aug '12) is really her first work, 'her heart'. \"It's the first one I wanted published, but I didn't know how to 'get there'.

Because she is a suspect, the company won't pay the claim. After a year, the police still haven't made an arrest, so Tony reinterviews the suspects and sorts through their alibis and motives. After he eliminates various suspects from consideration, he begins to devise an alternate motive and suspect for the crime. Complicating matters, Tony's girlfriend has just dumped him, and his cousin's son arrives in Austin to stay with him. Another subplot has Tony investigating his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, who appears to be a con man preying on lonely, well-off women. Plot twists and a likably persistent main character make for an entertaining addition to this too-little-known series.

Myrick expands the landscape of the first book, adding an underground city ruled by a mournful monarch, a lone cottage guarded by a blind old man and snow-covered plains that frame the novel's climactically bloody conclusion. Overall, the novel successfully presents a complex world through artfully visual scenes and multiple perspectives, with enough twists and turns to dazzle fantasy fanatics. Highly recommended for genre buffs and newbies alike, this adventure carries readers through a land of magic, laughter and tears. --KIRKUS REVIEWS (Starred Review)", "related": [], "rank": 1914391, "title": "Mark of the Blooded (Kingdom of Graves Book 2) eBook", "author": "Leland Myrick", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I believe that with the increased coverage, combined with the attractive layout and writing style, this text will be very well accepted by the staff and students of Chemistry Departments, particularly in the UK.\"         --Mike Hird, University of Hull\"I was particularly impressed by the way in which the physical basis of key mathematical equations was presented and discussed in clear simple language. The authors adopt the approach taken by myself in my lectures, in which I attempt to convey to the students the sense that an equation is not only a jumble of arcane symbols but contains a clear meaning which can be subjected to a clear and concise explanation and interpretation.\"         --Mike Lyons, Trinity College, Dublin\"Where it is superior, is in its ability to actually teach the students rather than just lecture to them.\"         --James Barker, University of Kingston\"It is such a great book and I am sure that my OUP rep is sick of me calling her and raving about it! Chapter 13 is stunning-it is so well written and it so easy to teach from.  The authors have obviously been involved in chemistry education.\"         --Mark Ellison, Australian National University\"This is a book that shines out amongst so many other graduate texts in the field of chemistry. It does not try to encompass the whole of a degree course in a single text; rather it addresses the specific needs of the first year undergraduate. It does so in a refreshingly open and 'familiar way'.\"         --Reviews, The Higher Education Academy UK Physical Sciences Centre\"In view of its quality and advantageous price this book is especially recommended to its target audience, as well as everyone for whom an up-to-date introduction to chemistry is suitable.\"         --CLB Chemie in Labor und Biotechnik, April 2010\"A simple uncluttered layout, amply illustrated with contemporary 'real world' examples, clearly demarcates different sections. The book positively blooms; it is beautifully illustrated and operates on many levels without feeling cluttered, juggling chemistry theory, equations and history in a manner that enriches rather than overloads the reading experience\"         --Ewan Miller, Second-year Medicine Undergraduate, University of Aberdeen\"This is the only textbook I will need to use for all of first year due to the well explained, detailed content.\"         --Kirsty Purchase, Student, University of St Andrews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Once I saw where the story was going, I loved the idea of a\nghost being haunting the reincarnation of his wife, it got even better\nwhen I decided that it should be his wife that killed him.Q:  What inspired you to writeSpiritus?A:\n I actually live pretty close to Corydon, so I would pass all of these\namazing old houses and I couldn't help but think about the people that\nhad lived there over the years and what their lives must have been\nlike.  Little by little, I started getting this idea for a Civil War\nhero that came back from the war changed and bitter.  It wasn't long\nafter that I came up with his wife who was also changed by the war that\nended up in her own back yard.  I tried to imagine these two people,\ntrying to return to normal life, and how it could lead to tragedy.Q:  What is your favorite ghost story? What about favorite ghost movie?A:  Without a doubt, my favorite ghost story isLasherby Anne Rice!  Her words are like poetry and the story is just amazing.  I don't really have a favorite ghost movie, but mySpiritusnovels deal with a love that can survive beyond death and one of my favorite movies of all time,Bram Stoker's Dracula, has that same theme.Q:  What other authors do you read?A:\n I love all things Anne Rice, but I'm also a fan of J.K. Rowling,\nStephen King, and so many of the new indie authors!  There is so much\ntalent out there now!Q:  If you were stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD...What would they be?A:  For the book, I would have to sayThe Witching Hourby Anne Rice. For the CD, it could be anything from P!nk. As far as the DVD, I would have to sayGone With The Wind. Now I have a question, if I'm on a deserted island, how am I going to listen to the CD or watch the DVD?Q:  Describe your writing in 3 words.A:  Dark. Romantic. Horror.Q:  How do you come up with characters names?A:\n As crazy as it sounds, my character names are just meant to be, even if\n I don't realize it at the time.  For my heroine, I needed a name that\nwould be possible in the Civil War era and today.  I played around with a\n few and settled on Becca, so no big story there, but for Alastor, I\njust always loved that name.  I was over halfway through the first book\nbefore I learned that Alastor means \"vengeful spirit\"...How great is\nthat? Q:  Do you have a favorite character or one you most identify with?A:  I am so in love with Alastor.  A ghost with a temper that speaks so beautifully...What's not to love?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was Manning’s ability to paint the complex  relationship between gender and power with wit and sensitivity in her  wartime novels that makes her an important 20th century writer.” —Lauren  Elkin,The Daily Beast“Two qualities are special toFortunes of War—the wideness of its panorama and its author’s temerity. No experience, civilian or military, fazes Manning. Equally at home inEastern  Europe and the Middle East, she manages to convince the reader that the  pageantry and misery of the world are as mutual as her view of them is  trustworthy.” —Howard Moss,The New York Review of Books“The finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer.” —Anthony Burgess “Atour de force...a picture of the Middle East in wartime that we shall want to look at again and again.” —The Listener “How many Americans who have read Barbara Pym, Beryl Bainbridge, or   Iris Murdoch have ever heard of Olivia Manning? Yet she is one of the   most gifted English writers of her generation.... Nobody has written   better about World War II—the feel of fighting it and its dislocating   effects on ordinary, undistinguished lives.” —Eve Auchincloss,The New York Times “Olivia Manning’s greatest achievements are the Balkanand Levantnovels.   In these she handles her daunting wealth of material with great   artistic dexterity and an admirable sense of proportion that at the same   time never reduces. Nor does her concern to understand public events   impair her analytical comprehension of the private lives of her   people.... Olivia Manning wrote as courageously about death and the fear   of death—in combat, in accident, through disease, through age—as any   novelist in our language this century.” —Paul Binding,New Statesman “But also the unobtrusiveness of this unforgettable book is a function   of Olivia Manning’s style. At first one wonders, ‘Why doesn’t she write   more?’ for this is a very austere and self-denying manner. But  gradually  we become aware that she doesn’t need to ‘write,’ to make  things up to  beguile us, because what she has so powerfully observed is  true, and she  has set it down without fuss.” —Richard Dyer,The Boston Globe “These books are clearly among the very best fiction about the Second   World War.

A perusal of the current job listings showed a need for a Bachelor's Degree. Apparently, 30+ years' work experience wasn't enough anymore. During her first English Composition class, she had to write some short essays and papers. She found a knack and a love for writing. As a result, she started writing essays about things she was thinking about and posted them to a personal blog. Soon, the essay writing led to poetry writing. Around this same time, she came across a deck of oracle cards by Cheryl Harnish. These cards contained fractal designs. Her interest was peaked and she started researching fractals. In the course of her research, she came across a free software program, downloaded it, and started creating her own fractals. She is excited to see where this part of her journey takes her. It is her hope that the words she writes and shares touches the hearts and souls of those who read them.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also produce all my own illustrations (with one or two exceptions) through a technique involving photographing toys as models and matting them against a photograph of a background that I have taken myself and then converted using special software into the style I desire. I also produce all my own covers using similar techniques. My Poetry is accessible, interesting, unpretentious and poignant. My YA novels are thoughtful, timely and exciting for young people to read. My short stories are engaging and unique. I have put a lot of myself into my work and invested many hours drafting, re-drafting, proofing, editing and finally producing each book.

It was there, at the age of 21, that she came to know the Savior through the ministry of a local church.  Within a year of her conversion she became involved in a women’s prison ministry and discovered her passion for sharing the gospel publicly.Marci has been married to Arnie Preheim since August of 1993.  Shortly after their marriage, the Preheim’s moved to Nashville, Tennessee.  They have 2 children, Brock (born in 1995) and Paige (born in 1998).  Marci regularly teaches the women’s Bible study at Community Bible Church. For ten years, she led a monthly chapel service for women at the Nashville Rescue Mission (Hope Center for female recovering addicts).God has gifted Marci with the ability to teach the Bible in a simple and understandable way. Many who have sat under her teaching will say that her passion for the Lord and His word is contagious.  She is currently working on a series of Bible study guides for women. Marci has been a guest speaker for local women’s events and retreats. Most recently she led a Bible conference for women on the Caribbean island of Bonaire.Marci’s passion is for women to rediscover the power of the gospel as it applies to our everyday lives—to be freed from lies that we so easily believe and the fear of man that blinds us to what true righteousness is. “The righteous will live by faith” (Romans 1:17).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though you never know his name, he definitely\ncomes alive for you as his thoughts are clearly spelled out every step of the\nway. The events of his \"afterlife\" are also quite vivid, and one can clearly\nimagine what a horrid place Hell really is. While this story is almost strictly\nnarrative through a good deal of the book, it is definitely gripping enough\nthat you won't even realize it.

Relying on court transcripts, crime-scene photos, and the reminiscences of his legal mentors--Mel Glass, John Keenan, and D.A. Frank Hogan, all of whom were involved in the case--Tanenbaum recreates the proceedings with a novelist's sense of plotting. The seasoned attorney and two-time mayor of Beverly Hills, Calif., details how a young black man, George Whitmore Jr. (who had an IQ of less than 70), was connected to the killings by a confession extracted under extreme duress. Luckily, Manhattan Assistant D.A. Glass took an interest in the case and began to question the police tactics used to accuse Whitmore. A clue worthy of crime fiction eventually leads to the capture of the real killer, and a trial cleverly conducted by Keenan reveals police incompetence (and possible malfeasance) and sets Whitmore free. Tanenbaum's take on the case, which was cited by the Supreme Court in its 1966 Miranda v. State of Arizona decision regarding self-incrimination, is a thrilling and insightful addition to the true crime genre. --Publishers Weekly", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Within genre fiction, it's hard to be truly unique while still delivering a satisfying story. Stone accomplished this.
