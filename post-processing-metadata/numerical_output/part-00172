They were, said then Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy, \"given the ideal preparation to serve at the very heart of the home.\" But the daughter of Czechoslovakian parents, whose diplomat father moved them to the U.S. when his country fell under Soviet control, was far too intellectually ambitious to be sent into domestic exile. SeasonedTimepolitical reporter Ann Blackman's biography describes how Albright moved past the expectations of her time--and the challenges of being an immigrant--to become the highest-ranking woman in the history of U.S. politics when Bill Clinton picked her to be his second secretary of state.Through a peripatetic childhood, marriage and divorce, and the increasing demands of her work as a Ph.D. candidate, professor, and United States ambassador to the United Nations, Albright is revealed to be driven and demanding, a savvy diplomat who has forged relationships with world leaders and with a small, sustaining group of powerful American women. Extensively researched and enlivened by anecdote,Seasons of Her Lifeis a fascinating study of a very unusual and dynamic woman's rise to power.--Maria Dolan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

IATEFL Issues'The series breaks new ground in two respects. The first is the light and informal style of writing. It is notoriously difficult to write fluent prose using restricted lexis and syntax. Part of the secret is to use word and grammar lists flexibly; but it requires flair and a good ear to produce prose and dialogue that read so well and give such a genuine flavour of modern idiom.'

Hyperactive and curious, the lonely little boy was forbidden to go outdoors, and his only companion was his kindly nurse. When the political power shifted, Li's father was imprisoned and the family sent to live in a disease-infested slum. Yet Li was happy there, running wild with a gang of boys. His newfound freedom was short-lived, and he was sent to an eccentric but caring aunt in Shanghai, where he had to learn a new dialect, was taunted by classmates, and found himself at odds with the academic expectations. With the fall of Shanghai to the Communists, Li went to his parents in Hong Kong, where his father had sought refuge after prison. Li's education included expulsion, abusive homeschooling, and a middle school where he excelled. Finally, Li's father, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the Communist party, sent his son to a brutal reform school. The fiercely independent Li failed the final exam and realized that he had been manipulated by his father and the school. Returning home, he succumbed to depression and \"vulgar materialism\" before coming to accept his heritage and his father.

In 1947, the British, Americans and Russians are all looking for the legendary shield of Achilles because it may contain Element 61, a chemical element then missing from the periodic table that could be used in weapons. C.S. Grant, a British adventurer in need of a government pardon, agrees to help recover a murdered archeologist's notebook that may hold clues to the shield's whereabouts. A number of stock supporting characters, including an attractive female archeologist and an elderly scholar, accompany Grant to Crete in search of answers. While Harper offers some interesting discussions about the origins of Homer's poems, some readers may weary of such formulaic plot elements as a slow-motion romance, gunfights, hairbreadth escapes and the loss of a key clue.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eh. But then came issue #2; and instantly I was sold.The backstory for the Clown Jexter is told, and it is a marvelously inventive, original, and cohesive origin - three descriptive adjectives I'd feared I wouldn't be able to use for the series. With this sequence the entire epic premise comes into view like the bottom of a stilled-water lake on a cloudless day, and the excitement it garnered, for me, was second to none. A host of new characters within the Carnival are introduced and the series at last revealed its true purpose:one character's story will be told each issue, with a greater, epic arc building within and around each one, until the entire series comes together to form one massive, intricately laced tapestry.\" David Baxter - Broken Frontier", "related": ["B00HGITH6W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does. She makes no excuses for the darkness surrounding them, especially the paranormal creatures, and says that this is their world. She's just honoured to write down their adventures.", "related": ["B00G61DDDI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It proposes activities that faculty can use across their careers to awaken their intellectual curiosity, develop instructional prowess, and keep alive the motivation to teach with passion.Filled with wisdom and a healthy dose of wit, Inspired College Teaching puts the spotlight on how faculty can best use Weimer's tested improvement process. Step by step, she shows how to select changes, how to adapt them, how to implement them, how to assess their effects, how to revise them, and when to infuse these changes elsewhere in the classroom. This method rests on Weimer's premise that faculty can and should play the central role in their own improvement process.Only by being truly involved can faculty undertake the transformative activities that result in vibrant, invigorated teaching.Inspired College Teaching is the hands-on resource that can help faculty understand and plan for all that it takes to sustain teaching excellence across a career.", "related": [], "rank": 2411458, "title": "Inspired College Teaching", "author": "Maryellen Weimer", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At one end of the spectrum: Jane Fonda, Amnesty International, and a reporter named Washington Valdez, who all but created, in Powell's words, \"the femicide business.\" At the other, the truth: the murder rate of women is lower in Juárez than in other parts of Mexico or, for that matter, Philadelphia.

Sinclair, who has authored numerous California guidebooks, presents an amalgam of history and up-to-the-minute reporting, all concerning San Francisco's literary, popular, social and cultural evolution. The first chapter, on navigating the city, is the most practical, explaining the metropolis's geographical layout. From there, Sinclair goes on to recount the discovery of gold in the state in 1848, which \"triggered the biggest population movement the world had ever seen to a place... very few had previously heard of.\" The book covers much of the city's historical record, as it documents the rise and fall of various San Francisco leaders, architecture styles, political movements and more. Sinclair's volume creates an alluring portrait of a vibrant city, one that is certain to spur curious readers to seek out little-known attractions (such as Japantown) and view well-known ones (such as the Golden Gate Bridge) with a fresh eye.

We're married for four years now and we still need an inspiration to create something unique and genuine. Thank God for this book and our lives will change for the better. We are not aware we can use our baby's cord blood either to save a life of a sick child or to preserve it for our future use. My wife finished reading The Miracle Cure after three hours and she was impressed with the style of writing the author has used. The style of writing is friendly, easy-to-read and entertaining. My wife got also inspired with the transplant successful stories on Chapter four and she also enjoyed exploring the various cord blood websites in Chapter six. I don't read that much but I still decided to read the book and wow, I got the drive to read two more chapters after reading Chapter one. I seem to realize The Miracle Cure is an important book and it is a must-read for everyone, newlywed or not. - Eric Harrington, Amarillo, Texas.

I am a lot of things, but who I really am is a person who Dreams In Color.  Come dream with me! About me---I am not my hair, my eyes, my nose or my mouth. I am not my skin or the shape of any of my body parts. I am not the IQ of my brain. I am not the sound of my voice or the volume of my laughter. I am not my strengths or any of my weaknesses. I am not the level of my skills. The temple of my physical makeup is just a combination of genetics. It reveals nothing about the person who resides within. I take no credit or point no blame for the way I look. My \"Temple\" is perfect, as is. This body is not who I am. It is an exquisitely perfect dwelling for MY SOUL.. Everything about it is exactly as it should be. No other body, anywhere, ever, could serve my soul as well.  I am not anything you can see with your eyes, or touch with your hands. Should you judge me by that criteria you will \"never\" know me. I am not a dumping ground for bias that's based on a man-made standard. and I do not accept the prejudice it creates.  I am a union of body, To know me is to know yourself. Those who hear the voice of their soul, recognize the \"song in mine\". They do not stop at the front door and judge me by the dwelling in which I reside.  . The judgment of others does not change who I am. Quite the opposite is true. It reveals who they are. Those who deem me unworthy at a glance and pass me on by--Have my blessing to keep on walking--For they have a long way to go! They have not reached the point in their journey where they are able to see and appreciate me for who I am! Under those circumstances, you have the choice of accepting me, as is. I do not warrant that I will never change for the best. Nevertheless, my flaws to you also attribute to the greatness in me. In which I will not deny.

She now feels whole, like she finally belongs. She is welcomed into her new family with open arms, something she never experienced with her birth family. She has a new life and love, and she will protect what is hers to her dying breath.Destiny's Pathis a good story with moments of heart pounding suspense. The plot was nicely built up to allow for the appreciation of Sasha's development. I did enjoy the new take on the prophecy. It was a surprising little twist that seemed perfect. I was able to follow the story quite easily and found it very satisfying. I did have a sense that there are more stories to come. At least I hope so.As Ms. Hunter built her world, I was drawn in. I felt like I was home; all comfy and warm. Her writing was soothing and not rushed. The story was well paced and an easy read. This is not a shockingly pulsating story. Though there is action, I was more drawn to the characters and the welcoming arms of the pack. This is a nice change of pace for cold winter months.

As for Diana, inventor of an artificial heart p. 31 , she is facing divorce because she won't tell her husband Chase that her refusal to have children stems from the fact that she once lost a daughter. And if only the rising young attorney Casey had listened more closely to her lover Patrick's clues about his secret life, she could have saved herself some time investigating his past. Stone packs her story with beautiful women, mistaken situations and bitter rivalries, but realism is not a prime factor, as indicated by Casey's decision to wear her hair loose when trying a rape case, because, she thinks, \"the case was really about freedom, wasn't it?\" 800,000WHAT?/yes sirree/pk first printing.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From the outset, they are an endearing trio, but it is Cassie Jordan's story that drives the plot. The eldest of five children, Cassie is forced to make sacrifices-taking a job that offers security but not much excitement, caring for her aged mother-while Aileen, Laura and others move in and out of Cassie's life, offering glimpses into other worlds. The story moves to Dublin and London, from the world of banking to the backbiting arena of gossip columnists, making for a tale that never falters as Cassie finally is freed to pursue her own life. Scanlan (City Girl) keeps her readers involved through a supporting cast that adds humor, glitz, romance and plenty of spice. Part of the novel's charm is its study of the contrasts between a quiet village existence and the demands of modern life. This tale of one woman's determined efforts to find herself will have readers cheering both for the heroine and the author.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006Y0QZFO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The language was beautiful, but I admit that I had to look up the meaning of some words that aren't commonly used today. However, I quickly realized that this book contained much advice that I could apply to my own life today. Indeed, our generation can benefit from the \"gems\" of wisdom in this book just as much as the generation of the late 19th century.At the time that I decided to republish this book in an abridged and updated edition, it was out of print. Since then, several publishing companies have republished a scanned version of the original book. The original book contains over 600 pages. In this updated version, my role is that of an editor of the original text. I tried to maintain the original beautiful language except when needed to make a sentence or phrase more up to date and understandable. I combined and renamed related topics, thereby eliminating repetition and effectively shortening the book. I arranged the topics into applicable sections vs. being arranged randomly in the original book. It took several years (in my spare time) and numerous rewrites to come up with the finished version.  My favorite section is Family Life. The topics Courtship, Married Life, Advice to Husbands and Advice to Wives will go a long way toward helping couples marry wisely and have a marriage that will last. This alone makes the book worth reading. It also gives great parenting advice. Another favorite topic is The Trained Mind.Even though this is an updated version of the original book, I wanted the cover to look like an old book - one that hasn't sat on the shelf over the years, but is worn and used - one that has been read and referred to often. This the cover of this edition is absolutely beautiful! The book has wide margins so that the reader can jot down thoughts as they read and meditate on these \"gems\" of wisdom. I call these \"personal application\" thoughts. Those who browse through or read the book after you - perhaps your children or grandchildren - will benefit not only from the words of the authors but your words (gems) also.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He later transferred to Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism and subsequently spent many years with Newsweek and Forbes magazines in New York and Atlanta before relocating to the Lowcountry of South Carolina.  Semi-retired, he now divides his time between writing and tourism. As a U.S. Coast Guard- licensed captain, he ferries visitors across Calibogue Sound to conduct historical tours of remote Daufuskie Island, a Loyalist haven prior to the American Revolution. The island is rich in history and inspired the setting for much of his novel. It was there that he stumbled upon the complex issue of “heirs’ property”. Abuses are rampant, and unscrupulous lawyers and realtors make the situation worse. Because the predicament persists to this day, Thorn decided to bring it to light as the plot of his novel.   His second novel is in the works, and because of many readers’ enthusiastic response to the main characters it will be a sequel.   He and his wife live on Hilton Head Island, S.C.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The purpose was to give the reader a feel for life in the English slums and the struggles people faced in the Caribbean, as many traveled to the various Caribbean Islands in hopes of escaping the oppressive life they lived in London. Many times they found life in the Caribbean as harsh as back home in England, the result of the ever present threat of violence. The book is at times whimsical, yet deadly violent, then deeply sensual. A love story set to the backdrop of the violence and struggles of the early Caribbean colonies. This is a story of tall sailing ships, hard partying, hard fighting, and the ever present rum, a book not written for the timid.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

GUARDIAN: 'Thomson skilfully evokes the era and the slow-moving quality of childhood summers, suggesting the menace lurking just beyond the vision of her young protagonists. A study of memory and guilt with several twists.'  SCOTT PACK: 'A thoughtful, well-observed story about families and relationships and what happens to both when a tragedy occurs. It reminded me of Kate Atkinson. Thomson is particularly good at capturing the minutiae of childhood as well as the secrets, the lies, the make believe, the jealousies and spitefulness, the confusion and wonder of being nine years old.'  BOOK AFTER BOOK: 'Lesley Thomson's engaging writing style skilfully explores the obsession and the sense of guilt, hope and despair, trust and mistrust that will fill the lives of all the people who once knew the girl who disappeared. A masterful exploration of human feelings that is paired with an equally masterful description of the settings that form the background to this gripping story. Full of unexpected twists, this is a crime story that will leave you wondering until the end whether a crime has, in fact, been committed at all.'  SHOTSMAG: 'Such is the vividness of the descriptions of the location in this well structured and well written novel that I want to get the next train down...just when one thinks one can guess where it is leading, it switches, and the conclusion is a tense and gripping one. On the edge of my seat? No way - I was cowering under it.'  THE PARKINSON: 'Skilfully lays the foundations in the earlier chapters for what is to come. Each layer of the plot is carefully interwoven with the thoughts, wishes and desires of the main characters. Years pass culminating in the explosion of a shocking truth. If you enjoy a good thriller with more twists and turns than a cork screw, I recommend it.'  CANDIS MAGAZINE: 'Complex, disturbing and surprising...the sort of book where you simply have to completely rethink what you thought was going to happen - before sleeping with the lights on.'  THE ARGUS: 'The characterisation is particularly excellent...A sensitively written story, evocatively described, this is also an unusual thriller in that it easily bears a second reading.'  ABBEY'S BOOKSHOP: 'There is a touch of Susan Hill or Ruth Rendell in her (Barbara Vine) gothic mode here.

He felt lucky to have worked for a caterer who catered to the biggest names in show business. He received an offer to manage the Food and Beverage Department for a casino in a small gaming town in Nevada. He figured he had seen all there was to see and experience in the food business, especially after having his own restaurant for many years. So, he decided to accept the offer. Plus, Frank had been in a casino once before when he won a weekend trip to Las Vegas. He figured a customer is a customer is a customer. Frank packed up his tilted sense of humor (for lack of a printable word) and his love of laughter and making people laugh. He loaded up his lifelong fascination of people and their behaviors and moved to this small gaming town in Nevada. His first day on the job was like jumping into Lake Michigan from Navy Pier in Chicago any time in January. He was immediately cold-cocked by brand new behaviors from casino customers (the ones who could leave a trail of rude and obnoxious) and a whole new set of rules from his soon to be eaten words, a customer is a customer is a customer. After his second day on the job, he could have gone running out of the front doors with his arms flying in the air while yelling, \"Are you freeking kidding me\" He could have done that if he didn't find a sick attraction to what would be the most outrageous, unbelievable, and unimaginable customer behavior to come. Frank would say, \"I'm not here to work. I'm here for material for my book\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her experience in the publishing, advertising, and entertainment industries combined with her consulting and coaching work with small and large corporations worldwide have helped her develop fifty leadership “keys” needed by today’s executives. Compiled into this small, simply designed book, You’re an Executive, But Are You a Leader?, each key is presented on three pages: one holds an explanation of the key, the next presents a case study based on her consulting work, and the last offers questions and writing space for the reader to develop a personal action plan. Also included for each key is a relevant quotation from a world or business leader.The book is logically organized, starting with keys for personal leadership and moving onto team leadership keys and organizational leadership keys. In clearly and succinctly written text, Shelton addresses the development of value statements, setting objectives, problem solving, accountability, communication skills, evaluation, feedback, integrity, risk-taking, and celebrating and rewarding performance, among other topics. She recommends using this book “as a reference to spark ideas” throughout one’s career,” a process, she notes, that’s “as easy as finding the key that fits in the present moment.”The one-page synopsis and the accompanying case study address the basic aspects of each key, but Shelton’s format offers a superficial approach to very complex issues, many of which are the subject of entire books and multiday seminars. The two or three questions posed on the action plan page are a starting point, but won’t provide real help in creating an effective strategy. There are no suggestions of recommended readings or Web sites to search for additional guidance.The author works with individuals and organizations on the very issues that can’t be solved with a few key statements and a short action plan. The opening pages of her book provide information about hiring her as a motivational speaker or consultant; here, the reader will also find a suggestion to purchase the book for others in quantity discounts. As a reminder of key leadership issues, You’re an Executive, But Are You a Leader? might be useful after working with a consultant or coach like Shelton, but alone it cannot effectively help the reader develop meaningful leadership skills. More in-depth examination and explanation of nearly every key is needed.--Mary Crawford, Clarion ForeWord Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 2881707, "title": "You're an Executive But Are You a Leader?", "author": "Sonya Shelton", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I didn't feel as though it was rushed because of\nits length. These characters are smoking hot!! I want my own Jonas!!! I\nrecommend the heck out of this one!! It is panty melting good!! --KC Lu~Guilty Pleasures Book ReviewsThis was a very short but sweet tale of a Beauty (Erica) and a Beast (Jonas) in a contemporary setting.Despite the theme\n of potential non-consensual sex, don't be put off. This turns out to be\n a fun and sexy romp with fun to be had for both parties. Although Jonas\n is alluded to as a Dom, this is definitely BDSM light with little to no\n pain and/or bondage involved. Jonas makes sure Erica is well pleased\nand has a blast in the bedroom!--Shelley~The Forbidden BookshelfThe story was very erotic and sexy however I still found Jonas to be amazingly sweet. Normally a scarred, bald man covered in tribal tattoos should be very intimidating but I could tell deep down he had the capacity to be very romantic. In fact, while he played the role of the\nDom, he wasn't hardcore. He took his role seriously to see completely to\n her pleasure. It was very tender and sweet.--Lady McNiell~Mrs. Condit and Friends Read BooksErica and Jonas were great. There was lots of chemistry, and I have to\nsay that the sex scenes were sizzling hot. I've read a few BDSM erotica\nbooks, and some of them are hard for me because I'm not really familiar\nwith that lifestyle other then what I've read.

She has made the book come alive with true historical events as well as giving an account of one of the women whose kindness and love of service made this 2,000 mile march more enjoyable for all who traveled with her.  --Shirley N. Maynes, National President, U.S. Mormon Battalion AuxiliaryThe Faith of Phebe captured our thoughts as it led us through the hardships and joyful moments of a Pioneer Family. Every emotion of our souls was touched. The intrigue woven into the story makes it impossible to lay this book down. It increased our awareness of the great sacrifices made by our pioneer ancestors in their quest to settle the West and find religious freedom. Beverly has done a masterful job of compiling a most important part of history. We owe her a debt of gratitude.  --Howard & Doris Y.

I returned to my first love in the fall of 2004 when I landed a regular column in a regional paper. Each year has provided a new step in the path to my passion.

This gave an increased feeling out of place, not fitting in, being defective, and resulted in low self-esteem, getting teased, bullied, and having problems in school until being labeled as Emotionally Disturbed and being placed into 'Special Ed'. This escalated into trouble with the law, neighbors, friends, family, and himself.  Years of alcoholism, marijuana addiction, and other drug abuse eventually lead to isolation, depression, and despair. There seemed to be nothing left before reaching near suicide around January 31, 2008. This was soon before entering an outpatient rehab to first become (and remain) sober, clean, and working the 12 steps to recovery.  His first book, \"Honest Open Willing...My Journey From Despair To Hope\" was published in an attempt to show the public that people with addictions, mental illnesses, and different problems need understanding and support. Steven Adelman continues trying to carry the message as a way of expressing gratitude. If others can identify with him then maybe they will know they are not alone and that there is hope for them too!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was born in Detroit on May 7, 1948, and dreamed of becoming a writer from an early age, but poor grades in English throughout school suggested a far different future. After three unsuccessful years at an engineering school, and several dead end jobs in various technology fields, he enrolled in the adult education program at the local high school for mainly social purposes. Beginning Astrology looked like the most promising class offered. There were sure to be interesting single females in a class like that, and even if he shared the usual scientific doubts about the validity of the 'superstition,' he wouldn't let it get in the way of what might turn out to be a social life. But reality rarely follows the path our fantasies plan. The more he looked at his chart, the more he realized it described him perfectly. It said he'd change his name, live far from where he was born, and most importantly, his dream of becoming a writer was within grasp after all, if he put enough work into learning how. The next class his chart suggested he enroll in was Creative Writing, and was actually fun, nothing like the English classes he'd always struggled through in school. Nine years in a Writers Workshop followed, producing a dozen short stories and one long 'test' novel, which technology rendered obsolete before a publisher could be found. With literary success limited to a massive stack of rejection slips, he entered the newly emerging home computer field. After moving to Oregon, his artistic efforts merged away from writing and programming toward computer art, which occupied him for the next 20 years.

It is not a potpury of known topics but a new composition covering all areas of nanosciences. The book is very useful to graduate students and also to professors to design lectures. Also established researchers can still learn from this book. This comprehensive overview of various fields is highly desirable for further stimulation of successful research and advanced teaching and studying. This book is of high value for scientists, teachers, and graduate students involved in this field. Although there are many publications in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, I am not aware of another book which treats this field as comprehensively, farsightedly, and competently as this book. This is due to the composition of this book which makes all disciplines of nanoscience appear in a new light and which offers new insight and rich stimulation for concepts of teaching and planning of research projects. In conclusion, I would like to recommend this book to all graduate students and scientists active in the various field of nanoscience in teaching, academia and industry. It can be anticipated that this text can yield for years most stimulating inspiration for teachers and researchers since it presents and elucidates in a an excellent, attractive and comprehensive manner the fundamentals and intercorrelations of nanoscience.\"Reviews on individual chapters by specialists:Brent Fultz, Professor of Materials Science and Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA: \"I read with interest the text of Chapter 1 and the Table of Contents and enjoyed reading it. It is quite clean and the English is excellent. Chapter 1 provides a fine coverage of the underlying issues in the physics and chemistry of nanoscience. I liked the presentation of those topics for which I was already familiar, and I found the explanations useful for learning about topics that were new to me. The style is well suited for an advanced textbook for graduate students and researchers. Researchers will also benefit from the extensive citations to the literature. The Table of Contents shows an ambitious coverage of a broad range of topics. I expect these other chapters will match the quality of Chapter 1, so I expect this book to be an impressive achievement.\"Chapter 2 by Prof. Dr. Horst P. Strunk, Institut für Materialwissenschaft, Universität Stuttgart, Germany: \"Microscopy - nanoscopy. This topic is very timely. The manuscript is written in a very concise and comprehensive manner, it describes the state of the art of microscopy in nanoscience rather clearly by including prominent examples from solid state physics, molecular chemistry, and biology. The well organized description of scanning probe microscopy, far-field optical microscopy beyond the diffraction limit, progress in electron microscopy, x-ray microscopy, and the development of atom probes makes this text an important source for students and scientists. I will always advise my students and colleagues to consult this very didactic text as a prerequisite for structural studies in nanotechnology down to the atomic scale.\"Prof. Dr. R. Ghosh, Dept. of Bioenergetics, Institute of Biology, University of Stuttgart, Germany: \"I very much enjoyed reading the manuscript of chapter 11. This is an excellent and concise tutorial-like overview of the most important nanosize aspects in modern biology, on recent research, measuring aspects and application issues. The chapter shows an impressive coverage of very topical subjects such as the nanostructure of the cell, nanomechanics of DNA and proteins, the structure and function of molecular motors, membrane channels, nanostructures of bone and teeth, photonic nanostructures of butterflies and beetles, the lotus leaf effect, food nanostructures and finally cosmetics. This well organized text with the many beautiful figures that can be directly used for my teaching and by graduate students for their advanced studies. Finally I very much appreciated the style and the selection of the topics of this chapter.\"Prof. Dr. Lothar Ley, Institute of Condensed Matter Physics, University of Erlangen, Germany: \"After reading chapter 5., I feel that this survey is very comprehensive. In this concise text a number of aspects can be discussed only briefly but since every aspect is backed by the relevant references, the reader can easily study the more extended literature. The wealth of the figures opens an additional rich source of information and will contribute to make the chapter a frequently quoted review. My congratulations to this manuscript. I will use this book in my lectures.\"Univ. Prof. Dr. Heinz Krenn, Institute of Physics, Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz, Austria: \"I enjoyed reading chapter 8. It is an experimentally sound survey of nanomagnetism which so positively contrasts other textbooks such as the book 'Nanomagnetism - Ultrathin Films, Multilayers, and Nanostructures' by D. L. Mills and J. A. C. Blend (2007). My congratulations for this comprehensive text. I will use it for my lectures and highly recommend it to students.\"Dr. Hartmann Schaefer, former manager Medicinal Chemistry/Regulatory Affairs (Retired from Byk Gulden GmbH, now Nycomed GmbH): \"I read with grerat pleasure the two chapters 10. and 12. The author succeeded in convincingly documenting the two fields in a good teaching style and a most transparent and compact presentation, amply illustrated by informative and elucidating figures. The chapter on nanochemistry yields an excellent survey of the recent developments of nanoaspects in basic and applied chemistry. The chapter on nanomedicine is a comprehensive text on this rapidly growing field. Finally, a competent discussion of risk assessment strategies and toxicity considerations is given which are prerequisites for the transfer of novel nano-methodologies into clinical assays. These chapters can be fully recommended to students and colleagues in academia and industries.\"From the reviews:“The twelve chapters are organized together well to create a logical natural structure. Each chapter contains an extensive list of references and is profusely illustrated with figures. … of interest to researchers and graduate students in the broad field of nanoscience and nanotechnologies. It can be also useful for engineers who are involved in production and processing of nanomaterials for structural, functional and biomedical applications. I expect this book to have a significant impact on research in both fundamental nanoscience and practice concerning nanotechnologies.” (I. A.

Written when she was ten years old, the book had lurid scenes of little girls doing the can-can and flashing their white cotton underpants at little boys who yelled, “Whoo! Whoo!” She was rewarded for her unsettling exposé of the fourth grade with (what would soon become) a permanent chair in the principal’s office.  Her next honorarium came in high school when she rewrote the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. In her version, Goldie’s food theft was rationalized by her fondness for marijuana. She was rewarded for this insight into Goldie’s baffling character trait with a three-day suspension so she could, “Think about what she did.”  As an adult she was a freelance writer for national magazines that included Cosmopolitan, GQ, Essence and The New Yorker. She didn’t actually sell any articles to those magazines, but she certainly did write for them. In some magazines circles she’s still known as Slush Pile Sally. Her feature length movie, My Fair Lidy, was produced by Sand Woman Productions.  She notes that if you didn’t like the movie, don’t blame her because they didn’t film the movie she wrote. She also wrote the plays, Christmas Matzo at the Doublewide Diner, Friday Night Vows, It’s all in your mind and Shameless Women. All were produced and received rave reviews from the dozen or so people who actually came to the theatre. Her optioned work includes Randolf the Marionette, a children’s television show optioned by Worldgate Studios, and The Locket, a short optioned by CS Productions. Neither of which has ever seen the light of day—but at least the checks didn’t bounce. As the author of the Truly Julie novels Rootie has a lot in common with her main character. She was a tour guide for ten years in Florida where she taught British tourists to beware of Florida’s two biggest predators—alligators and Mickey Mouse. One devours flesh, the other wallets. Like Truly Julie, Rootie lived in the Everglades and developed a deep appreciation for wildlife, swamps, and reckless men.

Surely among the greatest riches in this homiletical storehouse were the sermons of German Protestant Orthodoxy. The story I had gotten in seminary was that Protestant Orthodoxy was dead and dry - not worth looking at. The sermons of Valerius Herberger proved that judgment more than faulty. Herberger's sermons are full of life and vitality. They show us protestant spirituality at its most profound.In our day so starved for a religion of the heart, Herberger opens up the contemplative study of the Word of God so that it becomes for us a word of life. He preached in an age full of change and trouble, an age that yearned for something more than the power of positive thinking.... The Christian Church has had a lot of great preaching - the sort of preaching that is indeed a means of grace.---Prof. H. O. Old, PhD, John H. Leith Professor of Reformed Theology and Worship, Dean of the Institute for Reformed Worship, Erskine Theological Seminary, South CarolinaThe Lutheran pastor and hymn-writer Valerius Herberger was known as the Jesus Preacher in his day, and this focus is quite evident in his very readable commentary on Genesis. Divided into 178 Meditations, each headed Jesus . . . , it combines thorough familiarity with the Hebrew language and Bible history with practical applications filled with a warm awareness of the Savior's presence in the Christian's life. Along with abundant connections between Genesis and other passages, there is a ceaseless flow of reflections on Biblical references and Old Testament Messianic hope.Herberger was also called the Little Luther and one is indeed reminded of the Reformer's lively style in the warnings, comforts, anecdotes, humor, and Old Testament Christocentricity, while the interspersed petitions bring to mind Bengel's Gnomen. The translator has shed much light on Herberger's thinking and allusions in his renditions and annotations. It will be found a rich and delightful resource for sermons and Bible classes as well as private devotions.---Prof. Thomas Manteufel, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Systematic Theology, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, MO, Chairman of the C.F.W. Walther Round TableIn this clearly translated and helpfully annotated edition, Matthew Carver provides the contemporary reader with a central work by the sadly long-neglected Lutheran pastor and scholar, Valerius Herberger. . . . Herberger s Great Works of God remains a remarkably inspiring work for Christians of all communions, offering the general reader and scholar alike striking insights into the dynamic religious thought of the Lutheran world just prior to the devastation of the Thirty Years War, and reflecting the finest linkage of firm piety and close scholarly attention, a heritage ever serviceable in Herberger's age and our own. - --Peter C.

Lucia launches offenses such as a Tilling tapestry project and spends considerable time countering moves by Elizabeth, such as driving a motor car, introducing the game of Monopoly, and presenting fake aristocratic ancestors. Norma West reads this story of foolish pursuits rather too well. She makes the characters all too believable, a strategy that unfortunately means all too irritating. She produces just the right note for Lucia, with her cloying appeals and affected use of Italian. Listeners will find this story either charming and funny or trivial and inane.

Skull Eye Island has won the 2012 Adventure Writers  Competition's Grand Master Award sponsored by the Clive Cussler Collector's Society. Kirkus Reviews says Skull Eye Island (book 1) is: \"A heartwarming tale of a boy essentially orphaned in search of his father, the novel never ceases to entertain.  Greene’s swashbuckling tale of high-seas adventure is pure, uncomplicated fun\". The books are based in the early 1800's on the main character Jonathan Moore and his adventures on the sailing ship HMS Poseidon, a forty-four gun fighting frigate of the Bristish Royal Navy. The volumes are age approriate, no magic or vampires, and historically accurate.  “I wanted to create a story that would be exciting for children and young adults, and one that was easy to read aloud. I also wanted to keep the adults interested so that children could see their parents enjoying the story and see that reading is fun,” said Greene. “That’s how we create future readers, by setting an example.” Jonathan Moore, the hero of Skull Eye Island and Castle of Fire succeeds using courage, intelligence and determination. “I believe that is a wonderful lesson for everyone: that they have it within themselves to do something great,” says Greene. “No need to wait for a magical event or some strange relative to grant you a bizarre power – we can succeed and excel with what we have inside ourselves.” Peter lives in Arizona, with his wife and two children.", "related": ["B00H2BGCWK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, her mother always actively discouraged her from joining a church and leading a religious life. When her mother finally took her to a church, Larkin found herself dissatisfied: “The people were nice to me, but they didn’t talk much about the Lord. They seemed more interested in talking about what was right and wrong—not a whole lot different than my mother.” Lost and despondent, the 13-year-old Larkin happened upon a poster in the nearby college town of Knoxville, Tenn., that read, “Free Food, Free Music, Free Love.” Larkin took the ad as a sign from God and went to the listed address, where she was greeted by the seemingly warm and generous members of the Children of God, also known as the Family. Larkin joined them and eagerly relinquished all her possessions to the group. The Family’s regular proselytizing, or “witnessing,” consisted at first of distributing leaflets and singing on street corners, but then began incorporating “Flirty Fishing,” in which female members persuaded outsiders to join the Family by flirting and eventually sleeping, with them. Larkin’s spiritual journey takes another unexpected turn when she gives birth to a daughter, Berta, with cerebral palsy. Her challenges as she tried to raise Berta in the Family—where no one member is allowed to receive special treatment—led Larkin to see her life in the Children of God as unsustainable and detrimental to her and her daughter’s well-being. In this fine memoir, the author’s voice is emotional and fervent, but her prose style is relatively unadorned. She conveys her story in simple but powerful language which consistently makes her account an absorbing read.A captivating story of one woman’s journey to spiritual freedom.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Celeste is justifiable in her doubt about Ray's sincerity- he never gave her a chance to decide what she wanted for her future. He made his own decision based on his own feelings and left her without a word. She has been a single mother for the past eight years and it helped her grow from a girl to a woman. Ray notices the difference and has taken the time away to mature himself, although he still holds on to some insecurity, making him more human to me. Their connection is palpable and the story unfolds effortlessly. I look forward to reading more from Ms. Renfro. - Elissa Kyle --Romance Readers Connection, June 15, 2007TORTILLAS AND SECOND CHANCES is a sweet and tender story of a second chance at first love. Ray and Celeste's lingering feelings are clear right from the start and rekindle steadily through the story, even with the tension of their big secrets. Their emotional growth and maturity over the past decade is deftly written, and makes their understanding and forgiveness of past hurts believable. This is a classic romance in a modern setting. Heartfelt, touching and romantic, it's the kind of story that will make readers laugh and cry and then read the book all over again. - Leigh Orlowski --Romance Junkies, July 2007", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An entertaining and fascinating (sometimes jaw-dropping) insight into Victorian homosexual practices.' Observer 'A superb new portrait of the secret life of one of the 19th century's most tragic and beguiling figures.' Washington Post 'Intriguing and entertaining ... McKenna makes an impassioned case for re-gaying Wilde.' The Times McKenna provides what is certainly the definitive account of the Boulton/Park story ... McKenna lays bare a fascinating tapestry of interrelated personal histories. History Today RIch and absorbing ... McKenna has done a tremendous job of recreating Victorian London's gay subculture, weaving newspaper reports, police documents and contemporary diaries into a jolly rollicking narrative. It would be an understaement to call it a colourful book ... Fanny and Srella is a cracking read. The Sunday Times You would need to be a very dull - or prim - dog indeed not to find this a terrifically entertaining story. Neil McKenna has thrown himself into it with unfettered glee. If the opportunity arises to describe an anal fistula - and it does, frequently - he does not shirk it. [McKenna is] a sufficiently crisp, colourful and funny writer. Evening Standard Neil McKenna uses the meticulous court records from the two trials, together with the associated evidence - letters, mainly, between the accused and their confederates - to reconstruct the story of how Boulton and Park got to be Stella and Fanny ... McKenna plunges us into a world of lush longing ... quite brilliantly ... McKenna does an excellent job of dusting [Fanny and Stella] down for the 21st century, testing the limits of his documentary source material and showing what happens when the biographer allows himself the licence to go inside his subject's head. His writing has much of the performative element that characterised Stella and Fanny's appearances on the streets of London and in provincial halls. Showy as a feather boa, McKenna's text takes pleasure in its own silly excess ... Purists and puritans may balk at the book, both its tone and its way of proceeding. But everyone else will have a ball. -- Kathryn Hughes Guardian [A] rollicking account of the trial of two middle-class Victorian cross-dressers. The Sunday Times ~ Must Reads [McKenna's] examination of the case is excellent ... It's a book that's worth reading. Mail on Sunday Neil McKenna's lively account of a mid-Victorian scandal. Literary Review Wonderful ... This is a great read. It will be made into a movie as sure as Neil McKenna is the greatest gay biographer of our era. QX Magazine Neil McKenna's often jaw-dropping tale... Faced with such terrific material, McKenna could easily have told the story straight (as it were). In the event, he puts in a performance easily as theatrical as his heroines in their pomp. While the basic research can't be faulted, he also gives us the inner thoughts of everybody concerned ... A largely irresistible story, complete with a big courtroom finish that I won't spoil. Daily Mail The extraordinary story of two cross-dressing young men. -- ~ Book of the Month Eastern Daily Press McKenna gives a vivid and well-researched account of the events which unfoldedand the Victorian drag underworld which the yong men inhabited. maturetimes.co.uk A Fascinating slice of social history ... McKenna conjures the grubby glamour and camp excesses of Fanny and Stella's lives. He has a lot of fun with his subject while remaining sypathetic to those involved. Metro A great read. We Love This Book McKenna does a masterful job of recreating the lives of Fanny and Stella ... McKenna once again shows himself adept at meticulous research. He delivers a brilliant dissection of the plotting by authorities that led to the trial of Fanny and Stella. With his polished sense of narrative, McKenna's new book is a page-turner, rendered in felicitous, witty prose that makes the tragicomic lives of the two cross-dressers an unforgettable tale. In telling it, he provides a panoramic picture of a stratum of underworld queer English life in pre-Wilde days that is an important contribution to gay historiography ... This fascinating account richly merits a place on your bookshelf. Gay City News Neil McKenna has immersed himself in their world of Slap-Bum Polka, frocks, cold cream, glycerine and tweezered eyebrows. Telegraph Gripping and novelistic history ... McKenna has unearthed plentiful evidence. Sunday Telegraph A most extraordinary tale through which author Neil McKenna paints a picture of a society that was a long, long way from the home life of our own dear Queen ... A fascinating reminder that Victorian society was nowhere near as respectable as it liked to believe. Sunday Express Uproarious ... McKenna relates their astonishing story with meticulously researched relish ... McKenna captures their arrest with the same joie de vivre as Stella and Fanny lived their tumultuous lives: a blur of petticoats, shrieks and confusion ... It's a wonderful, gripping and moving story, including a pithy epilogue revealing what happened next to the major players. Tim Burton or Baz Luhrmann must make this into a film. The Times The story is entertainingly told by Neil McKenna, the outstanding biographer of Oscar WIlde. Jewish Telegraph McKenna's book is massively entertaining with the necessary double entendres, lascivious and perhaps excessive narrative to keep us happy, as he brings back to life this extraordinary tragicomic expose of the back streets of 19th century London. Sunderland Echo Very seductive. McKenna is rightly confident of the appeal of his funny, dramatic and secretly quite significant story. Financial Times Both a fun and well-researched history. BBC History Magazine [McKenna] writes in technicolour ... McKenna has pulled it off again. Islington Tribune Full of dash and colour.

With a suit of adaptations to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, and a remarkable social system, the capybara is the South American ecological equivalent of the medium-sized ungulates of Africa. Their size, adaptations and habitat make them fascinating in their own right, and a revealing model for studies of the evolution of animal societies. Furthermore, from prehistory to the present day they have been hunted for their meat and skins, and nowadays they are both farmed and harvested, which makes them an illuminating case study for discussions of sustainable use. This blend of attributes makes the capybara a focus of specialist interest and a source of general principles, and these two ends of the readership spectrum are both encompassed by the extraordinary international team of 36 authors that have contributed the 24 inter-disciplinary chapters of this book. Written in an accessible style that will satisfy generalists, practitioners and specialists alike, this book represents the compendious ‘one-stop-shop’ that will be the benchmark publication on capybaras and on neotropical wildlife management for years to come.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I adored the fact that there were parts of this book that made me literally, laugh out loud. There were also parts that had me reaching for the Kleenex because I was in tears. To me, any book that makes you do both - is a winner in my eyes!I know that this is a short review but, I don't want to give away too much of it because I want you to read it. This book is totally worth the Six Bucks that it costs (or $4.61 on Amazon) - so go! Buy it! You will not be upset.

When you use your imagination for your job, you look for ideas everywhere - sometimes a little desperately. Once you’ve trained your brain to work in this way, it’s very hard to switch it off. So even when I’m not working, everything I read or see sparks an idea.  Because of my love of books, a lot of the time these ideas are related to plots or storylines. For my own amusement, on the long and often boring journeys to client presentations, I would pass the time by knitting these ideas together into stories. Over many journeys and years, the characters developed and the stories evolved.  At work, I often found myself in a position where I spent a lot of time in meetings and very little time doing what I loved. So I sought other ways of putting my imagination to good use. It was at this point that I decided to put some of my ideas down on paper.

She is leaving tomorrow on a cruise where she'll meet her grandmother and sister. They're expecting Nina to bring her new husband, but Nina isn't married. A free-spirited travel writer eager to please, she decided to cheer up her grandmother when she was ill by telling that she had a boyfriend, and, well, it just snowballed from there. When Nina meets the veterinarian who will be taking over for her current one, it seems as though fate has intervened. He is a \"doctor\" and his name is Steve, just like she told her grandmother. Nina asks him to go with her and pose as her husband. Steve is intrigued by Nina, but says no; that is, until his ex-wife informs him that she is following him to Denver. As Steve learns more about Nina, he becomes very interested, but Nina is so worried about keeping her stories straight, she doesn't realize that he is falling for her.

After passing the state examinations he became the first foreign veterinary practitioner in the state of Tennessee. He specialized in hematology, skin diseases and small-animal medicine. Some time after establishing his clinical practice Swamiji was initiated into Tantra by his guru, Acharya Sakitpada, the eminent Dakshinpanthi Tantra Yogi and Vedantist. Acharya Saktipada also imparted Swamiji with practical knowledge of Vedanta. Swamiji practiced Tantra under his Guru's guidance for many years. After heeding his spiritual call to abandon his practice and become a renunciate, Swamiji took sannyasa and devoted himself completely to spiritual sadhana. Swamiji has been a renunciate since his initiation into sannyasa in 2002. Swamiji derives great inspiration from Swami Jyotirmayanda’s teachings and writings and strives to present Vedanta in a simplified manner. The main goals of Swamiji's life are to make Vedanta accessible to all and help people transform their negativity into positive sentiments in order to attain self-realization. Swamiji gives lessons on the Bhagavata Gita, Upanishads and Vedanta and instructs his disciples in various aspects of yoga. His is a practical approach towards religion and spirituality. Acharya Abhayananda has been a disciple of Swami Adyananda Saraswati since 2006. He received disksha from Swamiji in 2007. He is a karma sannyasi and strives to integrate the teachings of Vedanta into his daily life as a householder and computer scientist.

I can well imagine it awakening a life-long passion for history ... I cannot imagine a better introduction to medieval life and the complicated history of those times.\"  Margaret Lane inThe Observer\"**A child bride, a child queen, seven year old Isabella of France, who was married to Richard the II of England in a marriage of convenience, lives again in Hilda Lewis' spirited, sparkling, poignant fictionalized biography. Here are portraits of \"Richard, tender and cruel, faithful and false, betraying and betrayed\", seen through the eyes of fifteen year old Isabella Clinton, raw from the country and Woman to the Queen. The author has selected with a sure instinct for the dramatic, incident and dialogue depicting the fate of the \"French King's daughter\" in her marriage to the British monarch who early in his reign was devoted to peace, to learning and to beauty and the arts. The pleasure and haven he found in his child Queen amidst the plotting of false friends and open enemies at court is perfectly credible in this portrait of a man who delighted in \"a flower, a little painting or a small song\". Her loyalty to her King and husband as he became more intent on power and finally blind to prudence and justice, the fortitude with which she bore for France characterize a stout-hearted heroine. Almost as fascinating as the Queen's story is that of the narrator, whose romance with Gilles Cobham is interwoven with Tyler's rebellion, the abduction of the Duke of Gloucester, the banishment of Henry Bolingbroke and Richard's defeat and death. The story of the small queen, the gentle falcon who loved her cage and her captor, is princely reading fare.\" Kirkus Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 1207423, "title": "The Gentle Falcon", "author": "Hilda Lewis", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was working as a substitute teacher in the school year of 2005-06. While filling in for teachers across a variety of different\nschools and grade levels, I came into contact with many of the children from\nthe areas that were affected by the storm whose families had relocated to\nrebuild their lives. One thing that has stayed with me ever since, has been the\nsense of emotional trauma that I observed among many of them. I remember wishing\nthat there was a way that I could have reached out to them somehow. I suppose I\nwanted to come up with a way to aid them in dealing with the sense of grief and\nloss that many struggled to come to grips with during that difficult time. While\nI know that this sort of thing is better left to mental health professionals\ntrained to offer that kind of support through therapy and other means this\ndesire never left me. It was only then\nthat I thought I might be able to do so in my own small way through YA Science\nFiction. I wanted to create a protagonist who, due to suffering through a\nsimilar experience, deals with the pain created by such loss through aiding\nothers who might suffer the same.Ashalonis the result. Many years have passed since then, and most of the children I was\nprivileged to meet that school year are of college age or better. Nonetheless, I\nstill hope that it can be of use in some way to aid others of all ages struggling\nto cope with this kind of pain due to similar events. Of course\nthis is not the only theme of the book. It is one among others, but remains the\noriginal motivation that stoked its creation. God willing, it will be the first\nof many in a continuing series. Last, though certainly not least, it is a book\nthat I hope those who read it will come to enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": 2670834, "title": "Ashalon (The Ashalon Chronicles Book 1) eBook", "author": "Rob Ussery", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her creative artistic side could never rest as she tried her hand at every form of artistry. Eventually her hobby became an expertise, and Sharon became a guest lecturer for the Utah Shakespeare Festival, taking her knowledge and love of history and Shakespeare on the road to high school advanced placement and honors English classes with presentations and lectures. Sharon’s passion for Shakespeare and her love of acting moved her from books to the actual stage. She has performed in numerous reader’s theatre productions and been a judge of high school drama competitions. At the age of 70, Sharon hit on the ultimate outlet for her skills, knowledge, and artistic talents and became the creator of her own magical world—the Kingdom of Hamelot. She loves and cares about the characters of the kingdom as if they were family. She takes the greatest pleasure in seeing the joy her stories bring to others. With more than 100 characters and 50 stories so far, Sharon plans to spend the rest of her life continuing to bring life, adventures and characters to her beloved Hamelot.", "related": ["B00B1X16LW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Once the technology can be stabilized and put into widespread use, I think it will sweep through society and alter every conceivable facet of our lives. And the thing that shocked me most in my research is how close we are getting to some of the things portrayed in this story. Some of the things I planned on including in the book are actually in experimentation.Q: What inspired you to writeCure?In writing this book, I wanted to portray the here and now--the corruption of our current system, the backroom dealings, the corporate espionage, and the corporate greed--in a way which would underline the larger issue of a broken health care system which seems to offer less [care] for more [cost].Cureis the story of nanotechnology, a breakthrough which could turn the whole system on its head: to offer, at the lowest cost possible, a cure for virtually every disease suffered by humanity.Q: What makesCuredifferent from all of the other books on this subject?Most of the books in this genre go the route of the technological thriller.Nanoby Robin Cook andPreyby Michael Crichton are two well-known examples. I'm not saying they're wrong or that they're bad books, but I wanted to move away from the spy thriller style to explore our possible future.I decided to go with a character to whom nanotechnology was as new as any reader who might pick up the book but who had enough access to know what was going on.

Hemda was the first baby born in a progressive kibbutz, raised with high expectations as her mother traveled the world raising money to support her. Now elderly, Hemda lies in a hospital in Jerusalem after a fall in her apartment; she revisits moments from her past, imagining that her parents are visiting her at her bedside. Instead, it&'s her children who wait nearby, bringing their own issues: having missed her opportunity to have a second child, Dina wants to adopt, but her husband and her daughter think she&'s deluded and refuse to participate; and Avner, after seeing a dying man at the same hospital where his mother is being treated, is obsessed with finding the man&'s grieving partner. Shalev captures both the stuffy claustrophobia of the hospital and the abyss of possibility outside as Hemda&'s health problems force her children to reckon with their legacies and change what they can. The author&'s long, internal-facing paragraphs amplify the drama and allow each of the Horovitzes to have a say as they face an uncertain future without Hemda&'s influence.

When they lose control of their emotions they feel stunted and fear that God has abandoned them. This is why Melvin Hanna's book,Mood Food, is a welcome resource in a time when there is much confusion about the role emotions play in the lives of Christian believers. The main themes of the book point us back to scripture and how we can use the spiritual discipline of learning to converse with Jesus about our emotional states and transform these emotions so that they help us to discover God's purpose for them.\"-Archibald D. Hart, Ph.D., FPPR. Senior Professor of Psychology and Dean Emeritus, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California.“In an age where a person's immature emotions are often sabotaging his success and relationships this is a very welcome and much needed work. Melvin Hanna writes out of a wealth of experience teaching students at the University of the Nations in many countries of the world.  He is greatly respected by students and his University colleagues.  This lucid, practical and helpful approach in developing emotional maturity is both refreshing and life changing.”– Dr. Bruce Thompson, International Dean Emeritus, College of Counseling and Health Care, University of the Nations\"How do we harness core emotions such as shame, fear, anger, and sadness to allow them to work for us rather than against us?  Dr. Hanna confronts this question with the rationality one would expect of a chemistry professor, but with the insight and compassion of a follower of Jesus Christ.  God created us with emotions for a purpose: to motivate us to glorify Him.  The new way of living that this book proposes is the life-long habit of conversing with Jesus about the emotions we feel in given situations and listening to His reply.As I read this book I stopped to ponder Hanna’s advice.  What would my life have been like had I paused to ask God how to deal with emotional situations?  The answer came to me before the question was formed.  I think it will to all of Dr. Hanna’s readers.I highly recommend this book as an outstanding guide to daily living.\" -Keith M.

He offers sketches of major figures, both military and civilian, worthy of a gifted novelist, as well as first-class battle narratives (although some may feel he scants the naval war, where the British holding the line was a necessary condition of victory). He also discusses the grand strategy, which shaped the campaign in the context of the divergent aims of the three major Allied powers—the British wanting to keep Imperial communications, the Americans wanting an invasion of Europe, and Stalin wanting a second front anywhere that would get the Germans off his neck.

The stories are brought to life through atmospheric prose, beautiful photography and artwork inspired by the golden era of ghosts, the Victorian age. \"My partner often asks me why I write ghost stories -- and why I don't write wholesome stories for children! My answer is simple: there is more horror in our local communities, on every street corner, than there is a single macabre tale. Tales of nefarious deeds and the supernatural are often vehicles for exploring human frailty; in telling them, we may help society to debate and unravel the age-old moralistic dilemmas we as humans are constantly trying to understand and define.\" P.

Know as an advocate for social and governmental change, he was an activist long before he joined the ranks of the hackers group Anonymous.

Even though he received a formal education, his real school of learning come from his difficult life out in the world. Having lefy home at a very young age because of differing views on religion than his parents, he found that he was fending for himself. It was because of this he was able to see the flaws in the current way that the majority of society lives their lives. Being a child of generation X, he gave up hope for any chance of change early in life, and waited for signs that the world is ready for change. The time finally came with the ever evolving internet, seeing how the internet would be the medium for social and governmental change; he dedicated a large amount of effort and self teaching himself everything related to computers and the internet. When the hackers group called Anonymous took the world stage, he was already set off on a hitchhiking journey through the Americas. His revolution finally started and he had a front row seat.  This man was influenced by three major authors: Jack Kerouac, Hermann Hesse and Hunter S. Thompson, not just in his writing but his life. He is joined in life with his best friend and wife Patricia; an amazing, beautiful and extremely intelligent woman from Northern Mexico. Who is also a world citizen and traveler, the two plans to spend their lives exploring the planet. “How to Grow a Mask” is the first book the planned series of three.

Snow adds an extra ingredient—a boyish enthusiasm for his subject . . . a meticulous and fascinating account.” —The Times(UK)“Snow builds his account on the voices of those who fought and witnessed the campaign, from nervous U.S. militiamen to Ross, Cockburn, and Dolley Madison, the president’s resourceful wife. Written with verve and insight, this is a fitting reminder of a remarkable interlude in a war that deserves to be better known.” —BBC History Magazine“The result is superb. When Britain Burned the White House is an exemplary work of history—lucid, witty, and humane, with terrific pace, and so evenhanded that it will surely be received as well in America as here.” —The Spectator(UK)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Deloy's inspiration:Mr Deloy wrote a mission statement, which we here reproduce as he wished:Throughout history society has tended to ignore, discard and reject the different, the extra-ordinary - the deviants. 'Sorcerers', 'possessed', they were once called. In some eras such accusations would lead to punishments such as ostracism, incarceration or even death, and in our day they are still usually pilloried to the margins of society, and labeled 'mentally ill' or 'unstable': falling into psychiatric definitions of various disorders. However, these 'marginalized figures' actually constitute three percent of society, and are often people who are extremely talented, but frequently naive in other aspects. These extra-ordinaries may be ordinary people, but also leaders, thinkers or artists - whom society considers 'normal'. They spiritually and artistically push society forwards, but are not rewarded for doing so, and rarely get acknowledgement for their unique contributions until years after their death. Due to society's inability to accept the different, its lack of motivation to contain, empower and direct those who often sow its future, humanity first 'reaps' these extra-ordinaries, and then harvests the fruits of their seeds.The credo of this book is that the human race is consciously ready for a change in its approach to the subject. These individuals should not be seen as deviants but rather as unique talents, who are separated from humanity because of their uncompromising beliefs, naivety and marked differences. I call them 'Parallels'. Behind the writing of this book lies a real cause - to shed positive light on people that society defines as mentally disturbed or ill, those who feel they have been pushed to the margins, or who just hold an 'unacceptable' point of view. The aim here is to contain, empower and endow society with the ability to accept the different.Through the example of a graphic designer in crisis - who could be you or me - re-discovering himself even while synchronizing his life with that of Jesus Christ - one of history's greatest Parallels - I hope to inspire people to find their unique path in life, being their own true selves, and thereby endowing other people's lives with deeper meaning.Thank you.Ron T.

Sam’s dad fallowed in his footsteps and was an entrepreneur and business owner as well. But unfortunately, both Sam’s dad and grandfather passed away before Sam could learn what he needed to do to fallow in their footsteps. That caused Sam to embark on a mission in life to learn everything he could about business and being an entrepreneur.  Sam’s dad was also a singer/guitar player and gave Sam the gift of music early on in life, and music and the guitar have been a lifelong passion of Sam’s.  Even though he rebelled early on in life and did not take very well to traditional education, Sam found he was blessed with an abundance of God given common sense. Couple that common sense with his many years of private study, practical application, and the development of his creative and innovative sides through music, Sam realized that (against all odds), he had developed a knack that even experienced business professionals did not have. Knowing that he had a gift to look outside the box and invasion how things could be, Sam wanted to share it with the world! In the end, Sam says, “My Zen and passion in life and as an entrepreneur is to use my knack to help others achieve their dreams, and that's why I was placed on planet earth”! Although Sam has now been a part of many online market research and business projects, he concludes that his knack is God given. So with the help of people like Sam, let’s make America great again by rekindling The Great American Innovative and Entrepreneurial Spirits!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When William was 5 years old, his mother had to leave his three sisters and him in order to survive. Though it seems like a terrible beginning, small William lived through it and gained great life experience. The will of providence brought him to work as a servant in the house of the great master, Sifu Qian Bo-Wan. His Kung Fu school became his home and shelter. At the age of 8, boys passion for martial arts was recognized and he began learning personally from the great master Bo-Wan. He was trained in various methods: Wing Chun, Shao Lin Guan, Tai Chi Guan, Xing Xi Guam. He studied Chi Kung with my master and Buddhist monks. Just before his Sifu left this world, he told to 14 year old boy: \"Xi (his name for author), you have to go and spread this knowledge. You can do much more then I ever could, you will see.\" Author felt humbled and obligated to carry out his wishes and he did so. After finishing his studies of traditional Chinese medicine with Dr. Le Cai, author moved to the Western world. He often stated that he never understood what his Sifu meant by saying 'you can do much more'. He did not say 'better', but 'more'. He explained that despite spending more then 30 years in teaching martial arts, Chi Kung, and related disciplines just recently he was able to understand why he used the term 'much more'. It was not because of anything in me. It is because of the Internet and modern technology that I really am able to fully fulfill his instructions. I am more than grateful to all my students and readers who help me, and continue reading and using my books. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, and God bless you.", "related": ["B00KGOECLS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Mav Skye takes us on a deep and dark journey into a world of madness and mental illness that borders on the terrifying in The Undistilled Sky. As Phoebe struggles within a world of maddening dreams and hot lava flowing through her brain, she desperately searches for a way to escape it for the sake of her daughter, Dessa Rae. As the horrifying dreams of her family and her home on the farm continue to fuel the madness of her illness, she fights to give her daughter the love she needs and the home that she wishes the child could have. With stress continually mounting with the loss of a job, pressure to fly from Texas to Washington for her sister's wedding, and a perception of being entirely alone in the world, Phoebe measures her options and has to make a choice that might bring her relief, but will leave her child alone in a world of madness.Dark and desperate are the two best words to describe The Undistilled Sky. Mav Skye has brilliantly captured the horrors of a mental illness that is driven by flaming madness. The descriptions, emotions, and thoughts that go through Phoebe's head plunge the reader into the same darkness and leave a feeling of desperation churning in the pit of the stomach. This is a very well-written, well-thought-out masterpiece. Though I have never suffered from this form of mental illness before, this story tracks what others suffering from PTSD have told me. What really grabs the attention most is how very much her mother, in reality, is like the blind pig of Phoebe's nightmare. Dark, desperate and tragic, The Undistilled Sky puts the reader inside the mind of madness.\"", "related": ["B00JQHZRZQ"], "rank": 2109176, "title": "The Undistilled Sky: A Short Story", "author": "Mav Skye", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

Originally a Jersey Girl, she lives with her real-life hero, Bob, in Arizona. They have four children. A former chef, when Carolyn isn’t writing, she's studying her craft, or whipping up some gastronomic delight for family and friends.

Walker, Founder ofNinjaAffiliate SeriesI was a big fan of his other book. This book surely stood up to it's standard. I loved the way, he sited examples from his own experience. I enjoyed reading the chapter about creating an Asian Sales army. It helped me come up with some ideas to create my own affiliate sales army. Overall, it's a great book that talks about the current internet scenario and how you should update your tactics.≧◔◡◔≦ ★★★★★ By Laura Hutchinson, Owner: MiX ClothingAfter wasting over 30k in SEO last year, my site was hit by numerous Google updates. I had no clue if I was hiring the wrong agency or if it was just me who wanted to see quick results on Google. I felt completely hopeless running the cat and mouse game (as the author likes to call it). This book has shown me a brand new way to look at my current marketing strategies. I have taken away a lot from this book. I just need to hire a few VA's now. Thanks a lot Mr. Harshajyoti Das.≧◠◡◠≦✌ ★★★★★ By Jake Polster, FB Marketing SpecialistThis book is such an eye opener. It has completed changed my perspective about internet marketing. Before reading this book, I thought, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest were the only source of good traffic. But I didn't know that there are many other platforms that can be used wisely with the power of proper marketing to create a stream of stable traffic. I do agree with the author that SEO is not dead yet, but it will be dead soon.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 35.0}
