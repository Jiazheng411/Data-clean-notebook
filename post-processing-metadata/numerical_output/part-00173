InReaching the Goal, Dr. John Arthur Ricketts presents a breakthrough management approach that embraces what makes services different: their diversity, complexity, and unique distribution methods. Ricketts draws on Eli Goldratt’s Theory of Constraints (TOC), one of this generation’s most successful management methodologies...thoroughly adapting it to the needs of today’s professional, scientific, and technical services businesses. He reveals how to identify the surprising constraints that limit your organization’s performance, execute more effectively within those constraints, and then loosen or even eliminate them. This book’s relentlessly practical techniques reflect several years of advanced IBM research and consulting with enterprise clients. Step-by-step, Ricketts shows how to apply them throughout your most crucial business functions...from project management to finance, process improvement to sales and marketing. Whatever your role in improving service delivery, processes, or profitability, this book gives you the tools to reach your goals...and go beyond them Identify, manage, and overcome your key constraints    Five steps to uncovering and addressing the real obstacles to improved performanceOptimize core business functions, one step at a time    Improve the way you manage resources, projects, processes, finance, and marketingImplement TOC rapidly and effectively    Get buy-in, deploy infrastructure, and provide the right IT support?", "related": ["B007A6VC04"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jagged blocks of stone along the top of the cliff—all that remained of a ruined wall—reminded her that San Giusto, the southernmost city in the Sea Isles of Illyria, had once needed protection from pirates. Spring was only a few weeks old, and even this far south it wasn't really warm enough to stand by the shuttered window in her pyjamas.But she'd given up trying to get back to sleep. Images from the dream that had jerked her awake still lingered with a sour, humiliating aftertaste. She shivered again, wishing her unconscious would stop replaying the incident over and over again in a never-ending loop.Call her naïve, she thought with a bitterness that startled her, but she'd never for a moment suspected that Durand had any interest in her; three months ago when she'd arrived in London from New Zealand, her employer's partner—in both personal and business senses—had completely ignored her.Leola smiled grimly, remembering how excited she'd been, how confident that this was another step up in her chosen career. After all, Tabitha Grantham was a world-famous brand, noted for the cool sophistication and perfect tailoring of the clothes she designed.And Tabitha herself had contacted Leola after seeing her line at Auckland's Fashion Week.'I like your edge,' she'd said, interviewing her over cocktails in the opulent hotel suite she shared with Durand. 'I think you'll go far and I'd like to help you. You'll learn plenty, but I have to warn you I don't pay my interns much, and I'll expect you to work like a galley slave.'And work her hard she had. Not that Leola had objected. She'd found it exhilarating, bewildering, shocking and fascinating, and she'd soaked up every bit of information she could, every scrap of technique, every contact.Pity it had all come to an abrupt, mortifying end when Jason Durand decided she'd do as his latest fling.Unseeing, her gaze skimmed the dark spires of the cypresses along the ruined wall. Night had worked a transformation on the city. Bustling and noisy and charmingly Mediterranean during the day, San Giusto brooded silently under the Northern hemisphere stars. A violent homesickness gripped her; in New Zealand the stars were familiar and the breeze tangy with a wilder, more primal scent.It was still there, she thought wistfully; she could return any time.In fact, it looked as though she'd be back there pretty soon. If it hadn't been for the godmother who'd given her this week in Illyria as a birthday present she'd be maxing out her credit card right now on airfares.Her head came up proudly. No, she wouldnotslink back with her tail between her legs—or not until she'd exhausted every option. She didn't do defeat.So she'd find new digs first. Without Tabitha's subsidy she couldn't afford the bedsit; she'd had to plead with the landlord to store her suitcases until she came back from this trip.So digs first, a new job next.Her lips tightened in a mixture of outrage and frustration. Dammit, she'd been fighting Durand off when Tabitha walked into the room three days ago, yet it had made no difference.'I'm sorry,' Tabitha had said, her eyes steely, 'but Durand is more important to me than you are. I don't want to see you again.'Of course Durand was a vital part of the business, but it had been Tabitha's callous dismissal—as though Leola had been a Victorian housemaid found pilfering!—that had stung, enough for her to threaten Durand with the police or the press when he'd refused to pay out her final week's wage.That had got her the money, but she'd rather have had the internship.Leola drew in a deep breath of air scented with pine and salt, figs and grape. She was not going to let betrayal or her fear for the future spoil her week in this lovely place, and if she couldn't sleep she might as well work her restlessness off. A brisk walk should do it.Ten minutes later she locked the door of her apartment behind her and strode towards the deep, mysterious shadows at the base of the ancient tower that marked the cliff walk.It was a night from an ancient fable—serenely impersonal sky, the soft sigh of the sea on the rocks at the base of the cliff, a stillness so profound she almost expected to see a nymph flit from one of the trees to join her sisters in classical frolics with dolphins.Yet halfway across the square the skin between Leola's shoulder blades prickled, and she had to resist the urge to swing around and scan the darkened houses behind her.Cravenly glad that she'd worn a dark top over her black jeans, she was relieved to reach the shade of the trees at the foot of the tower. Slowly, telling herself she was being stupid, she turned.Her breath stopped in her throat. From the corner of her eye she spotted a stealthy movement at the base of the church. Someone—or something—was sliding along the ancient stone.So what? It was probably just one of the local dogs coming home from a night on the tiles.So why was adrenalin pumping through her, quickening her senses, ramping up her pulse so that all she could hear was the rapid, heavy thud of her own heartbeat?Because her night-attuned eyes picked out people—a line of them, some stumbling, some walking fast, all noiseless. They seemed to emerge from a deeper darkness in the church wall—a door—and they were heading for the wall.A flare of light shocked her into a gasp; she saw a man's face—handsome, subtly cruel—before the light died.And then she was grabbed from behind in one swift, brutal movement, an iron hand clamping across her mouth so that her scream had no chance to escape. Instinct drove her to a frenzy of struggling desperation, but she was dragged into the pitch blackness of some recess in the wall.Think,she commanded herself, and tried to turn so she could knee her captor in the groin, an assault he blocked with ruthless efficiency. She forced herself to go limp, surreptitiously folding her fingers into a fist, but his arms crushed her against a lean, shockingly strong body, completely subduing her so that she could neither move nor signal.All coherent thought lost to an unnerving panic, she tried biting at the remorseless hand over her mouth, but that didn't work either. It tightened, cutting off her breath.Panic kicked her ferociously in the stomach and she let herself sag. He eased the pressure a little, but she could feel the tension smoking off him.A quiet scraping, then what sounded like a muffled curse in an unknown language—Illyrian?—came from the direction of the square. Every muscle painfully taut, Leola waited for some sign of inattention from the man who held her so fiercely against him; he was big, she realised, as well as hugely powerful, and he…He smelt good.In some wildly illogical way that clean male scent eased her fear a little.Until she was hauled sideways, through what had to be a door in the wall. Barely audible, her captor said in English, 'Don't be frightened.'How did he know she'd understand?He didn't let her go, and he didn't take his hand away from her mouth. If anything, the fingers tightened a fraction. In warning? Forcing down a spasm of terror, Leola waited for him to lose concentration.She couldn't see what was happening, but a faint thud sounded as if he'd kicked the door shut behind them and the air became musty. Shivering, she realised they were inside the tower.'Just another few minutes,' he said again, his words pitched for her ears only. 'Walk.'Instead Leola sagged, hoping he'd think she'd fainted and that she might get a chance to get away.It didn't work. Ruthlessly he propelled her in front of him.'Stairs,' he said, still in that deep, oddly soft voice, half lifting, half dragging her upwards.Once they reached the top would he throw her down the cliff into the sea below? Panic surged again, freezing her mind.All she could think of doing was to pretend to find it hard going, stumbling, hesitating, until he said curtly, 'It's no use. And you're safe enough.'

Paige was devastated when Nathan turned his back on her but never stopped loving him or wishing things had been different. She did the only thing that she could do and tried to move on with her life. Her strength and determination however was no match for the love they once shared. Nathan did what he thought was best at the time and let the woman he loved walk away. When he realized that he couldn't live without love, he makes plans to make things right, but before he can do anything fate steps in and brings what he desires right to his door.Ms. McKade has written a fast-paced story with memorable characters, plenty of heat and a touching plot that is sure to please readers and leave them with a smile on their face. 4 Angels! \"Joyfully Reviewed–  \"Christmas is the time for miracles, including a second shot at happily ever after in this sizzling reunion story by Mackenzie McKade. Nathan and Paige are two people clearly meant to be with one another, but being in love and in lust with one another was never their problem. Old wounds, not to mention Nathan’s manipulative ex, stand in their way. While it’s true that Nathan made major mistakes in his past, the way he cares for his loved ones (particularly Paige and his utterly adorable daughter, Cami) went a long way to him winning me over. Paige, in turn, is a generous and forgiving soul who can’t resist falling back into Nathan’s arms, but at the same time realizes more than he the difficulties they face, in that it isn’t possible to simply pick up where they left off. Ms. McKade knows her way around, under, and through a love scene, and Merry Christmas, Paige definitely shows this. Readers are in for a naughty good time in Kauai as Nathan and Paige make up for five years apart, in every way. I always enjoy Ms. McKade’s books, and Merry Christmas, Paige is no exception.\"Whipped Cream Reviews– \"Ms. McKade writes emotional scenes beautifully, and you’ll need a box of hankies when Nathan and Paige face off for the first time in five years. It’s the initial intensity that snagged my attention and held my interest. Both protagonists are torn-up over the loss of love, but want one another so much your heart will cramp and knot. I had that heavy weight in my chest on more than one occasion, and will readily admit to experiencing that wrench in my gut and sting in my eyes that accompanies the desire to tear up. It doesn’t hurt that the sexual chemistry between the protagonists is so hot you’ll blister and wilt, and considering the length of the work, there is more than enough to satisfy erotica enthusiasts. Five years is an awful long time to burn for someone, and Nathan and Paige more than make up for it when they are reunited. I recommend Merry Christmas, Paige to readers that like stories with that have a fairytale feel but contain enough heat between the sheets to keep the blood pumping.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The stories chronicle pointless intersections between strangers in Manhattan, or odd, inexplicable entanglements among campers or vacationers to Italy or passengers on a train. The young Finnish woman, Lotta, who rents her West Village apartment to the visiting German narrator in \"Flotsam,\" is typically enigmatic: Lotta sleeps most of the time, and on a weekend trip to the seashore with the narrator and his friends, she eventually wanders off with one of the men, moving through life in reaction to the will and aims of others. The stories are narrated with clinical detachment, and are often hauntingly impressionistic, as in \"Black Ice,\" set in a TB hospital ward of an unnamed industrial city, where the narrator, a journalist, seeks out a terminally ill patient to interview over the course of several days. Larissa, a young married woman from Kazakhstan, no longer has visitors and little to engage her beside the TV, and yet to the unmovable narrator (more emotionally dead than she is) she notes, \"Desire never stops.\" Stamm derives his narrative power from absence and void.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was a heavy equipment mechanic. He had years of crane operating experience on diverse construction projects from buildings to roadways and bridges. He drove trucks hauling freight, and cars, across the country. He is an instrument rated pilot and flew for a defense contractor where he was also the head of field service. He designed and set up machining production and supervised welding and maintenance operations. He trained US and Canadian SWAT and Special Response Teams around the country and advised US Anti-terrorist units in the operation and maintenance of armored vehicles. He lectured to high ranking military in the Middle East, the Far East and South America. He assisted troops in the desserts of Saudi Arabia and accompanied military throughout the jungles and Andes Mountains of Venezuela. He dove in the waters off the coast of California with Marines while serving as a consultant during extensive testing of mobile weapons stations. He was a volunteer mounted deputy for several years in the Macomb County Sheriff's Department where he was detailed to guard George H. Bush and Bill Clinton during their '92 presidential campaigns. He also built a civil war army wagon to military specifications and operated it during reenactments. He managed to write this book, not about his experiences as world traveler or military advisor but about hometown adventures. This fictional story takes place in Detroit and northern suburbs and is loosely based on those adventures. The story is about two nonviolent brothers that get caught up in a life of violence for self defense and in defense of family and friends. Also driving them is a desire to avenge the murder of a life-long friend.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The reclusive Count Brass, lord of the former French region Kamarg, enrages the empire when he spurns an offer of alliance. Imperial envoy Baron Meliadus sends defeated rebel Dorian Hawkmoon to kidnap Brass's daughter, Yisselda, but Hawkmoon's inherent morality, his own infatuation with Yisselda, and Brass's kindness lead Hawkmoon to ally with Brass though he knows it spells his own doom. This novel is quite short by modern standards, giving the story a compressed and distilled effect. There is little space for nuanced politics or any depth of characterization, but the action is extremely fast-paced, and Moorcock fits more plot into 224 pages than other authors manage in a dozen volumes.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We fail to take care of ourselves, he points out, and end up undermining our health, happiness, and productivity. Using a series of quadrants describing the emotional workings of both employees and companies, he argues that nothing is gained—and much is lost—by constantly pushing people to achieve more and more in less time and with fewer resources; rejuvenation and rest are necessary for creative breakthroughs and broader perspectives. All well and good, but the bulk of the book is then eaten up exhorting readers to get more sleep, exercise, eat better, and take care of their emotional health. While a reminder to cultivate engagement and mindfulness is always relevant to the modern business reader, the usable content is slim—and fluffed out beyond the point of readability.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Friendly Fire, you have Kendall Frasier a DEA agent who has had a hard time in her life. Seeing her partner shot at by a man she has come to hate doesn't make the vacation any fun considering that the man who shot him is also on the same island. Zane Vincent is a man who exudes raw sexuality and it angers Kendall that she wants him. The sexual chemistry in this book grips your attention as soon as they find out that they're stuck on the same island. More than that, the scenes are hot and steaming to read through. Highly recommended for Megan Hart fans and this reviewer looks forward to another of her stories.\"--Lydia, Fallen Angel Reviews\"...Wonderfully written and absolutely sizzles!...not only hot, but it's a story of dealing with survivor's guilt as well and I highly recommend it.\"--Chere Gruver, Sensual Romance Reviews", "related": ["B006RJ6K9I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 3.8667, "rating_total": 58.0}

He devotes much time to writing and creates art work for educational material. He has always loved the sea and ships and his 65 inch scale model of the tugboat, \"Kathy Sue\" is a testament to his dedication towards the romance of the Sea.     A \"Pacific Northwest Native\", Michael spent many of his early years on the shores of \"Puget Sound\". Raft building was the predominate theme of his day at the beach. As a teen, he was a member of Bellingham's \" Sea Scout\" troop and joined the US Coast Guard in 1959. Upon discharge in 1965, he headed for the ship yards so as to learn how to build them. Retiring from being a \"hotdog pipefitter/welder\", he began college and majored in Drug and Alcohol Counseling and in 1963 was a certified Washington State Drug and Alcohol Counselor.    Working with teens, as he wrote about in the adventures of Calvin Pstone's no smoking 101 cruise, he found that cigarettes were far and away more profound than he and many have found them to be. He began the book, \"No Smoking 101\", in 2005 using his \"Addiction Artwork\" so as to leave the reader with a way to look at smoking in a completely new light. . .no pun intended.    His dream to write a book about his many sea adventures prompted his writing a story that would help or even succeed in throwing a wet blanket on a child's idea of smoking their first cigarette.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

James is a student teacher traveling to his first assignment in a country town, but he puts his dreams (are they his dreams, he wonders, or his parents’?) on hold to give a beautiful hitchhiker a ride. Sophie, the hitchhiker, is returning home to her father and brothers after years of aimless wandering and missed connections, seeking closure, reconciliation, and a voice to express the secrets she has been carrying. James and Sophie bond through their shared uncertainty and begin a sweet and healing romance. James and Sophie narrate in honest, plain voices, but Herrick occasionally brings in the viewpoints of other characters; while this adds a deeper, though perhaps unnecessary, layer with James’ parents, it distracts with one-off characters who exist only to provide backstory. This philosophical coming-of-age tale has a gentle message about making life meaningful by letting go of worries and regret, though it doesn’t stand out too far from other similar tales.

Surra grew up near Chatham, NY, amidst a unique assortment of area writers, musicians, and regular folks. He lived just a stone's-throw from the Woodstock area in one direction, and West Stockbridge in the other. The location attracted a concentration of colorful and even bizarre characters, ranging from a bit unusual to the unapologetically flamboyant.  The local treasure-trove of personalities was, for lack of a better word, hippie-based. Though the flow of thought was encouraged around these types, J.M. vividly remembers his young friends refusing to play with him once, claiming he \"always told such big stories.\"    He came by that honestly. His steel-worker grandfather told him of Scotland and taught him to speak with a proper Scottish brogue (which, despite what his friends think, he never mastered). His Dad told him of how he flew a disabled bomber back to base, and flew it all the way onto the ground, and how badly he was hurt in the crash (his injuries from that plane crash are revisited onto a character in Angels and their Hourglasses). The local VietNam vets told far different, dark and disturbing war stories, and other locals of diverse origins had their own tales to tell.  J.M. was hooked, and wrote stories throughout High School. He loves to play the guitar, and for a long time he wanted to write songs. He says, \"I couldn't write a line short enough to fit into a song. It was maddening. It took some time to recognize my storytelling gene. My mind overflows with epic-length stories. There always seems to be another one waiting to come out.\" In the Mid-80s, J.M. moved to Maine, and again surrounded himself with a colorful cast of characters. He discovered a state filled with a more earthy breed of honest, hard-working people with a seemingly endless supply of dry yet humorous quips, usually spoken in the native downeast accent, \"Ya cahn't get theyah from heeyah..\" or \"Ayuh\", (Mainer for \"Yeah\" or \"Yep\").  He fell in love with Maine and its people, and lived there happily for 25 years. Time flies when you're having fun.  Due to the devastated Maine economy, J.M. has become a Texas transplant, but he still has a home in Maine. Whenever he can steal some time he zips back home to write, hike the Appalachian Trail, take in the vistas, and visit dear friends.", "related": ["B00B9E4TPI"], "rank": 2248189, "title": "Angels and Their Hourglasses eBook", "author": "J.M.

Picking up a jewel dropped by the victim, Faro recalls a similar jewel left by his father, a constable who had died years earlier while investigating a case known as the \"Egyptian Style Curse on Edinburgh Castle.\" According to rumor, a stillborn infant was discovered behind a wall in the chamber where Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to her heir. If an imposter were substituted for the prince, England's rulers have been illegitimate since the 16th century. Faro sets out to learn the truth although he knows that the silence of other investigators has been assured by their \"suicides\" or \"accidental\" deaths.

It is an excellent addition to the scholarly tourism literature. It is a must have book for anyone who is involved in tourism analysis and research.Muzaffer Uysal, PhD.

Fesenmaier, Director, National Laboratory for Tourism & eCommerce, School of Tourism and Hospitality Management, Temple UniversityUnlike other books on this subject, Quantitative Methods in Tourism does not focus on theoretical discussion on presented techniques. It is therefore quite practical and could be successfully used either as a textbook (as an overview of different statistical methods) or as a reference (for more detailed explanation of a particular technique). It could definitely improve the quality and reliability of any research or at least give some inspirational insights on plethora of methods in statistic that could be applied in tourism analysis.Miroslava Dimitrova in European Journal of Tourism Research 4(2), pp. 251-252The book provides thoughtful, insightful Introduction into the logic of many well-known statistical methods used in tourism and some that are not as well known but have significant potential for tourism...Quantitative Methods in Tourism presents fresh and timely information on many of the more important - and some less familiar - techniques useful in tourism research.

He seems to have taken a crack at just about every genre: mysteries, noirish thrillers, historicals, locked-room mysteries, adventure novels, spy capers, men's action, westerns, and, of course, his masterful, long-running Nameless private detective series, now entering its fourth decade, with no signs of creative flagging. He's also ghosted several Brett Halliday short stories as Michael Shayne for Mike Shayne's Mystery Magazine, and has managed to collaborate with such fellow writers as John Lutz, Barry Wahlberg, Collin Wilcox and Marcia Muller. Still, if he never ventured into fiction writing, his non-fiction work, as both writer and editor, would still earn him a place in the P.I. genre's Hall of Fame. Besides his two tributes to some of the very worst in crime fiction (what he calls \"alternative classics\"), Gun in Cheek and Son of Gun in Cheek, and one on western fiction (entitled Six Gun in Cheek, naturally), he's the co-author (with Marcia Muller) of 1001 Midnights. The Mystery Writers of America have nominated him for Edgar Awards several times and his work has been translated into numerous languages and he's published in almost thirty countries. He was the very first president of the Private Eye Writers of America, and he's received three Shamus Awards from them, as well as its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although it was July, the air was still damp and chilly at four in the morning. Her cousin Sarah and her cousin's husband Curt should be here any minute to take her and Sarah to the airport. she and sarah were less than a year apart in age. Sarah's dad was the brother of Lily's late father, and he had done his best to act as a stand-in dad. Although Lily and Sarah had grown up in different suburbs of Philadelphia and gone to different schools and colleges, they had gone to summer camp together and shared major milestones.And now they were sharing a fabulous trip together. Lily shivered again, this time in anticipation. Her first time in Europe! Sarah had studied in France and was a high-school French teacher, but Lily was a total newbie. A European newbie, so to speak.After graduating from college with a somewhat-less-than-lucrative journalism degree with an even-less-lucrative English-literature minor, Lily had decided to remedy a childhood of never going anywhere by starting a modest career as a travel writer. So far, she had done several articles on her native city of Philly and had branched out to New Jersey and New york.But writing articles for the local parenting magazine on top ten historic sites for kids in Philly was shooting fish in a barrel. Adventure lay outside the Tri-State area, so she'd scraped together enough money for a trip to France. Just her and Sarah for the next few weeks.She craned her neck. yes, that was their car, a dark sedan that glided smoothly to the curb. Sarah hopped out…in her pajamas? Comfort was important for flying, but, well, okay. Lily didn't much care what their fellow passengers thought of her cousin's baggy pink T-shirt and red flannel pants, complete with monkeys dangling off palm trees. It was all good, as long as Sarah could pass through security without being tagged for crazy.But Sarah also looked like death warmed over, her short brown bob scraped back by a linty black headband that looked like an Alice in Wonderland reject. Her face was pale even in the dim light, and her lips were dry and cracked.\"Um, are you okay?\" Stomach flu on an international flight would be kind of dicey.Sarah's mouth spread into a wide grin and then she burst into tears of all things, clutching Lily as she sobbed. Curt hopped out of his side of the car and hurried to them. \"What the heck is going on, Curt?\"\"No!\" Sarah jerked her head up, her expression alarmingly close to a snarl. \"Don't you dare say a word!\"Curt and Lily cringed. \"Of course not, darling. It's yours to tell, precious.\" He wrapped his arm around his wife's shoulder and kissed the top of her limp hair.Darling? Precious? Curt was usually about as romantic as a rock.\"Sarah?\" Lily said cautiously. She wasn't sure what was going on, but she had a nonrefundable ticket to Paris leaving in about four hours.Her cousin's face smoothed out until it was almost beatific. \"Lily, I'm pregnant!\"Lily shrieked loud enough to wake the neighbors, who wouldn't bother calling the cops even if it were some mad strangler coming into her apartment. \"Pregnant!\" She started to jump up and down but quickly stopped when she saw the queasy look on Sarah's face.\"I know, I know! After all these years, all those times when it didn't work out…\"Lily gave her a quick kiss, remembering Sarah's several miscarriages until the damn doctors had figured out she'd had a blood clotting disorder all along. This trip to Europe was supposed to be a kind of decompression from the pain and stress of her infertility and losses—no pressure to conceive with a husband five thousand miles away. \"But how did you find out?\"Sarah giggled. \"I'd been feeling kind of off for the past week but I figured it was a touch of flu. Then last night about eight, I started throwing up hard, and Curt was worried. He took me to the E.R. They put in an IV but also ran a pregnancy test.\" She shrugged, her face splitting into a grin. \"And here we are.\"\"Well, of course you can't go.\" Lily wouldn't have her cousin risk her baby on a strenuous overseas trip.Curt's shoulders sagged in relief. He had obviously expected some hassle.\"But, Lily, how will you manage all by yourself? You don't speak a lick of French, and you've never been anywhere.\"Great for her self-confidence. \"Didn't you tell me that if you ever got pregnant again you would need very close prenatal care along with anticoagulant shots right from the start?\"\"Yes,\" Sarah admitted. \"But I feel so terrible about abandoning you.\"\"Please,\" she scoffed. \"I'm a big girl. I have my itinerary and my French phrasebook.\"Sarah winced. Lily had a terrible accent, being unable to master the sheer nasality of the language. \"Well, at this time of year there are always English speakers roaming around if you get into a bind. And Curt and I will take you to the airport like we planned. I wish I had given you more notice than this,\" she fretted.\"I wouldn't change anything,\" Lily told her, and that was the truth. Later on in the pregnancy, when her cousin felt more secure, Lily would inform her she was going to be the godmother. Maybe she would bring back a little French toy for the baby and keep it hidden until he or she was born.Curt loaded her things into the trunk and they headed for the Verrazano Bridge to cross into New York. JFK Airport sat on a bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in Queens. At that early hour, the miles passed quickly and Lily found herself deposited on the sidewalk with all her luggage.Sarah reached her hand out the window to grab her cousin's hand. \"Lily, Lily, please take care of yourself.\" Her eyes were filling up. Lily's were, too, only she didn't have early pregnancy hormones to blame, thank God.She blew Sarah a kiss. \"Everything will be fine. I'll text you once I land. You just concentrate on taking care of yourself—and your baby.\"Sarah waved as Curt pulled away from the curb. Lily took a deep breath and hefted her backpack onto her shoulders before pulling her medium-size rolling suitcase into the terminal.Her first major trip anywhere. France, land of wine and roses, perfume and pomp. Wow, that sounded good. She grabbed her phone and quickly entered that phrase. She had her laptop all tuned up and ready for the great stories that would fall in her lap.Lily was going to take France by storm.Jacques Montford hopped off the Metro stop a few blocks from the family mansion on Rue de Faubourg St-Honoré. His mother, the Dowager Countess de Brissard, had wanted to send the family car to meet him at the airport, but he needed more time. Time to get out of the closeness of the airplane, the craziness of Charles de Gaulle Airport, time to get some fresh air—as fresh as Paris could provide.He climbed the stairs to the street. Ah, theparfum de Parisin the summer. More than a hint of auto exhaust and pollution, but also a touch of garden from behind the high walls he passed. Jasmine, definitely rose and a touch of lily. But no lavender.The only lavender in Paris was in the buckets in the flower market and maybe in a clay pot in some less sophisticated neighborhood than the one he walked through.For real lavender, Jacques would have to leave Paris and go to Provence.The idea of another trip at that point seemed exhausting. More exhausting than staying with his mother in Paris? That remained to be seen.He rounded the corner to the house and took the steps before knocking on the wide wooden door. He hadn't bothered to take his key ring on his trip to the Southeast Asian typhoon disaster area. As a relief-work physician, he'd had plenty of important medical supplies to carry with him. It was typical to bring one backpack of personal items and a couple of large suitcases filled with medicine, bandages and emergency surgical instruments. In fact, he was wearing his trusty backpack right now. He couldn't wait to drop it in his suite of rooms, take a shower and grab something to eat in the large kitchen. A quick knock, the door opened and he was officially in hell.\"Surprise!\" A crowd full of people he didn't know greeted him, slapping him on the back and shaking his hand.His mother, her hair an exact color match for his thanks to the hairdresser, fought her way to him, kissing him on both cheeks twice and crying prettily, though not enough to either ruin her mascara or redden her eyes. \"Jacques!Mon petitJacques is finally home!\" she announced. His mother's guests cheered again.He was a rich lady's prize poodle being trotted out for admiration.And for his next trick, he will administer oral rehydration salts and give measles vaccinations!He felt like turning around and leaving. But the crowd filled in behind him and Bellamy was taking his beat-up backpack from him.His mother clutched his shoulders. \"Ah, Jacques, your hair. Why so long?\" She fingered his long ponytail of chestnut-brown hair. \"Andla barbethat hides your handsome face?\" She tapped his beard. \"You look like one of those scruffy men who live in the subway.\" She, of course, was impeccably turned out in a flowing silk peach-colored lounge suit, the perfect outfit for an evening party at home.\"Maman,please.\" He took her hand away from his face but kissed the back of it so she wouldn't fuss.She dimpled at him. \"Someone else is waiting to kiss you,\" she said coyly.He had no idea who. \"Bellamy?\" He was their ancient butler and the idea of being kissed by the old English fossil made him crack the first smile of the evening.Unfortunately his mother misunderstood. \"oh, you funny boy. But that smile tells me you know who I mean....", "related": [], "rank": 515695, "title": "Royally Seduced (A Real Prince)", "author": "Marie Donovan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Only with the perspective of history can we see that the emperors were wrong, that the empire was failing, and that the Roman people were unwilling or unable to change their way of life before it was too late. The same, says Morris Berman, is true of twenty-first century America. The nation and its empire are in decline and nothing can be done to reverse their course. How did this come to be?In Why America Failed, Berman examines the development of American culture from the earliest colonies to the present, shows that the seeds of the nation's \"hustler\" culture were sown from the very beginning, and reveals how the very tools that enabled the country's expansion have become the instruments of its demise.At the center of Berman's argument is his assertion that hustling, materialism, and the pursuit of personal gain without regard for its effects on others have been powerful forces in American culture since the Pilgrims landed. He shows that even before the American Revolution, naked self-interest had replaced the common good as the primary social value in the colonies and that the creative power and destructive force of this idea gained irresistible momentum in the decades following the ratification of the Constitution. As invention proliferated and industry expanded, railroads, steamships, and telegraph wires quickened the frenetic pace of progress—or, as Berman calls it, the illusion of progress. An explosion of manufacturing whetted the nation's ravenous appetite for goods of all kinds and gave the hustling life its purpose—to acquire as many objects as possible prior to deathThe reign of Wall Street and the 2008 financial meltdown are certainly the most visible examples today of the negative consequences of the pursuit of affluence. Berman, however, sees the manipulations of Goldman Sachs and others not as some kind of aberration, but as the logical endpoint of the hustler culture. The fact that Goldman and its ilk continue to thrive in the wake of the disaster they wrought simply proves that it is already too late: America is incapable of changing direction.Many readers will take exception to much of Why America Failed—beginning, perhaps, with its title. But many more will read this provocative and insightful book and join Berman in making a long, hard reassessment of the nation, its goals, and its future.", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whenever she saw a marine in dress blues, she remembered Joe standing at attention—so handsome with his perfect profile and fine features. If he hadn't been involved in so many secret operations, they could have used his gorgeous face for recruitment posters.Her cab drove along Constitution Avenue, and she peered through the rear window, trying to see the National Christmas Tree in the Ellipse outside the White House. During the holiday season, she missed Joe like crazy. They had always attended the ceremonial lighting of the tree. They'd shopped together for presents, danced together at dozens of holiday galas. Their Christmases had been all about silver bells and snowball fights and hot buttered rum in front of the fireplace.That was then. This was now.She sank back in the seat. Starting with the New Year, she vowed to get on with her life. Not that she'd been standing still for five years. As the single mother of a four-and-a-half-year-old son, she seldom got the chance to sit down, and her small catering business had grown into a successful event-planning enterprise. When it came to mothering and working, she was holding her own. It was her personal life that sucked. In five years, she'd only been on a handful of dates, none of which had turned out well. None of those men were Joe.This year would be different. She'd give herself the chance to meet a special man. It shouldn't be that hard; she was only thirty-two and not bad looking, with black hair and blue eyes. She deserved a mate. And her son deserved a father.Exiting her cab outside the National Museum of American History, she heard a group of strolling carolers. The tenor sounded just like Joe; he had loved to belt out a rock-and-roll version of \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town.\"Dusk came early in December. She glanced over her shoulder toward the towering Washington Monument, already lit and gleaming. Then she saw something that made her look twice. Her eyes were lying. This couldn't be. She looked again.There he was. Joe was walking toward her. She recognized his square shoulders and long stride. In spite of the chill, his trench coat was unbuttoned. He had never minded the cold.The rational part of her mind told her that she was wrong. Joe was dead, buried at Arlington. But she couldn't control her imagination. Her heart skipped. Her fingers lost their grip on her briefcase.She wanted to run to him and throw herself into his arms. He'd lift her off the sidewalk and twirl her in a circle. And they'd be happy again.As he came closer, she stared—knowing that he wasn't Joe but hoping for a miracle. He was less than ten feet from her. Their gazes locked, and she saw him clearly. His was the face of a stranger—a young man in his early twenties. Joe would have been thirty-eight by now. Clearly, she was losing her mind.The stranger smiled politely, picked up her briefcase and placed it in her hands. \"Merry Christmas,\" he said. \"Same to you.\"Not Joe, he wasn't Joe, of course, he wasn't.Though she felt like melting into a weepy puddle on the sidewalk, Tess pulled herself together. She straightened the lapels on her burgundy wool winter coat, tucked her shoulder-length hair behind her ears and firmly grasped the handle of her briefcase as she ascended the stairs into the museum. With every stride across the marble floors, the heels of her sensible black pumps clicked, and she gathered herself. She couldn't afford to act like a delusional, sentimental mess. This was business.In less than a week, on Christmas Eve, Tess was responsible for a sit-down dinner for three hundred in the second floor Flag Hall. The sponsor of this event—Governor Lila Lockhart of Texas—was celebrating the donation of several artifacts to the Smithsonian as well as thanking some of the top donors to Texans in Congress. Tess had never handled such a prestigious event, and she wanted to get every detail right.In the waiting area outside the office of the Special Events Coordinator, she greeted the governor's aide, Stacy Giordano, with a hug. A curvy brunette with incredibly long legs, Stacy was glowing in her first trimester of pregnancy. Her wedding was scheduled for New Year's Eve in Texas, and Tess had used her contacts to arrange for a fabulous five-tiered cake.\"How's your little boy?\" Tess asked.\"Doing better than I am. Morning sickness is no fun.\"The last time they'd met, she and Stacy had talked about their kids, who were almost the same age. Stacy's son was autistic. \"Did you bring him along on this trip?\"\"He's here. We're staying with Lila's family at the Pier-pont House in Arlington.\"Tess's home and office were in Arlington, and she was familiar with the Pierpont—a Colonial-style mansion used by visiting dignitaries. The house came with its own maids and cooks. \"Nice place. Has Governor Lockhart arrived?\"\"Not yet. She won't be here until the day before the event. I came with Harlan.\" When she spoke the name of her fiance, Stacy's cheeks flushed a bright, happy red. \"He's setting up security at the Pierpont and for the event. His concerns are the reason for this meeting.\"\"How so?\"\"He wants blueprints for the museum so he can check all entrances and exits, including the basement storage areas.\"This request might be difficult to fulfill. Homeland Security got very nervous when it came to protecting national treasures like those that were housed in the museum. \"I'm not sure if we can get clearance.\"\"Not even for Corps Security and Investigations?\"\"If it was up to me, no problem.\"Tess respected the reputation of CSaI, a private security firm based in Freedom, Texas. All the operatives were highly-trained, former military men. For the past several months while protecting Governor Lockhart, CSaI had dealt with death threats, bombings and snipers. From what Tess had heard, their actions had been competent and skillful.The real reason she held CSaI in high regard was their founder—Bart Bellows. The 75-year-old Bellows was a Vietnam vet, a former CIA agent, a billionaire and the kindest man she'd ever known.When Joe first went missing, Bellows had contacted her. Though he couldn't tell her Joe's assignment, he'd given her the impression that her husband had been vital in disarming a terrible threat to national security. Joe was a hero. But she'd already known that.Instead of merely offering sympathy, Bart had stayed close to her for several days. In spite of his wheelchair, he'd helped in her catering kitchen. It was Bart who had notified her of Joe's death and arranged for him to be buried at Arlington. He'd also sorted through the mountains of paperwork to make sure she received the proper benefits and the payouts from other insurance policies. Bart had been with her in the hospital four months later when Joey was born.She thought of him as her guardian angel, but he wasn't all sweetness and light. More than once, he'd dragged her out of depression and forced her to stand on her own two feet.While acknowledging her grief, he encouraged her potential. Her move from catering into the more lucrative field of event planning came as a result of his contacts. In fact, he was the person who'd recommended her to Governor Lockhart.For the past several weeks, Bart had been missing. When she thought of what might be happening to him, she shuddered. He was such a good man. Life truly was unfair. \"Any news on Bart?\"\"The guys have a couple of promising leads. If anyone can rescue him, they can.\"Tess hoped and prayed that Stacy was right.Nolan Law peered through his infrared, night vision goggles at an isolated flat-roof metal warehouse located eighteen miles outside Austin. A big, black Cadillac pulled up and parked outside the building. The Caddy cut its lights. Nobody got out.From his surveillance position on a low ridge under the spreading branches of a live oak, Nolan could see a long way down the two-lane road leading to this warehouse. Another vehicle approached—an SUV. He parked behind the Caddy. Four armed men emerged and dispersed, setting up a perimeter at the four corners of the small warehouse with only one loading dock.Through his ear bud, Nolan heard the smooth, calm voice of Wade Coltrane. \"Is that everybody that's coming to the party?\"\"Don't know.\" Nolan glanced to his left. He knew Coltrane was out there, but the man was invisible. \"I didn't send out the invites.\"The third man in their attack group, Nick Cavanaugh, said, \"If we'd gotten here sooner, I could have set up some explosive charges inside.\"\"I should think you had enough of bombs,\" Nolan said. Last month, Cavanaugh and his lady had nearly been blown to bits by an explosive device in her son's day care center.\"I'm just saying,\" Cavanaugh muttered. \"More time would have made this easier.\"\"Couldn't be helped.\" Nolan had gotten his intel from their CIA contact less than an hour ago. They'd been short on time, lucky to beat the Caddy and hide their Jeep in a gully behind the ridge.The doors to the Caddy swung open. Two more bodyguards in dark windbreakers emerged from the front. From the back came a man in a suit with a white shirt that gleamed in the moonlight. On his arm was a blonde woman in a short, tight, red dress. Her presence was unexpected and would require an adjustment in strategy.The suit and the woman went up the concrete stairs to an office door beside the loading dock and went inside. A single light over the door went on, casting a glow on the two men in windbreakers who stood directly outside.\"Hold your positions,\" Nolan said. \"Let's give them half...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The movement called Occupy Wall Street had received precious little media attention until Saturday, October 1, 2011, when an idea that arose atAdbusters--a semi-obscure, anti-capitalist magazine based in Vancouver, BC--galvanized hundreds of New York City protesters, who then attempted nothing more than to march across one of the most hallowed symbols of accomplishment in the United States. On the bridge itself, police arrested more than 700 protesters, as is now well known, and thanks to viral videos, the whole world was watching. InThe Battle of the Brooklyn Bridge, Will Bunch captures the spirit of the day from the sympathetic viewpoint of those who claim that \"We are the 99%.\" And how. His extended essay--part reportage, part oral history--nails the screaming immediacy of the events with the eloquence of scholar and the pace of a straightforward thriller. As of its publication date, the long-term import of this event has yet to play out, but Bunch's gripping narrative of the day's events will provide a lasting testament to those who were there, and an eye-opening call to attention for the rest of us. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00BAWAU5W"], "rank": 653902, "title": "October 1, 2011: The Battle of the Brooklyn Bridge (Kindle Single)", "author": "Will Bunch", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The last time he was employed to profit he was living in his parents’ basement, waking early each morning to try to eradicate the 50 different species of mosquita residing in the many marshes and wetlands around his hometown. After three long seasons of filling hoppers rigged to the side of a crop-duster chopper and tromping waist-deep through sedge, muck, and razor grass, he left for Korea to teach.  He found his life in Korea too filled with the boozes of bad bars and the snot of sick school children to remain, so he went home, vowing never to return.  He did so twice more.  Once for a girl who needed to see the world, and then again for a wife who hadn’t gotten enough of it.  In between his Korea years, Rapacz has worked steadily at jobs that never pay enough, complained often, drank too much beer, watched too much television, set aside too many good books, spent too much time indoors and in cities, and tried his best to write something that made sense to somebody.  Currently, he does all the aforementioned, but he is back in Minnesota, ever-fearing the tenacious mosquita of the marshes, but now before his hand slaps down, smearing blood, he first says to each and every one of them bloodsuckers, “There’s another side to this here land.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The focus is not purely on magic and mythical creatures but on real world situations the readers can relate to. He believes the characters and story should lead a novel and without a connection to the characters a story will not strike a chord with a reader.

The following year, the Queen signed a charter allowing male undergraduates to be admitted. She read honours Zoology, then went on to the School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool University for an M.Sc. Her Ph.D. from Brunel University, London was on biological clocks in the malaria mosquito. In the USA, she worked in the Entomology Department at the University of California-Berkeley on biological control of mosquitoes. The success of this research meant that the state of California had an ecological alternative for insect control rather than harmful pesticides, such as DDT. She later worked for the chairman in the Division of Biological Control and did a lot of work on his book, The Pesticide Conspiracy. After living in Zurich, Switzerland, where her husband was a student at the C.G. Jung Institute, the family (+ 3 children) moved to Madison, Wisconsin. There, she worked for the University of Wisconsin-Madison in various departments doing research, administration, teaching and grant writing. She was a successful recipient of Federal funding and became President of a university spin–off company (BioAssay, Inc.) to develop a brief test for environmental chemical contaminants, examining the effects on the next generation.  She later took off for China when all funding dried up. There she taught parasitology and cell biology to international students in the Medical School at Soochow University, Suzhou. She was also student advisor and liaison between Chinese university authorities and international students. Although she has published research papers and a chapter in a scientific book, this is her first book based on her experiences in China.

After cataloguing thousands of celebrities and reading hundreds of charts, Mary fully accepts that astrological placements and movements impact each individual. The celestial sphere proves one of Nature's many guiding cycles.Sun Sign vs. Full Birth-Chart.The most comprehensive celestial snapshot of your potential comes from a full astrological birth-chart based on time of birth and referencing all solar system planets. The zodiac location of the Sun at your birth indicates far less but remains meaningful. Your Sun sign describes your core energy, the driving life-force that underlies the rest of your personality.Self-Knowledge vs. Prediction.The better use of astrology is as a tool for self-knowledge. You are not the same as other people; how can you build upon your personal talents while minimizing your weaknesses? Astrology's prediction of favorable and unfavorable periods is most accurate when calculated from a full astrological birth-chart.Free Will vs. Determinism.Astrology suggests rather than dictates. As if playing a hand of cards, you remain free to choose your responses and actions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Four years of his life were spent in Iran and England, and he has traveled extensively in Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia - experiences that are reflected in both his fiction and non-fiction work. His career experiences include five years as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, employment with one of the nation's leading semi-conductor industries, presidency of a community college, and a university professorship. In addition to his writing, he now works as a consultant/coach for a number of colleges across the United States. He and his wife Holly are avid travelers, gardeners, and conservationists, and live in an eco-friendly home in rural southwest Missouri.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I believe my love of medieval knights came about when my father built a wooden shield and sword for me to use in elementary school for some event. Through my school years I read hundreds (or thousands? - it's hard to recall at this point) of fantasy and science fiction novels.  Comic books and super heroes came a bit later, although I recall seeing the Christopher Reeve Superman movies at a very young age (and loving them).  Since my later teens I believe I've watched nearly every major fantasy, science fiction, and super-hero movie that has come out. I still love reading fantasy and science fiction, although I wish there were more novels based on superheroes.  This is something that drove me to create my own supers universe and heroes in written form.  I love supers, but I've always wanted more character depth than a comic book can provide.  (Not to mention the immense length of time it takes for a comic series to do a story is just plain too long to me.) Writing is a hobby for me, I'm a full-time computer programmer and systems administrator for a small company.  Fortunately the skills I've learned allow me to work with 3D programs to render the characters (and covers) for my books.  My hope is to put out a novel or two a year, time allowing.  At this point I'd like to grow the H.E.R.O. Universe with more novels, as well as start a fantasy series at some point.", "related": ["B00EODEPBY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

As the former chief of emergency at New York Downtown Hospital (only three blocks from Ground Zero) during the events of September 11, 2001, he has the practical experience and exposure that few clinicians possess in this field.A graduate of Bowdoin College Magna Cum Laude with a BA in biology and art history, and with post-graduate studies at the University of Chicago in medical sociology and hospital administration, culminating in receiving his MD in 1985 from University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Residency Trained in Emergency Medicine at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York City under New York Medical College, Dr. Goldschmitt received his board certification in 1990.Immediately upon graduation from his residency program, he became the interim director of Emergency Medicine at Metropolitan Hospital after the untimely death of the original director, Dr. Ralph Altman, a visionary and pioneer in the field of Emergency Medicine. He held that post for one year until a replacement director could be found, and then remained as assistant director of the Emergency Department and Emergency Medicine Residency Program for the next eight years.During that time, he was also liaison to the NYC EMS (prior to the relocation of EMS into FDNY). During that time, he worked at several emergency departments as a clinical attending physician, which led him to New York Downtown Hospital in 1996.One year later, he became director of the Emergency Department and the EMS Paramedic Unit, a position he held for eight years, recently stepping down to an attending physician position in order to pursue other interests, such as writing. Prior to September 11th, Dr. Goldschmitt orchestrated the training of the hospital staff in incident command disaster management, and helped to shape the policies on disaster preparedness. The hospital was in the forefront of such training and expertise, spurred on by the fi rst World Trade Center bombing in 1993, when almost four hundred casualties were treated at the Hospital.On September 11th, 2001, as director of Emergency at New York Downtown, Dr. Goldschmitt helped create and manned the Triage Center at 1 Liberty Plaza next to the World Trade Center. He also coordinated the aftermath programs at New York Downtown Hospital. For the next three days, until the arrival of the Federal Assistance, he helped supply all of the Triage Centers with supplies, equipment, and manpower through the hospital.To this day, he has survivor guilt that he was not already at the hospital when the planes struck, and was able to reach the hospital only after the 1,200 casualties were brought to his emergency department within the fi rst two hours. But he is extremely proud of his staff who, despite all odds, successfully treated even the most critically injured with few casualties.He designed and constructed the first mass decontamination center specifically for non-university hospitals, capable of being retrofi tted in an existing ambulance bay or loading dock. To that point, the only designs available were for large hospitals, requiring the construction of a separate wing. A working decontamination center was completed at New York Downtown Hospital in 2006 utilizing his design.Dr. Goldschmitt has provided lectures to the Department of Health and the Canadian Trauma Symposium in Toronto, as well as many private venues. He continues to be a strong advocate of the role of Emergency Medicine in Disaster Planning and Management.Robert Bonvino, MD, was appointed to the American Medical Association Political Action Committee (AMPAC) Board of Directors in 2000. In 2004, he was selected to be secretary of the AMPAC Board of Directors, chair of the Congressional Review Committee, and AMPAC liaison to the AMA Council on Legislation. He also serves on the AMPAC Executive Committee and the Membership Committee. In addition to being an OB/GYN, Dr. Bonvino is the vice president of Government Affairs and Corporate Development for the New York Downtown Hospital in New York City.Dr. Bonvino received his medical degree from the University of Bologna in Italy and completed his internship and residency at St. Vincent’s Medical Center of Richmond, Staten Island, New York. His experience includes working as the attending OB/GYN and Residency Review Committee Liaison at the New York Downtown Hospital, and also as chief of OB/GYN Outpatient Services at Staten Island’s Bayley Seton Hospital from 1993 to 1997.For many years, Dr. Bonvino has been involved in organized medicine, serving in leadership positions. Since 1994, he has been an American Medical Association AMA) delegate. Dr. Bonvino is currently on the board of trustees of the Medical Society of the State of New York (MSSNY) and a board of director’s member of the political action committee (MSSNYPAC). He served as MSSNY president from 2001 to 2002 and as president of the Medical Scientifi c and Educational Foundation from 1996 to 2000. Dr. Bonvino served as president of the Richmond County Medical Society (RCMS) from 1991 to 1992, and as a RCMS executive committee member and RCMS delegate to the MSSNY from 1983 to present.On September 11, 2001, Dr. Bonvino was involved in the medical response team at Ground Zero in New York City. He has participated in forums discussing the perspectives of disaster and medical community response efforts.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a gospel different in both character and intent from the others in its theme of how, in the person of Jesus, the eternal God walked with us in time, place, and culture, and in so doing, drew us into a life-giving relationship with himself.If the language of this volume is charmingly and unapologetically archaic, its message is all the deeper, filled with remarkable insights. This is no academic treatise. It is a passionate, section-by-section exploration of the riches contained in the book of John, written by a man who had spent fifteen years studying and teaching on the topic. The author’s goal is not merely to inform us, but to draw us into a deeper intimacy with Jesus marked by the same love for and knowledge of him that illuminates these pages.", "related": ["B00FNGQB8Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Watkins was born April 1st in Chicago, Illinois. She obtained a Bachelors of Arts with Focus in Psychology from DePaul University and Masters of Applied Professional Studies with focus in Business Administration from the like institution. Working in Hospital Administration for the majority of her career, Watkins has also been an author of fiction literature since the young age of nine. Eventually she used writing as an outlet during her freshmen year of high school as a single parent: “In the third grade I entered a short story contest with a fiction tale of an apple tree that refused to grow despite the efforts of the darling main character. My writing evolved from apple trees to my seventh and eighth grade classmates paying me to read novels I wrote about kids our age living the lives our parents wouldn’t dare let us”. At the age of twenty-nine, Watkins’ chronicles have matured into steamy, humorous, and realistic tales of women’s fiction. She hopes that the Femistry series will successfully emulate ideal femininity while tackling stereotypes, familiar heartache, and relatable distress in a humorous and sophisticated fashion. Jessica N. Watkins is available for talks, workshops, and book signings. Email her for more information at jessica@femistrypress.net. Additional information can be found at www.jessica-n-watkins.com.

From the start, Sarah was compelled to write. As a little girl, she was mesmerized by her great grandmother’s handwriting and would imitate it on any surface in sight.     At the age of seven Sarah participated in her first school writing competition and won with an essay on the use of balance in Martial Arts. Even at such an early age, Sarah recognized her talent. During her childhood she explored her talent by writing short mystery fiction. During her teenage years, she dabbled in poetry.      Throughout her academic career, Sarah’s talent was recognized by teachers urging her to pursue a life in writing. In her eyes, writing was a personal form of expression, a means of escape.      In the spring of 2009, Sarah sought to accomplish her first novel. Raising two children and working a full time job left little time for the project. Ten months later the first draft was finished.

Although convinced he would never write anything more than a grocery list, he has managed to put together enough words to make a novel. In fact, what was once a short story he wrote in High School, has now blossomed into three interconnected series of books. Sally Singletary's Curiosity has received rave reviews from early readers! The sequel, Sally Singletary's Discovery is scheduled for release in early 2014. Also be on the lookout for Elements of Eaa: Tears of Destiny.In addition to writing, J.M. Cataffo also runs the Eaa Learning Foundation, a site devoted to all things education and how to improve our classrooms for our children. If you're interested in teaching materials, he has some great educational lessons and activities for teachers and parents. He is a pioneer for public education and teacher perception. His latest initiative is theiTeach ∴ iAm initiative whose sole purpose is to encourage positive perceptions of teaching and education. He is currently working on a non-fiction guide to Co-Teaching and how it can benefit students in the classroom.J.M. Cataffo has worked in education for over 15 years and his favorite part of his job is teaching writing. In Special Education it's sometimes difficult to get a child who has a great deal of difficulty with writing to compose a story and he prides himself in building the confidence and skills necessary for students to succeed. Recent advances in technology, along with some good old fashioned tried and true methods, have given these students a chance to express themselves in a way they never could before. It's exciting to see kids who no one thought could ever compose a story, write something that is beautiful and insightful.His challenge to you: Never underestimate a person's potential to do things you never thought they could.", "related": ["B00BVCZNFI"], "rank": 1814052, "title": "Sally Singletary's Curiosity", "author": "J.M.

Blood from the wound on Janet's neck left a  wide, red smear across the glass as she slid sideways and fell to her knees. She looked up at the spectators beyond the glass. Black disks in a  sea of red stared through them sending a chill up Dr. Brooks' spine. Officer Powers, Dr. Brooks and Alex slowly crept forward while Stu and Nurse Bartlett stood near the opposite wall. They both wished that the black tiled hallway were wider.\"What do you make of this, doctor?\" Powers asked out of the side of his mouth not wanting to lose sight of the dead and bloodied woman beyond the glass. He hoped that the  answer from the doctor was going to be a good one. He had his own opinion of the scene. He hoped he was wrong.\"Wasn't in any of the books I studied at medical school,\" Dr. Brooks replied.\"That  wasn't the answer I was hoping for. What do you want to do?\" Powers asked the doctor. As far as Alex, Stu and Nurse Bartlett were concerned,  any answer that meant opening that door wasn't going to make any one of  them a winner on 'Let's Make A Deal'. It seemed that in this situation,  there was only a 'Door Number One', and it led straight to hell.\"I'm  going to open the door,\" the doctor answered without much thought. Alex  turned and looked at Stu and Nurse Bartlett. They looked back with dread on their faces, trying to become one with the wall. Officer Powers  absentmindedly played with the handle of his revolver.\"Officer Chambers told me before he left that whatever I was to do I was not to enter that room,\" he said as he turned to face Dr. Brooks. Janet stared up at them through the bottom of the window with dead eyes. Her black tongue was testing the cool surface of the glass.\"When Officer Chambers left, she was dead,\" the doctor said. \"Now she isn't.\"\"And why is that Doctor Brooks?\" Powers asked. \"You haven't had any good answers so far.\"\"I  don't know... medicine isn't perfect,\" the doctor replied. It was a lame answer, and Powers knew it. He was sure that the doctor also knew it.Janet struggled to her feet. She backed up and made a run for the window. Slamming into the reinforced glass with a sickening splat, she fell to the floor out of view.\"Well, maybe that did it,\" Officer Powers said as he put his face to the glass and tried to peer over the edge of the lower sill. Fingers clawed at the bottom edge of the window frame as Janet pulled herself up onto her knees. She pressed her once pretty, now bloodied face against the windowpane. One black eye stared at the people in the hallway. It was as if she was beckoning them to come in and play.\"Okay, we need to do something to help her,\" Officer Powers said, not sure of his decision.\"I'll  unlock the door and let you in,\" Dr. Brooks said as he pulled the keys on the chain away from his belt. \"Stu, you go with Officer Powers to help him hold her down.\"\"Wha...,\" Stu uttered. The rest of the word was stuck in his dry throat. Alex walked down the hallway and took a  fire extinguisher from the wall. He returned and stood next to a nervous Stu Frazier as Dr. Brooks put the key in the lock. He unlocked the door and turned the handle.\"Ready?\" he asked Officer Powers and the orderly.\"Not really,\" Stu said with trepidation in his voice. Dr. Brooks opened the door.Janet Barnes stepped away from the window and watched as the two men entered the morgue.Sarah  Bartlett was still trying to become a part of the back wall when Dr. Brooks closed the door and locked it. Stu suddenly thought that closing and locking the door was not part of the deal. The doctor left the key in the lock as Alex stood behind him, the extinguisher at the ready.Stu  Frazier suddenly wished that he had taken the night off. He walked slowly over and picked up the sheet from the floor thinking that they might be able to tie it around Janet to subdue her. He made sure not to lose contact with her shark like staring eyes and readied the sheet as Officer Powers approached the bloodied woman near the window. Janet stood, wavering as the two men tried to figure out her next move.\"Okay,\"  Officer Powers said, his arms extended, the palms facing Janet, as if he was approaching a crazy person. He thought that he was in control of the situation. Little did he know Janet had been in control, since he, and Stu had joined her in the room. What was going to happen next would be something akin to feeding time at the local zoo. Janet leapt.\"Open  the door,\" Officer Powers yelled just before Janet Barnes hit him squarely in the chest. Stu dropped the sheet and retreated to the farthest corner of the morgue he could find. He slid down the wall until  he was sitting with his knees nearly touching his chest. He had his arms wrapped around his shins and he was screaming like a child.", "related": [], "rank": 3350339, "title": "The Lazarus Jar", "author": "Daniel  Russell", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But the settling down bug caught up with me. I returned to New Zealand, husband in tow, bought a house, started up a business in the fashion industry and had a baby.  For many years we worked, worried, renovated houses and homeschooled our son who now has a degree in architecture and is studying for a second degree in design, specialising in photography. We currently live in a house overlooking the Pacific Ocean and I work in real estate. In my free time, I am a photographer and food blogger. www.strandsofmylife.com  is a blog about my food journey towards great health. In my other free time, I write books. Writing is a channel for ideas and feelings which manifest themselves in words to create a story with the ability to make readers feel. I hope I manage to stir the emotions in readers which I experience while writing my novels. I now have eight published books.  I read all the time – anything from women’s fiction to thrillers.

They are always such a great escape, making you fall in love many times over again. However, there is one thing I love best about her stories. It's the way she makes family important in every one of her books. You don't just feel the romantic love, but also the loyalty and undying love the characters have for their siblings as well. If you have a soft spot for big families, then the Sullivans must be a series you check out. Just be prepared to want to marry into the family, because their love feels majestic and untouchable.\" ~Annie from Under The Covers Book Reviews\"Rafe has taken my breath away...I absolutely adore Bella Andre and the way that she combines eroticism with love; laughter with love....Yes, it all stems around love - the love of a good man, the love of a wonderful family and the love of your life.

There is usually a romance and there are always characters her readers like and would enjoy having as friends.Most of all, there is a story because what Florence does best is tell stories. Well plotted stories that carry the characters towards a logical conclusion that always includes a happy ending.  Stories that shine light on the human condition while they celebrate the world we live in.  Stories that her readers relate to and remember long after the reading is over.She writes about people who are as normal as apple pie (most of them, anyway) who unexpectedly find themselves in the middle of situations ranging from the heartwarming through the difficult and all the way to the horrendous. But Florence's characters choose to act instead of running away. In the process, they survive, thrive, overcome whatever obstacles large or small are thrown in front of them, and while they are at it, they find time to fall in love.Florence was born in the city and has lived in the suburbs, small towns, the country and the wilderness, where she still lives with her husband and a cowardly cat named Smoke.At various times in her career she's been a confession writer, a copywriter, a ghost writer and an editor. She writes short stories, novellas and novels.  Her work has been categorized as romance, science-fiction, fantasy, mainstream and eco-fiction, to name a few genres that it fits beautifully into.", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": 51507, "title": "Down From the Mountain eBook", "author": "Florence Witkop", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

It’s always been a dream of mine to actually write a novel. It’s been number one on my bucket list for as far back as I can remember. I’ve had many ideas for novel topics, but ultimately I went with something close to my heart- first love… first love and lots of family drama. After all, who doesn’t remember their first love? And who hasn’t had to deal with some family drama in their lives? I know for me, both have been huge influences in my life. With that said, I’m extremely happy to say that I have finally succeeded in completing my first novel, a young adult fiction.

Anyone wishing to understand Syria must understand the long and bitter history of the Muslim Brotherhood's struggle with the Assad regime. Islamic groups are poised to take power in Syria and the Brotherhood is foremost among them. Westerners and Syrians alike who fail to appreciate the importance and centrality of the Brotherhood to Syria's modern history are foolish.\" --Joshua M. Landis, Director, Center for Middle East Studies, University of Oklahoma, and authorSyria Comment\"To understand the blood-letting in Syria there is no better guide than Raphaël Lefèvre s brilliant, wonderfully-sourced and timely book. He demonstrates that the current vicious civil war is but the latest phase of a fifty-year struggle between the Muslim Brothers and the secular Ba th Party, which seized power in Damascus in 1963, overturning Syria s centuries-old socioeconomic and political order.\" --Patrick Seale, author ofThe Struggle for Syria and Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East\"A fascinating study that unravels the complexity of dynamics between radical and more moderate currents within the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, and its most radical offshoots that were primarily responsible for prematurely provoking the Ba'th regime into the tragic bloodbath of Hama in 1982. Lefèvre explains how today's Syrian Revolution provided the Brotherhood with a golden opportunity to make a historical comeback to the forefront of Syrian politics, after decennia of relentless repression by the Syrian Ba'th regime.\" --Nikolaos van Dam, author ofThe Struggle for Power in Syria: Politicsand Society Under Asad and the Ba'th Party, and former Ambassador of the Netherlands to Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, Germany and Indonesia\"A timely and essential history ... [Ashes of Hama]'s great strength is the way in which it sets the Syrian story of the Brotherhood in the context of the place, firmly rooted in the country's tumultuous, often violent post-colonial history.\" -- Frederick Deknatel,The National\"Raphaël Lefèvre's book sheds valuable light on the Islamist movements that seem poised to take power in a post-Ba'th Syria. It draws on new primary sources, such as interviews with and memoirs of Brotherhood leaders and Western government archives. The definitive study of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, it also throws new light on its jihadi offshoots.\" --Middle East Journal\"An impressive and unprecedented compendium of research.\" --New York Journal of Books", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This worked for the first 50,000 words, when I realized the characters had been given too much leeway and I needed to take control of the writing before it got too far out of hand. I basically liked what I had written to that point however, if asked for an overall plot outline at the stage, I would have been at a loss as I didn't know myself. I then reviewed what I had written, formed it into logical lineal chapters and created an outline to work to during Nanowrimo 2012, when I completed the first draft of the story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kyla (aka Lucy, aka Rain), is on the run after a terrorist (or freedom-fighter) attack on her life. She's changed her look and her name again (now she wants to be known as Riley) as she makes her way back to her mother, the same woman who ended up in the hands of antigovernment activists. Riley thinks she'll finally get some answers. A trip to her childhood home helps recover more of the memories that had been Slated away. Riley starts asking more questions about her birth, how she ended up in dangerous company, and why she was placed in the home of a high-ranking government official after Slating. The story is gripping and suspenseful, and the final revelations are a bit deus ex machina but rewarding nonetheless. Readers who have enjoyed the first two installments will not be disappointed by the dramatic conclusion.—Kyle Lukoff, Corlears School, New York City", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Behind the computing devices and applications that have transformed our lives are clever algorithms, and for every worthwhile algorithm there is a problem that it solves and a proof that it works. Before this proof there was an open problem: can one create an efficient algorithm to solve the computational problem? And, finally, behind these questions are the people who are excited about these fundamental issues in our computational world.In this book the authors draw on their outstanding research and teaching experience to showcase some key people and ideas in the domain of theoretical computer science, particularly in computational complexity and algorithms, and related mathematical topics. They show evidence of the considerable scholarship that supports this young field, and they balance an impressive breadth of topics with the depth necessary to reveal the power and the relevance of the work described.Beyond this, the authors discuss the sustained effort of their community, revealing much about the culture of their field. A career in theoretical computer science at the top level is a vocation: the work is hard, and in addition to the obvious requirements such as intellect and training, the vignettes in this book demonstrate the importance of human factors such as personality, instinct, creativity, ambition, tenacity, and luck.The authors' style is characterized by personal observations, enthusiasm, and humor, and this book will be a source of inspiration and guidance for graduate students and researchers engaged with or planning careers in theoretical computer science.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His main musical interest lie in the theory of music and how things are arranged. When taking his own guitar lessons, Bryan couldn't get many of the answers, as a student, that he was looking for. He always wanted to know why he was playing something, rather than knowing how to play it. The mechanics are the easy parts. It's knowing where to use it, and use it correctly that's the secret. Interestingly enough, Bryan's college interests were not in music, but in chemistry. Even after working in interesting positions, i.e., environmental oversight for a chemical weapons demilitarization facility, his heart was still in music theory. The intent of his book, \"A Guitarist's Guide to Theory\", was initially to be used as a teaching tool, as a student reference book, and as an aid for other aspiring teachers. Bryan wanted to put his teaching ideas and learning tools in the hands of others. After giving copies away for free for three years, he decided to make it available to others, for the edification of the musical arts. Bryan is dedicated to teaching music and helping others learn that there is much more to playing the guitar than an A minor pentatonic scale. His future writing plans are to take many of the chapters of this book expand them into individual books, with greater detail. Thanks, for your time... Keep asking questions... and God bless!!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has earned its\n 5 stars and a thank you from a big brother ;)- Randy MorrisonGreen informs us (with an incredibly comedic tone) something we all\nforget--the pitfalls and dangers of social media.  Social media can be\ngreat, but in many ways it's counterintuitive.  We're becoming less\nsocial.  I was glad to see Green covered a lot of the physically\ndamaging effects as well, such as weight and autoimmune diseases.\nInterestingly, social media not only eats time but also money.  When you\n read this, you'll get a new perspective and might will hopefully make\nsome changes in your life and habits.  Green has some interesting\ncommentary on our changing notions of privacy also.- Trease BaneSometimes I really think that I'm addicted to the web and I`m sure many\npeople are even though they don't realize this.

His hobby grew from a way to enjoy his pets and remember their antics to a vast portfolio available online through several different stock photography websites.  A simple Google Image search for \"Dog and cat\" reveals how far and wide his pictures have been used, with easily half a dozen appearing in the first page of results.  He has also always enjoyed many other artistic pursuits, from drawing illustrations and logos to complex three dimensional computer graphics.  With the birth of his daughter, Michael's hobby naturally evolved to include her, and he became interested in creating a children's book featuring his animal friends.  See Michael's other projects at his personal website (michaelpettigrew.com) or his company website (websubstance.com). Lindsay Wagner became part of our team in 2013. She loves Skippy, Qtip, and Moka and jumps right in to any project they are a part of. One of her favorite parts of the day is being greeted by them when she arrives at the Animal Wish headquarters in the morning. Her feet getting stepped on and their wagging tails always put a smile on her face. Lindsay’s goal is to translate the fun personalities she sees in the pets into Michael’s books for kids of all ages to enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": 4218140, "title": "The Adventures of Skippy, Qtip, and Moka", "author": "Michael Pettigrew", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
