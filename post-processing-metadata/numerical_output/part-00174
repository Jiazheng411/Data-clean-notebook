He published his first essentially autobiographical novel The Man from the North in 1898. His best work is contained in his novels of the 'Five Towns' which include Anna of the Five Towns (1902), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Clayhanger (1910), The Card (1911), Hilda Lessways (1911) and These Twain (1916).

Though she is determined to gain the weight for the health of her babies--even if it means she'll \"weigh more than a Honda\"--she can only express her deep fear by telling her doctor simply, \"I used to be fat.\"Klein was an eighth grader with a weight problem. It was a problem at school, where the boys called her \"Moose,\" and it was a problem at home, where her father reminded her, \"No one likes fat girls.\" After many frustrating sessions with a nutritionist known as the fat doctor of Roslyn Heights, Long Island, Klein's parents enrolled her for a summer at fat camp. Determined to return to school thin and popular, without her \"lard arms\" and \"puckered ham,\" Stephanie embarked on a memorable journey that would shape more than just her body. It would shape her life.In the ever-shifting terrain between fat and thin, adulthood and childhood, cellulite and starvation, Klein shares the cutting details of what it truly feels like to be an overweight child, from the stinging taunts of classmates, to the off-color remarks of her own father, to her thin mother's compulsive dissatisfaction with her own body. Calling upon her childhood diary entries, Klein reveals her deepest thoughts and feelings from that turbulent, hopeful time, baring her soul and making her heartache palpable.Whether Klein is describing her life as a chubby adolescent camper--getting weighed on a meat scale, petting past curfew, and \"chunky dunking\" in the lake--or what it's like now as a fit mother, having one-sided conversations with her newborn twins about the therapy they'll one day need, this hilarious yet grippingly vulnerable book will remind you what it was like to feel like an outsider, to desperately seek the right outfit, the right slang, the best comeback, or whatever that unattainable something was that would finally make you fit in.Marie Claire, forStraight Up and Dirty\"Stephanie Klein’s raw account of divorce at age 29 is refreshingly honest and funny, without delving into cheesy chick-lit territory.

After finding the ring, he has a record-breaking day. Are things going his way now? He decides the ring is his talisman and buys a gold chain on which to wear it. Knowing that there is no such thing as a free ride, this reviewer presumes that things will eventually go horribly awry. The idea is good and the plot does pull one in - the prose and style are a bit stilted, however and could do with the pace being tightened up a little. Overall, however, this reviewer feels this is a good, solid story and would be interested in reading more. --Amazon Top ReviewerAlong New York's Long Island shoreline, 44-year-old Billy Plunkett is trying to scrape by on a quiet living selling clams. He's got his boat, a smart-talking conscious he calls \"Harvey\" providing him with honest feedback, his loyal Labrador, Sweeney, and a passion for sculpting. Facing a dearth in clamming, Billy who has a BA in English but never wanted a 9-5 job, is concerned about how he's going to survive the future with sea pollution and his aching back. To pay his rent, he's had to borrow money from his sister Eileen whose husband thinks he should just get a real job. But for Billy \"the water was in his blood\" and making a living from things that are set in quantity and price, like the clam business, is what he prefers. Things begin to go well for Billy outside of the clam business when he meets two society ladies in town of Huntington who consider Billy attractive but beneath them. Erin, 36, a writer and media personality who calls him \"Sweetie,\" wines and dines Billy for sex and makes him a financial offer to allow her to take nude photographs of him for a coffee table book she's working on. And when Billy gets media attention and his cherished sculpture entitled The Jynx gets a $15,000 or higher offer, he has to navigate within the nebulous waters of money-making manipulators he's not used to. Though the story line feels passé, like Hemingway mixing with McInerney, this debut novel's prose is clean and very earnest. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organization", "related": ["B00B1I51H2"], "rank": 28374, "title": "THE JYNX", "author": "Kenneth C.

Drawing from her own feeling that she was, at times \"doing it wrong, \" Littauer has developed a personality test and four \"types\" for identification, so that Christians can find their fit in spiritual practices. She uses Hippocrates' four basic chemical types; there's the \"Popular Sanguine,\" the \"Powerful Choleric,\" the \"Perfect Melancholy\" and the \"Peaceful Phlegmatic.\" Much like other typologies popular in church circles—Myers-Briggs and the Enneagram—all Littauer's types feature strengths and weaknesses. She also \"types\" Jesus, who, not surprisingly, is the perfect balance of all four categories. This book will be helpful for evangelical Christians who feel out of sync with the usual devotional practices being promoted in their churches. It will hold little interest for those Christians who already accept that there are many paths to a deeper relationship with God and need no new typologies to persuade them.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author creates a whole new world with different classes of people and rituals. Yet with the style of writing the author makes everything so real, the reader has no problem imagining the world that has been created on the page. A lot of times in fantasy or Sci-Fi stories I tend to get lost at the beginning of the book, trying to figure out what's what and who's who in the author's world. It usually takes me a few chapters to familiarize myself with the new world and its people. I didn't have a problem at all following this author or keeping up with his imagination. Aulic is an interesting lead character and his life in Prension is intriguing. The author sets the stage for a wonderful novel sure to entertain and delight. In a few short pages I was deeply invested in the characters and story. The story flows smoothly and this is a book I would definitely buy. --Amazon Top ReviewerSet in a time that could be the bleak distant future, or past, in a land that could be anywhere, this over-long epic reads like an elaborate put-on, and if a theme is to be discerned it might be a denunciation of male bonding rituals that launch a boy from child to adult. A sampling of the prose: \"The very air was redolent of sourness, as though a dark lemon wind blew across the land.\" Aulic is a young man, resented by his short brother, Bodin, who would rather read books and suck on \"lebel nuts' than fish or play manly games of might and intellect. It must be noted that lebel nuts, when chewed, have \"a subtle mind-softening quality\". \"The stone pictures lightly vibrated in his nut-altered vision.\" The unbearably jealous Bodin concocts a plan to send Aulic as a diplomatic emissary to the Frissen people, and in a kind of wag-the-dog scheme, Bodin causes the villagers, by means of an extensive campaign, to suddenly despise these people who live some distance away and who are \"clad in vegetal attire\". Aulic proceeds forth. It's possible that very lonely boys might find this execrable epic to have merit.

Juan Rodrigo sets out to dig one last grave, that of his only child, teenage Esperanza. Sitting down with Esperanza's ghost, Juan recounts a life of work and fatherhood, interrupted by tales of his deceased charges. Many of these tales teach lessons like forgiveness, as in \"The Story of Sofia and César,\" about the town crone who betrayed her husband and only learned in death to forgive him for refusing to take her back. Others are personal, like the story of Juan's wife, Carlota, who died after giving birth, concerning her unhappy first marriage to a man whose war injury prevented him from consummating. Most poignant is Esperanza's own tale of growing up motherless, her only companions a horse named Bella and a Gypsy boy, Antonio, whom she grows to love. All Juan's tales pertain to the slippery notion of truth—when Juan claims, \"I can only tell stories that have truth,\" Esperanza asks him, \"[H]ow do you know thatyourstory is the true one?\"—which lends some weight to his words, but too often Juan indulges in sentiment and nostalgia. The Old World charm of Grandbois's novel tickles, but fails to captivate.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Geographically, she ranges from the Arctic to South America. She is versed in the narratives of exploration, colonization, and European science.Subject Matterengages the material world and the cultural world and stresses complex and mutual influences. It is a cultural history, but the book is also much more. Read as an environmental history, the book is the most sophisticated demonstration of the centrality of gender to analysis of nature and the environment that I have yet seen. It is a book that I will be thinking about and recommending to others for quite some time. (Richard White, Stanford University)In this wide-ranging and highly suggestive book, Joyce E. Chaplin, makes a stimulating contribution to scholarship on the origins of American ideas of racial difference.Subject Matter, compliments current work in several ways...Where most scholars, like Winthrop Jordan in his path-breakingWhite over Black, have focused mainly on Anglo-American ideas of African racial difference, here the author is primarily concerned with Anglo-American ideas of Amerindian difference...The significance of the book and the author's appointment cannot be underestimated. She has become the Perry Miller of academia's next generation, replacing his 'New England Mind' with her 'Anglo-American Body'...Like Mr. Miller'sThe New England Mind,Subject Matteris an impressively thought-provoking achievement destined to serve as a touchstone of debate for some time to come. The author's style is measured, her concerns moral, and her scholarship daring. (Evan HaefeliWashington Times2001-06-10)With this sweeping reinterpretation of early cultural encounters between the English and American natives, Joyce E. Chaplin thoroughly alters our historical view of the origins of English presumptions of racial superiority, and of the role science and technology played in shaping these notions. (techdirections2001-12-01)This book does well what few books manage to accomplish even crudely--taking a historical context that at first seems familiar and showing new and interesting complications, contradictions, and still-pending questions. It also develops a number of subthemes in unexpected but convincing ways, providing a truly fresh perspective. Among the several strands that Chaplin artfully interweaves are race, weaponry, adaptation, the physical environment, the nature of science, English ideas about the human body, dissimilarities with the Spanish national character, and a host of other themes...[This book] provides rich rewards and fascinating serendipity.

After a year at the University of Bern, Switzerland, Jim became the first teaching assistant in the English department at Boston College. With an M.A. almost in hand, he did a stint as an artillery officer at Fort Benning, GA, returned to New York to marry the love of his life, got a job teaching English in Brooklyn, and began to take courses at NYU. After research in Germany and (finally!) finishing his Ph.D. , Jim found a home at Eastern Connecticut State College. At Eastern he created an American studies program, chaired the English department, and directed the honors program for ten years. A sometime science fiction nut, Jim is guilty of having published a novelette, \"Witch Children,\" in GALAXY, one of those garishly illustrated pulp magazines that flourished in the heyday of hard-core science fiction. After retiring from Eastern, he wrote DOUBLE TROUBLE just for fun.  Jim and Barbara Lacey celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in August, 2008.

Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time.

An introductory chapter contains some very basic quantum mechanical background. The second chapter contains derivations of basic notions of classical statistical mechanics, together with a discussion of general laws of macroscopic thermodynamics. The third chapter addresses various applications to physically interesting cases of ideal and non-ideal gases. In the last chapter, a discussion of basic concepts of quantum statistical physics (quantum gases) is followed by a brief discussion of relativistic phenomena.\"--Zentralblatt Math 1225-1\"This book is an excellent introduction to statistical thermodynamics, which covers the fundamental physical concepts used for the macroscopic description of systems with very large number of particles in thermo-dynamic equilibrium. Also the macroscopic concepts used in this book, are shown to be connected to the appropriate microscopic theories. However, in the literature, statistical thermodynamics is frequently introduced purely from macroscopic point of view. But in general the macroscopic description is largely independent on the details of the microscopic models describing the interactions of the particle in various physical systems. So learning the connection between microscopic and macroscopic concept will definitely enhance the understanding of the subject to great extent.I recommend this book as one of the most lucidly written introductory texts on Statistical Thermodynamics.\"--Contemporary Physics", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wills describes brilliantly the manner in which this strange work seeped slowly through literary circles. . . . His book is a passionate plea that we should read Augustine's strange book as it was first heard, and in the light of the purposes for which it was first written.\"--Peter Brown,New York Review of Books\"Wills does for Augustine'sConfessionswhat he did for the Gettysburg Address, which is to take a well-known iconic work and examine it with fresh eyes. He views theConfessionsas a book haunted by Genesis, and this perspective allows him to notice things that are overlooked by commentators whose views are preformed by the interpretive tradition. Having translated theConfessionsand written a biography of Augustine, Wills is not afraid to go out on a limb, and so even readers who would not agree with his often cheeky interpretations are forced to look at the work afresh. . . . Wills offers an iconoclastic interpretation of a classic work, one that deserves a fresh treatment every few years.\"--Augustine J. Curley,Library Journal\"Like a biography of a person, this volume takes Augustine'sConfessionsand traces its birth, growth and decline, and legacy. Since so much of an author's life is connected to his or her work--especially in the case ofConfessions--this can't help but include a decent amount of Augustine's own bio. . . . Very readable and highly engaging.\"--Wade Osburn,Booklist\"[Augustine] and Wills, 76--one of the most distinguished Catholic intellectuals (and American historians) alive--make a potent pair in this lovely little volume, a biography not of the author, but of the book itself, especially of how it has been received in the 16 centuries since its creation. . . . Augustine is always going to matter to the Western tradition, atheist or religious, for his insights into the human psyche, and his thoughts on memory and the elusiveness of time. Wills, by stripping away centuries of myth-making, makes him more accessible than ever.\"--Brian Bethune,Macleans\"This is the type of biography you normally don't see. It is not a biography of Augustine, there are enough of those; it is not another translation of his Confessions, there are enough of those as well. What this is, and what it attempts to be, is a biography ofAugustine's Confessions.\"--Kevin Winter,Portland Book Review\"Garry Wills really is a modern-day Renaissance man. He won a Pulitzer Prize forLincoln at Gettysburgand then turned his attention to St Augustine, firstly translatingConfessions, then writing a biography (St Augustine: A Life) and now offering a 'life' of Confessions from 'The Book's Birth' (the title of the opening chapter) through 'The Book's Conversion' to 'The Book's Baptismal Days' to 'The Book's Afterlife'. And what a story it is.\"--Bruce Elder,Sydney Morning Herald\"This is a short, reliable and well-written introduction to Augustine'sConfessionsthat describes, firstly, how theConfessionscame to be written and, secondly, the author's intentions in writing theConfessionsthese are not quite the same and, thirdly, the subsequent fate of the book. . . . With a deft touch, and in non-technical language, Wills' introductory book not only relays these ideas to the widest possible readership--but also communicates a sensitive understanding of the original context in which theConfessionswere written and of Augustine's intentions in writing them.\"--Stephen Leach,Metapsychology\"Garry Wills . . . writes about Augustine's Confessions sympathetically but rigorously. He traces its trajectory from first appearance at the end of the 4th century AD until our time, and discusses the ideas contained within it. The result is readable and illuminating, and it sent this reader to Google and Amazon in search of more.\"--Miriam Cosic,The Australian\"Garry Wills has written a short book that teaches us how to read a longer book. If we follow Wills' instructions we will discover new riches in St. Augustine's seminal classic,The Confessions. . . . This is a very helpful guide to theConfessionsthat makes the great spiritual classic accessible to a new generation of readers. Wills' book is not only scholarly, but it makes good spiritual reading. It is highly recommended, not just for the regular reader, but for students of Augustine looking for a fresh take on this great book.\"--Fr. Gilles Mongeau S.J.,Catholic Register\"The single most important thing for Wills, the thing he'd most like you to accept, is thatConfessionsis not autobiography. For Wills, this misreading of Augustine's best-known work has given us any number of interpretations (Freudian, sociological, historical) that obscure the point. And that point is? According to Wills,Confessionsexist as a kind of 'training ground' or preparation for a reading of the Bible. He shows us how Augustine uses incidents from his life (some actual, some allegorical, some difficult to place on either side of the ledger) to turn the reader's mind toward holy writ, specifically Genesis. In other words, to prepare us to see/read/feel God's presence as it is revealed in Genesis. . . . His arguments make for vivid reading.\"--André Alexis,Globe and Mail\"I have taught the Confessions about twenty times, yet there are things in it I hadn't noticed until Wills pointed them out. This is a tribute to his erudition and critical acumen, but it's also a tribute to the Confessions itself, which, like any other classic, offers the reader an inexhaustible surplus of meaning.\"--Lawrence S Cunningham,Commonweal\"[A] brief, beautifully written story of the Confessions themselves. . . . [Wills] is a prolific writer who has tackled an extraordinary range of topics. . . . Wills clearly loves his subject . . . and that admiration is tied to a clear-headed examination of the many ways Augustine's critics have gone astray over time.\"--Jean Bethke Elshtain,American Conservative\"This is a masterful introductory work, written by someone of real eloquence and theological sensitivity. It is worth every minute spent on a first reading, and I have no doubt I will go back to the underlined passages each time I rereadConfessionsin the future.\"--Kim Paffenroth,Biography", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age of two he was adopted by a canal boatman and his wife. He was brought up on the vast Kingstanding Council estate. He began work as a butcher's boy and for the next nine years had a succession of short-lived jobs, ranging from building site labourer, window cleaner, soft drinks delivery man, power-press operator to door-to-door salesman. A serious motorcycle accident led him to train as a teacher of maladjusted children. He went on to gain the degrees of BA., M.Sc., and PhD., mostly by part-time study. He became a Research and Chartered Psychologist, and an Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society. He was principal lecturer for post-graduate awards and Head of Special Needs and Habilitation for ten years in what is now the University of Winchester. He has numerous academic and research based publications, many focused upon behavioural and emotional difficulties. His Teacher Information Pack (Tips), published by Macmillan Education, which embraced the whole range of Special Educational Needs, was described in a psychological Journal review as an Opus Magnum. He was the originator, author and co-developer of the Baby Progress Guides, a pack of materials designed to help parents assess their baby's development. He also had his own regular column, The Dawson File, in Special Children magazine. The Last Viking is his first novel. His next novel I, Oedipus, is underway and is told from the psychological perspective of a serial rapist and killer who is obsessed by the Oedipus myth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Of course,mansionwas a better word for the ten-thousand-square-foot, three-story monstrosity that rose up out of the bayou, its dark windows peeking out from moss-covered stone and seeming to stare back at her.It was at least eighty degrees in Cypriere, Louisiana, but Justine felt a chill come over her, and she crossed her arms in front of her chest, trying to cast off the feeling of foreboding. laMalediction, the locals called it—meaning \"the curse.\" Both beautiful and horrifying, seductive and sinister, it seemed to call to her.And that gave her the creeps.She chided herself for being fanciful and reached back into her car to grab her small suitcase. Just because her mother chose to believe in haunts and curses didn't mean Justine followed suit. The house was a house. Granted, this house was an extremely large one—with a bloody history—but that didn't change the job she had to do. In fact, it made her job all the more interesting.\"You made it.\" A voice called from the entry to the house, and Justine looked up and waved at Olivia Mark-ham, the woman who'd hired her for the research job at la Malediction. Olivia smiled and crossed the courtyard to Justine's car.\"I'm glad to see you,\" Olivia said. \"I was starting to worry you wouldn't make it here by dark. We've made some strides clearing the road to the house, but it's still not the best place to be at night if you don't know where you're going.\"Justine smiled, thinking \"road\" was a bit of a stretch to call the dirt path almost hidden by the swamp. \"Sorry I worried you. I got held up by my mother. She's a professional at making me late.\"Olivia opened the door to the backseat and pulled out one of Justine's boxes of supplies. \"I hope she's not worried about you staying here,\" Olivia said, as they walked toward the house.Justine frowned. \"She's not thrilled, but my mother is not your average person.\"Olivia balanced the box on her hip and opened the front door to the house so Justine could walk inside. \"What do you mean?\" Olivia asked. \"Is there such a thing as an average mother?\"\"Probably not, but mine is worse than most. She was raised deep in the bayou and still believes in the old ways.\"Olivia closed the door and stared at her. \"Voodoo?\"\"Yeah,\" Justine said and stared beyond Olivia at the wall behind her. Her mother's insistence on using spells and potions to manage every aspect of her life and health, along with her attempts to direct Justine the same way, had resulted in years of constant friction between them.\"Wow,\" Olivia said and started down a hallway. \"You never told me that when we talked before.\"\"It's not something I like to tell a lot of people.\"Olivia gave her a sympathetic look. \"I understand, but iven the situation here, your secondhand knowledge of voodoo may help you with your research.\"Justine stared at Olivia. \"You don't believe in that stuff, do you?\"\"I believe there are more things unexplained than explained here at laMalediction. And I believe the former residents believed in it. Understanding those beliefs may help you find the missing emeralds.\"\"And fulfill a voodoo prophecy, right?\"Olivia shrugged. \"That's what the journals say. I figured a historian like you would love to solve an old mystery with a treasure at the end.\"\"Yes,\" Justine agreed, although her reasons for taking the job involved so much more than locating the allegedly cursed emeralds that Olivia referred to. So much more that Justine hadn't told Olivia or anyone else, and didn't intend to. If Olivia knew the real reason Justine had jumped at the chance to access the old journals and photo albums at laMalediction, she may have thought twice about hiring her.Olivia stepped into a library and set the box she was carrying down on a table in the center of the room. \"I figured you'd want to set up shop here in the library. I moved all the books from the underground chamber up here.\"Justine looked around the library, at the wall-to-wall bookcases teeming with old books, and could hardly contain her desire to get started. \"It's perfect.\" She pulled a book from one of the shelves and opened it, immediately drawn to the beautiful longhand text inside. \"You said you brought everything up from the tunnels? Do you think you and John found everything…all the passageways?\"Olivia frowned. \"We hope so. But I don't want to lie to you—we really don't know. I… Damn, there's somethingI need to tell you, and I'll understand if you change your mind about staying.\"Justine studied Olivia, wondering what had made the calm and collected woman she'd met in New Orleans so nervous. \"What's wrong?\"Olivia took a deep breath and blew it out. \"When I stayed here before…when all those things happened to me, John and I assumed it was the estate attorney, Ross Wheeler, who was responsible for everything.\"Justine nodded. Wheeler had been killed by Olivia's fiancé, John, while holding Olivia hostage in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the missing emeralds. He'd used the secret passages in the house to spy on her and play tricks with her mind.\"The thing is, the day someone locked me in a tunnel, Wheeler was in court in New Orleans. We just found out a couple of days ago. It couldn't have been him.\"Justine took a couple of seconds to process that information. \"So someone else was sneaking around besides Wheeler?\"Olivia bit her lower lip. \"Yeah, and we don't know who, as there's no indication from Wheeler's documents that he was working with anyone. But the reality is, if that one incident wasn't Wheeler, then some of the others, like the night someone shot at John, may not have been him, either.\"\"And with Wheeler dead, you can't ask.\"\"Exactly. John and I talked it over with the new estate attorney and none of us want you or anyone else to be at the house alone. We also don't think it's safe for anyone to stay here at night. You're at a complete disadvantage against anyone who knows the estate, and with the storms that move in, you can become trapped in a matter of minutes. So the estate attorney found a vacant house in town to rent…and John and I sorta convinced the attorney to hire a bodyguard.\"\"You what?\" Surely, she hadn't heard correctly.\"The rental house is right behind Main Street and has two bedrooms. Unfortunately, the owner is out of town until tomorrow, so you can't get the keys until then. The commute isn't bad, as long as it's not raining, and this way you both have a safe place to stay, hopefully where the electricity works better.\"Justine frowned. Staying in a rental away from the estate wasn't optimum, but she could hardly blame the estate attorney for being careful. He probably didn't want the liability. Then Olivia's exact wording hit her.\"Bothof us? This bodyguard is staying in the rental house with me?\"\"His name is Brian and he's a longtime friend of John's,\" Olivia rushed to explain. \"He's an ex-Marine and works at the New Orleans police department with John. He's overdue for vacation and offered to do this to help us out. I promise you he's completely trustworthy and qualified to protect you. You'll be here at laMalediction during the day and only at the rental at night. Even in closer quarters, I promise Brian won't get in your way.\"Despite the ten-thousand-square feet of laMalediction and the unknown amount of acreage to get lost in, the thought of some strange man roaming the halls while she worked bothered Justine on a number of levels. And that was daytime. She couldn't even comprehend staying in close quarters every night with a strange man. Especially a cop. Justine's family didn't have the best of relationships with law enforcement, and she'd grown a bit jaded about the whole \"protect and serve\" claims they made.\"I don't know…\" Justine said, not sure how to argue with what appeared to be a reasonable plan, given the circumstances.\"If you're not comfortable with him, then we'll get someone else. But we can't let you work here alone. I'd feel guilty forever if something happened to you, and, well, the attorney sorta insisted.\"Justine sighed. \"I understand. It's not that I blame you for being concerned, and I certainly understand the attorney's position. It's just that I have…well, reclusive tendencies.\"Olivia placed a hand on her arm and gave her a sympathetic look. \"I totally get that, and I'm really sorry that this turned out to be different than what you signed up for. But I hope you'll still take the job. I have a good feeling about you.\"Justine smiled. \"I'm not going to let a man keep me from this job. It's by far the most intriguing thing I've ever been asked to research. I'm looking forward to it.\"The relief on Olivia's face was obvious. \"I promise Brian will blend into the background and will not be around unless needed. The attorney scheduled appointments with appraisers and contractors to provide bids for the repairs needed. The old caretaker was only able to minimally maintain the estate, and the house needs a lot of work before it can be sold. Brian will escort those people to do their job while he's here.\"The sound of crunching gravel sounded outside the library window and Justine looked out to see a Jeep pull into the courtyard.\"That's him,\" Olivia said. \"I'll go get him so I ca...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 44.0}

This second book is to provide a general overview and picture of where we are heading and why in our work with this ancient art. Sometimes we all need to go back to the basics to remind ourselves why we do the thing we do. This is the aim of this second volume.The 3rd book:Ways of Learning- is aimed at the more practised student and leaner of the martial arts. It is the culmination of the 3 books and focuses on how, as learners and teachers of these noble arts, we can take that next step to turning our art into something revolutionary in our lives.

Batman andStar Warsfanatics roam the streets in costume, D&D; gamers spend hours in huddles, and die-hard fans of certain movies, comics, and books revel in fandom. Douglas Wolk, a journalist and critic who writes on comic books, expresses it this way: \"Comic-Con is a bacchanalian 100-hour orgy of fandom, and fandom is all about cathexis: investing one's energy and identity in a particular idea or person or thing.\" In this Kindle Single, Wolk explores both the culture of enthusiasts and the big business of extending a comic book into a novel, and then into a movie, and then into merchandise, and then into a massive branded franchise with an endless array of things for fans to buy. Wolk expertly guides readers through the alien terrain of the convention floor and back-room industry discussions. His writing is fluid and elegant, his observations are acute, and his explanations of what drives both the enthusiast and business end of this subculture will lead readers to one \"aha\" moment after another. If Yoda were a writer, he might be Douglas Wolk, initiating readers in the Force that drives American entertainment. Highly, highly recommended for Comic-Con fans, and for people like me, who have never understood Comic-Con, its devotees, and people who wrap their identities in fictional others. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 1002945, "title": "Comic-Con Strikes Again!

Parrish, Barbara Parker, Janet Evanovich, J.A.\n\t\t\t\tJance --- the list goes on, and I have all of them on my shelves\n\t\t\t\t(and as I discover more series characters, more and more are\n\t\t\t\tgoing onto my e-reader as well, because there's only so much\n\t\t\t\troom in the house, and only so many trees I'm willing to feel\n\t\t\t\tguilty about killing).In romance, though, 'series' tend to be\n\t\t\t\tspin-offs rather than series.  There might be hints and\n\t\t\t\treferences to what happened before, but the major players in\n\t\t\t\tbook 2 were probably secondary characters in book 1.  Allison\n\t\t\t\tBrennan, Karen Rose, Catherine Coulter's FBI series, Roxanne St.\n\t\t\t\tClaire's \"Bullet Catchers\" - they're all stand alone books that\n\t\t\t\thave roots elsewhere. Suzanne Brockmann's \"Troubleshooters\"\n\t\t\t\tbooks seem to straddle both categories.When I wroteFinding Sarah, I\n\t\t\t\thadn't envisioned it as a series of any sort.  However, when I\n\t\t\t\tfinished, one of the secondary characters, Colleen McDonald,\n\t\t\t\twanted her own story, which ended up beingStarting Over.\n\t\t\t\tI picked her up and moved her across the country, with only the\n\t\t\t\tvaguest references to what had happened before she left Pine\n\t\t\t\tHills--and her trigger for moving was not part ofFinding\n\t\t\t\tSarahat all.  Also, I wasn't sure I'd be able to sellFinding Sarah, and I didn't need a book 2 if there was no book\n\t\t\t\t1.Randy and Sarah insisted they weren't done\n\t\t\t\tyet.  Another dilemma. Hidden Firewas going to be\n\t\t\t\tanother romantic suspense, but my hero and heroine already knew\n\t\t\t\teach other and were already in the typical HEA required by the\n\t\t\t\tgenre.  How to begin?  I put the two of them together and let\n\t\t\t\tthem go. To maintain the conflict and tension of the\n\t\t\t\trelationship, I fast-forwarded a few months, and pulled Randy\n\t\t\t\tout of the scenario letting Sarah re-evaluate the relationship.\n\t\t\t\tAfter all, she'd spent most ofFinding Sarahwanting to be\n\t\t\t\tindependent.  Second thoughts, anyone?But the fun in the writing was in being\n\t\t\t\table to start the book with something steamier than a typical\n\t\t\t\tcontemporary romance, since they were already in a relationship. And, I got to send them down to Eureka and Arcata, where we'd\n\t\t\t\tvacationed, adding to the setting and letting me use some of the\n\t\t\t\tlocal scenery.", "related": [], "rank": 471781, "title": "Hidden Fire (Pine Hills Police Book 2)", "author": "Terry Odell", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.2857, "rating_total": 30.0}

Then his younger brother discovers a mysterious red mark on the wall of an alley and worries that it is blood. While they are investigating the alley, the brothers come across another stray but this one won't let Larry get close to it. Meanwhile, he discovers that the price of dog food has gone up and worries about having enough money to feed the animals in his care. By solving the mystery in the alley, Larry is able to find a way to feed the animals and also figures out how to approach the stray and take it home. The suspense in this easy-to-read chapter book will carry readers through to the end. The relationship between the brothers is warmly depicted, as Larry looks out for and spends time with Paul.

Since then, I've written two full novels and most of a third. I've also learned a lot about writing and self publishing.One thing I've learned is that reviews are the bread and butter for every indie author. It's reviews that initiate the spread of recognition that brings new readers to the books. Additionally, I've discovered that short story anthologies don't get a lot or any reviews. Not sure why that is, but I imagine it has something to do with the fact that with 5 to 10 stories in the book, there are going to be some that a reader doesn't care for, along with those s/he loves. So writing a review is not easy. Plus, they're time consuming and who has time? Still, I'd like to ask you to please write a few words about \"Lovably Dead\".  They don't have to be a lot of words and finding those words shouldn't require much of your time. Finally, it you liked my writing style and are interested in metaphysical science fiction, paranormal stories or religious conspiracy thrillers, please check out my novels - \"No Heaven\" (published), \"No Hell\" (published), and \"No Religion\" (coming soon).

In this case we began with Daniel. I also decided that we should begin by asking about the book's circumstances of composition, literary genre, literary structure, and thematic development.  Shortly afterwards I came for the first time upon Mortimer Adler's marvelous volumeHow to Read a Book. He said we should always begin by looking for the answers to those same questions, which he put this way: When and why was this book written? What kind of writing is it? How is it put together, on its own terms? And what are the main ideas that run all through it? This was marvelous confirmation of the approach I wanted to take and it became the grid through which I approached all biblical books from then on.Fast forward several years to when I was a member of the design group that was helping the International Bible Society (now Biblica) develop a new format that would eventually becomeThe Books of the Bible. I was asked to write the first drafts of the book and section introductions. Instinctively I crafted each one with the four key questions in mind.Space limitations did not permit the full introductions to be included inThe Books of the Bible. But Biblica thought it would be valuable to make them available in a separate volume, and I'm grateful to them for doing this, for the sake of those who want even more depth and detail. InterVarsity Press has now picked up this volume and I hope it helps answer many questions, and raise others for further exploration, for those who will be reading the Bible the same way they would, well, read a book.", "related": [], "rank": 2245361, "title": "Read the Bible Smarter, Not Harder: Exploring the Stories Behind the Books", "author": "Christopher R.

An amateur history buff, he went on to a career in pulp magazines and screenplays, often using a Southern California backdrop for his stories.   Aside from Zorro, McCulley created many other pulp characters, including Black Star, The Spider, The Mongoose, and Thubway Tham.

In my original draft of this story, I had Arturo be of Mayan descent.\nIt seemed reasonable to switch that to Aztec (a culture that came after the\nMayan culture, which collapsed around 900 A.D.), and there are many lines of\nsuggestion (if little evidence) that the Aztec trace their original homeland of\nAztlan, which many lines of evidence trace to the Anasazi in northwestern New\nMexico.

Moving from the later 1940s to the post-9/11 era, this book effectively links civil defense to larger issues of U.S. nuclear strategy and illuminates how seemingly marginal oppositional movements can cumulatively influence the course of events.  While documenting the more absurd aspects of civil defense propaganda, Garrison does not settle for easy ridicule but approaches the topic with the moral seriousness it deserves.\"--Paul Boyer, author ofBy the Bomb's Early Light: American Thought and Culture at the Dawn of the Atomic Age\"Garrison offers a superb introduction to the antinuclear movement....Bracing for Armageddon is an excellent book on a topic only increasing in relevance.\"--Andrew J. Falk, Register of the Kentucky Historical Society\"Those interested in the history of the Cold War, the anti-nuclear movement, and how the construction of the military-industrial complex impacted on the lives of ordinary Americans cannot afford to miss this volume.\"-- Wendy E. Chmielewski, Curator, Swarthmore College and past president of the Peace History Society\"Historian Dee Garrison's latest work turns the timely issue of civil defense on its head. This is a most relevant, enlightening, and sometimes scary read.\"--Harriet Hyman Alonso, author ofPeace as a Women's Issue\"Could not be more timely. Russia and the US still target each other with over 2500 hydrogen bombs on hair-trigger alert, and nuclear war, despite the absence of overt hostilities, could break out at any moment, obliterating much of the planet. Read this book and wake up!\"--Helen Caldicott MD\"A marvelous book, rich in detail and insight.  It reminds us not only of our rulers' bizarre preparations for nuclear war, but of the many courageous people who stood up and successfully resisted them.\"--Lawrence S.

The narrator is 15-year-old Welcome (she was named by her older sister, Evelyn Sue, who \"wanted me to always know that, even though I was number three, I was certainly welcome\"). Bright and unusually ambitious (she wants to be a pediatrician), she struggles with adolescent awkwardness, strict parents and her first heartbreak. On the rebound, she lets a boy she doesn't love have intercourse with her--just once--and she gets pregnant. Her family ships her off to her childless aunt and uncle, which gives Welcome a chance to ponder her future. The characters throughout are memorable; like Welcome, each uniquely combines ordinary vulnerability with unexpected stores of strength. For example, Evelyn Sue runs off to Hollywood in search of her beloved James Dean, but she returns with real wisdom and adult resolve. Mrs. Horn, neighbor to Welcome's aunt and uncle, survived WWII in a prisoner-of-war camp, feeding her infant twins on raw bird's eggs. The pacing is not always consistent; it's Welcome herself, not any inherent dramatic tension, that will hold readers. Ages 10-14.

His diaries are based on his personal experiences of running the Dirty White Boy clothes store with his partner Jorge Betancourt in Soho’s Old Compton Street.  Clayton captures a memorable moment in Soho’s history and his writing finds humour and affection for the prostitutes, street cleaners, transsexuals, bag ladies and shoplifters that he encountered on one the most colourful street corners in the world.  Reviews compared his first book to the diaries of Samuel Pepys, Virginia Woolf and Christopher Isherwood’s Berlin Stories. In 2009 it was named Gay Times Book of the Year and was endorsed by celebrities such as Sir Elton John, Stephen Fry, Holly Johnson and Sebastian Horsley.  In April 2009 Clayton turned the book into a play. It premiered at the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End and starred Clayton and the actor David Benson. It sold out. The play returned a year later for an extended run receiving reviews from, among others, Nicholas de Jongh and Paul Gambaccini.  Now Clayton’s written a sequel, Goodbye to Soho. www.claytonlittlewood.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That scares him more than anything he would face from the vampires. I thought this story was a very powerful look inside this man's heart.

If we wish to look afresh at this world, then we do not need anyone to tell us what to think, but rather show us how to think: Ways of Learning. 50 Questions and Answers is the second volumein the Tai Chi Trilogy -  and looks specifically at the basic questions we all have as learners of Tai Chi. This second book is to provide a general overview and picture of where we are heading and why with this ancient art. Sometimes we all need to go back to the basics to remind ourselves why we do the things we do. The Manual of Bean Curd Boxing is the 1st book in the Tai Chi Trilogy and is aimed at everyone who has a curiosity about how Tai Chi and Taoism can be applied to our everyday lives. The fundamental aim is to show how by learning to leave things be (to step back, observe and await the ideal moment) we can live a life more fuller and more spontaneous.

By tracking the unlikely, decades-long journey of an eccentric photographer's left-behind portraits, Julia Scully achieves something magical: not only does she bring small-town photographer Mike Disfarmer to life, but she also gives life to the rural Arkansans--farmers and soldiers, sweethearts and newlyweds, babies and grandparents--whose honest faces inhabit those once abandoned negatives. When Disfarmer died in 1959, his negatives were sold for $5, then were left moldering in a carport until a newspaper photographer discovered them in the 1970s. As editor ofModern Photographymagazine at the time, Scully played a key role in championing the intimate beauty of Disfarmer's work, which captured both the poverty and stoic resilience of his subjects, most of them residents of Heber Springs, Arkansas. (See for yourself at disfarmer.com.) Scully helped publish a book about Disfarmer in 1976, which prompted comparisons to Diane Arbus and Richard Avedon. The New York Times called Disfarmer's work \"an outstanding discovery\" and he has since become the subject of books, films, and exhibitions, his black and white mini-masterpieces selling for thousands of dollars and hanging in New York City’s MOMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is a beautiful and a strangely hopeful story about the lasting power of a humble and reclusive photographer's rare gift.--Neal Thompson", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": 568069, "title": "Backwoods Genius (Kindle Single)", "author": "Julia Scully", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 54.0}

The disease was disabling from the beginning, and thus a catalyst for her search into what causes the disease.  The idea of spending a lifetime in a wheelchair, losing her mind with cognitive deficits, and more, was disturbing enough to make her proactive to manage, and conquer the disease.  The author went on to study human nutrition at the master's level, and received her degree in summer of 2003. She became a proponent of vitamin D3 immediately upon reading a book on its steroid properties in 1998.  She attended workshops at the NIH about vitamin D3 in fall 2003, and was invited by Harvard Medical School to do a poster presentation on her master's thesis at Harvard's graduate symposium in Boston, 2004.  The topic of her thesis was an epidemiological review of the cluster of MS in the area she grew up in, and the impact of childhood diet, and the environment.  The author had faith in her statistical results from her small study, and in the thesis she wrote, which she copyrighted.  For the next 9 years the author continued to read and research every piece of MS science that she came across. She continued to attend patient programs, and listen to many neurologists, hoping for new ideas of causation.  In the fall of 2011, the author had an epiphany, which brought the ideas of her thesis to be expanded upon in this book, because the triggers became specifically obvious to her attention.  The entire reason for her quest to find out the real cause of MS, was the progression of the disease and loss of friends too soon because of Multiple Sclerosis.  Also, the preservation, hopefully, of her children's lives from its often devastating consequences.  Robin had wanted to be a pediatrician from a young age, and hopes now, that she can serve today's children, and their futures.  As a child, she had a concern that pollution would impact the world negatively, and perhaps her child genius understood. The author lays out a foundation of association to what triggers MS, so the world of MS can move forward towards a better hope for the afflicted.", "related": [], "rank": 1445657, "title": "Clues to the Cause, Questions for a Cure: The Poisons Causing Multiple Sclerosis Worldwide", "author": "Robin Montesano", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If there is any hope of avoiding the twin threats of ecological disaster and economic collapse, this book describes a path forward.\" --Brian K.

I am submitting 21 poems with them this year, 2012 for 6 awards. I am also learning Vietnamese to help the Vietnamese in my community to find true happiness by studying the Bible and having a close relationship with our Creator. Even though my book was published in 2005, it has had limited marketing. I have sold a few and gave many as gifts to friends and family. After my mom's passing in 2007, I was left with an emptiness that resulted in over 5 years of no promotion. Now i am back in the swing of things, back on the bandwagon, so to speak. I am 36 years old and i have been through a lot that many would be afraid to tell, including a suicidal attempt in which i was badly scarred. I have a Facebook account so you can see pictures of me in my Vietnamese group. I am happy to be alive and to be doing well.

Unlocking the Ivory Tower is a valuable bridge between academic findings and the people who can most benefit from them. It delves into a variety of classical and recent works from the major academic fields and critically evaluates their relevance. (The annotated table of contents is an unexpected treat, too, providing an overview of a variety of important concepts.) Along the way, Ball and LiPuma also educate the reader about the evolution of each field, providing a rare—and fun—dose of intellectual history. –Noam Wasserman, Harvard Business School, author of The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a StartupIdeas truly make the world go round. Given this impact, business leaders need to be able to ground their decision-making with state-of-the-art insights. Eric Ball and Joe LiPuma make this eminently possible through their wide-ranging and thoughtful compendium of leading management research on topics such as finance, strategy, entrepreneurship, leadership, and innovation. Their work allows a business leader to harness the best the “ivory tower” has to offer to create real-world professional success. –Mark Zupan, Dean of the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of RochesterImagine the greatest business thinkers in the world, all combined in a single classroom. Eric Ball and Joe LiPuma have written a monumental work that surveys the world of cutting-edge management thinking and makes it easy to grasp. This is no ordinary business book: it is both a useful tool for practitioners and a powerful exploration of the workings of organizations, entrepreneurship, innovation, and finance. This book is like an MBA and Ph.D. in one, guided by the hand of two highly experienced experts. Unlocking the Ivory Tower is a gift to the world, and it is a strongly recommended read for executives, investors, entrepreneurs, and others who seek to build successful businesses. –Victor Hwang, Cofounder of T2 Venture Capital, coauthor of The Rainforest: The Secret to Building the Next Silicon ValleyWhen academic management research and operational business management look at each other, there is often a sizeable gap. Based on their own practice and variety of experience, Eric Ball and Joe LiPuma bring us a powerful and insightful view on essential themes such as leadership, international business, organization, and processes. Unlocking the Ivory Tower demonstrates how the academic and business worlds can efficiently get together to generate added value. –Dominique Carouge, Vice President Administration and Management at Sanofi, Member of the Global Leadership TeamAppealing to both academics and business leaders, Eric Ball and Joe LiPuma not only provide the reader with grounded insight into a selection of themes that are critical to business success, but offer a valuable resource in bridging the worlds of academia and business. Unlocking the Ivory Tower demonstrates how management research is relevant, and can be accessible to firms, in a very straightforward and concise manner. –Rickie A. Moore, Past Chair of the Management Consulting Division, Academy of ManagementBall and LiPuma do an impressive job of collecting and illuminating important business research in a wide range of areas. Even better, they translate that research into practical takeaways for managers. –Steven N. Kaplan, Neubauer Family Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance University of Chicago Booth School of BusinessPeter Drucker taught us that in today’s rapidly changing world, people “have to be prepared to live and work simultaneously in two cultures—that of ‘the intellectual,’ who focuses on words and ideas, and that of the ‘manager,’ who focuses on people and work.” Unlocking the Ivory Tower bridges those often-alien cultures beautifully, and in doing so it stands as a major contribution.  –Rick Wartzman, Director of the Drucker InstituteUnlocking the Ivory Tower is an excellent resource for business managers looking to make critical decisions based on best practices. The book represents a valuable summary of management research in key fields. Not only do Ball and LiPuma survey the literature past and present, but they inform what kind of research agendas can have the biggest real-world impact outside of the university environment. Their book should be required reading for both students and faculty in business schools globally.  –Audrey MacLean, Venture Investor, Consulting Professor, Stanford University, and Chairman, CoraidThis book offers practical guidelines for clear thinking and informed decision-making distilled from the best business research. Eric and Joe masterfully remove the academic clutter, bringing into focus simple yet powerful frameworks for thinking clearly and making informed business decisions. –Clint Korver, Cofounder of Ulu Ventures and Partner at Crescendo Ventures", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The sixth edition covers a remarkable range of interdisciplinary topics in an accessible manner. The text is a unique resource for anyone wanting to understand how human society on planet Earth often finds itself in peril, and what we can do about it.\" Roger Pielke, Professor of Environmental Studies, University of Colorado at Boulder, USA.\"Environmental Hazards has become the indispensable text for hazards students and scholars. The new edition brings together a wealth of updated and new case studies and examples. The common structure adopted for the chapters in Part II enables useful comparisons between hazard types and the varied risks and adaptation opportunities they present. This is a detailed and thorough treatment of the complex approaches to and challenges of hazard management.\" Dr Maureen Fordham, Enterprise Fellow Principal Lecturer in Disaster Management, University of Northumbria, UK.\"This is one of a minority that combines information on the range of disasters—natural, biophysical and technological. It is also one of the only textbooks that provides a good general overview of the basic concepts important to the study of hazards such as disaster trends, risk management, vulnerability, mitigation/risk reduction, adaptation, etc. I would further argue that the language, case studies, suggestions for further readings, web links, etc. contribute to the book’s pedagogical value for an undergraduate introductory text. If students have only one opportunity to learn about hazards in their undergraduate program then this book will indeed provide ‘the basics’.\" Jessica Lehman -The University of British Columbia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Without resorting to the knee-slapping antics of her last few books, Byars relays Bingo's questions and his answers, in a way that is so believable that readers may wonder if there isn't a Bingo in their classrooms.

A learning disability, which was not corrected until she was in her thirties, meant that schooling was a real struggle. It also meant that her dream seemed to be a distant mirage. The struggle of raising five children and being a wife to a shearer/farmer in a small town, taught her a lot about life and the grace of God. During this time, she also completed her teaching degree and worked many casual jobs, in order to ensure that the farm was viable.

Therefore, I thought it would be good to set the record straight. In my research I found I was wrong, terribly wrong. I have spent my entire adult life advancing a religious denomination that is directly responsible for not only participating in the practice of human bondage but also exhausting every bit of their energy to make sure slavery prospered as an American institution. As expected, I have raised an army of Southern Baptist voices that claim otherwise.

When not writing, Buck relishes spending time with his wife, Arlene, and their two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Jezebel and Samson.  Buck credits the two canines for their inspiration and input they have faithfully provided on their morning walks.  The Zawilla’s can be found either at their residence in Apex, North Carolina or their beach home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In between conversational walks with Jezebel and Samson, and an occasional Margarita, Buck is working on his second novel in the life of Madam President.

After serving as a researcher at McGill University in Montreal and The University of Virginia in Charlottesville, he returned to Texas in 1998 in an academic position. He has had a life-long preoccupation with science, music, stand-up comedy, barbecue, pulp fiction and other more lurid pastimes to be named later, if ever, and even then likely only to be revealed if compelled under a court subpoena. More recently, in 2005, he was bitten by the fantasy football bug which has proven resistant to twelve step programs, antibiotics and the scorn of his peers.

They would start fighting; pulling each other's hair and then the baby would start crying. I'm never having kids. This had to be against the law. In what state, I don't know, but I'm sure it was.           Finally, I would quiet them with a movie that kept their attention andthenhe come sliding over on the couch. My first instinctwasto punch him in the face, because his breath smelled like poop. Soon as he caught my eye slicing him up like a piece of Swiss cheese, he moved back to his corner. As the night went on, the children fell asleep on the floor. They were not about to pee in my bed. Once the baby fell asleep I put her in my mom's bed since it was bigger. The clock slowly ticked, 10:30 p.m. and still no parents in sight. It must have givenStinky time to smell his breath, because he ran upstairs and put some toothpaste on his tongue. When he came back the smell was gone. Here he goes sliding over here again. \"Would you move and back up off of me!\" \"Ah girl, why you acting like that, you know they ain't gonna be back till after midnight.\" He did have a point. That meant I'd have to deal with him for another two hours or so. Normally, I'd be in bed, but I knew he would have tried something. I would hate to commit murder and go to jail for killing somebody's nappy headed son.           I did scare him off for a little while. Then I think we both got bored and there he was right back beside me again and this time I didn't even notice. I was familiar with sex since my grandmother and I use to watch the soap operas during the summer. Basically, I knew what it was like, but had never experienced it. Sometimes I would sit in my room and pretend that I was one of the women on the soaps. The next thing I knew, his hand was going down my shirt. Now for a twelve-year-old, I know I shouldn't have been in a \"D\" cup, but I was. Apparently, he had done it before, because when I went to move his hand he lightened up a little. It didn't feel the way it looked on the soaps, but I guess I could pretend, seeing how he had no intention on stopping.            The lights were off and only the lighting from the television set the tone. Then he did the unthinkable. He put his hands down my shorts and into my panties, which for some reason were wet. I knew my period was not on so I was a little confused, but he wasn't. He moved his fingers around in my panties and then placed my hands down his pants. I didn't know what to think whenhestarted moving my hand up and down on his penis. Then he started shaking. 'Oh my God he's having a seizure. My mother's going to kill me, and then his mother is going to send me to jail.' After he finished shaking and there was this slimy stuff in my hand. \"Gross...get away from me. You peed on me. You are nasty.\" I said, snatching my hand away.\"No I didn't girl. You so dumb that was an orgasm\",he said. \"I don't care if it was a piano, get away from me.\"           Running up the stairs to wash or-gan-um or whatever he said it was off my hands, I thought to myself, 'that ain't never happen on the stories.' There wasn't enough soap in the bathroom for what I needed to do. Ooh, that was so nasty. How could anyone enjoy that on a regular basis? What was all the hype about?           This would be the norm for the next few years. Every time I went to baby-sit, or whenever they came to my house, there was someone with their hands on me. After awhile I thought it was normal. Learning the meaning of dry-humping and fondling were now a part of my normal vocabulary.", "related": ["B00GL6ID8I"], "rank": 2214793, "title": "Hidden Tears: It's Time to Expose The Enemy", "author": "Tweedy Poole", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a book that emerging social science researchers and clinical practitioners will find much in, particularly with regard to her passion for qualitative research and feminism.\"Sex Roles\"An intelligent, mature and important contribution to the kind of feminism we all need and want … Gilligan has written an important book which should be read by all, not only by girls and women, but also by boys and men.  Her invitation for all to join the resistance should be heeded, for its beneficiaries belong to humans of all genders and ages.  In this sense, we should all count ourselves as feminists of Gilligan’s type and thus make way for a democratic society of caring equals.\"USC Graduate Journal\"Helps heal the split between reason and emotion, mind and body, self and relationships, especially as they relate to gender identity. There is much food for thought in this work.\"Scientific and Medical Network\"InJoining the Resistance, Gilligan makes a useful distincton in the debate about the ethic of care, by which her earlier work has been characterized and criticized, to emphasize her main theoretical point: The way forward out of patriarchy is a democratic solution that frees women and men to pursue a human ethic of care.\"Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books“Carol Gilligan is one of the pre-eminent psychologists of our time. Joining the Resistance is a leap forward in what has become her life-journey, connecting psychology to culture. The book stands on its own as a work of art; it is beautifully written and like the best sort of novel, full of surprises.”Richard Sennett, New York University\"Original work expands our humane capacity. InJoining the Resistance, Carol Gilligan continues to inspire us. Hers is a generous art, clearing a road that leads to a thriving place - one of love and justice.

Imagining a more expansive version of the Nobel Prizes, the authors have given out 140 awards to worthy recipients in all branches of mathematics and the natural sciences. The chronologically arranged entries each average three pages in length and highlight a winner by providing biographical material as well as scientific background and the legacy of the person s innovation. Criteria for selection included the importance of the achievement, its practical applications, and the degree to which the innovation struck the authors as a brilliant achievement. Award winners are primarily the usual suspects, including Isaac Newton, Antoine Lavoisier, Michael Faraday, Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, and Wernher von Braun, though others are less well known, such as the discoverer of the cholera vaccine, Waldemar Haffkine, and the inventor of the piano, Bartolomeo Cristofori.... Novel in theme, packed with interesting details, and written in engaging prose, this volume is recommended for readers working on reports and those who have a general interest in the history of science. --Library Journal (September 1, 2013); Brian Odom", "related": [], "rank": 2661527, "title": "ebook,Michael Hart, Claire Parkinson,The Newton Awards: A History of Genius in Science and Technology,Washington Summit Publishers,SCIENCE / General,SCIENCE / History\" />", "author": "Michael Hart", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This gave her opportunities to write editorials after a semester of writing news as a reporter. The newspaper later won awards with the Columbia School of Journalism. Although unable to attend a college to continue her education in journalism, she continued to write short stories and plays. A short story about her dog Scotty was published in Guideposts magazine in 1952. A Christmas play she wrote but did not publish was performed in her church. As an army brat, Phyllis moved often. Books were her friends, and she enjoyed historical novels and cozy mysteries. She decided to try creating a cozy mystery when she toured a turn-of-the century house that had potential as a bed and breakfast. This is her first novel. Phyllis is a Christian, having dedicated her life to the Lord Jesus. She wanted to write a book that showed that faith and trust help one overcome times of trouble.

He is the founder of a ministry called the Brothers of Lunchtime Discipleship (BOLD) that provides scripture study and fellowship for men in his parish. He is co-founder of a small business, Christian Decks, Inc., whose mission is to develop faith-based games to inspire evangelization. Kevin enjoys outdoor activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, and spending time with his family.  All of these interests serve as inspiration for many of his poems.  Kevin has been writing poetry for about twenty years. One of his first poems was written in 1995, and is titled “Love is Like a Leaf.” This poem was selected for publication by The National Library of Poetry in a volume titled: Between the Raindrops.  His poem titled “Hope” was selected as one of the “Best Poems of 1996” by The National Library of Poetry, and published later that year. Kevin continues to develop his vocation to writing, and wishes to share his poetry with all his fellow Christians.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She begins with an overview of several major theories of psychotherapy, from venerable names ranging from Freud to Adler to Jung, and explores therapeutic approaches, including Gestalt, transpersonal, and integrative. Romanovsky details the suitability of therapies to personality, situation, and expectations, noting that all treatment methods are effective if practiced by a therapist who believes in and is committed to them. She offers perspective on individual versus group therapy and the incorporation of other practices, including meditation. Romanovsky also includes case studies to help readers grasp how patients interact with therapists and achieve awareness of inner struggles.

Now, at last in control of her own time and working from her home in rural West Yorkshire, she has been able to realise her dream of writing erotic romance herself. She draws on settings and anecdotes from her previous and current experience to lend colour, detail and realism to her plots and characters, but her stories of love, challenge, resilience and compassion are the conjurings of her own imagination. She loves to craft strong, enigmatic men and bright, sassy women to give them a hard time—in every sense of the word. When she's not writing, Ashe's time is divided between her role as resident taxi driver for her teenage daughter, and caring for a menagerie of dogs, cats, rabbits, tortoises and a hamster.", "related": ["B00IGEHKI2"], "rank": 902127, "title": "Sure Thing (Sure Mastery Book 2)", "author": "Ashe Barker", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Recently married, and with the birth of his daughter, the initial idea was to purchase an investment property and use this investment to fund his daughter's college tuition. Realizing that this was an effective strategy toward not only saving money but building equity and income, Michael continued to convert his investment funds from the stock market to brick-and-mortar investments in the real estate market. Michael was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, and spent his childhood in the adjacent city of Peabody. After attending Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where Michael earned a bachelor of arts, he returned to Massachusetts where he began a career in sales. In 2001, Michael married his wife, Marla.

She made aliyah to Israel to teach English as a Foreign language in 1980 and returned to Oregon during Thanksgiving of 1985. She became very active in defending Israel and started blogs in order to do this. Her idea was to simplify the news about Israel and condense it for people who had little time out of their busy schedule to read. When she retired she was able to join facebook in order to find more relatives in her pursuit of her family genealogy. There she met up with a youngSyrian who had discovered that his birth mother was Jewish and wound up advising and friending him as well as helping him with his English and Hebrew. From this friendship grew a story she felt must be told. Nadene lives in Gresham, Oregon where she continues to write in her blogs defending Israel. She has two children and a grandson of which she is very proud. Her newest addition to her family is a rescued 7 year old Lhasa Apso female, Molly, who insists on getting her out at 5:00am for a morning romp. This is healthy as Nadene felt she was becoming addicted to her computer and was missing out on walking.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
