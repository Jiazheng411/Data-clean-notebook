Butler has been writing novels for over twenty years, mostly science fiction for adult readers. But when it came time to introduce his nine year old son to the joys of writing, a change of genres was in order. He took on the challenge of creating a middle grade novel with the help of his son. They role played the dialog together to make sure it was how kids talked. They did research on the setting and science used in the story to ensure accuracy for inquiring young minds. They created, read, rewrote, edited and read again to get the story as perfect as it could be. The result is a story created for kids with kids that touches the heart, stirs the imagination and inspires the value of being a true friend when the chips are down. What does Mr. Butler think about the 3 year effort? \"It is easily the best work I have done because it was all straight from the heart.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2286827, "title": "Raptor Ravine", "author": "James L.

Both women live alone and share an immigrant past and the physical impairments of old age; their personalities are very different. An orthodox Jew, Tessie boycotted Horowitz's wedding to a gentile, does not fear death, advocates a pragmatic approach to life and is a dynamite gin player. The more emotional Pearlie loves to dance, is still a great cook, wants to go on living and believes that religion is in the heart. Horowitz intersperses her grandmothers' accounts of their childhood poverty and reminiscences of love, sex and childbirth and her own struggle to come to terms with her dying father's lung cancer and her yearning for a spiritual comfort that she receives, in part, from talking to Tessie and Pearlie, \"the smartest women I know.\" Photos.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Imagine you are traveling to New York and there are many different routes to get there. The route you take depends upon the point where your journey begins. If you are not aware of where you are, there is a good chance you will choose the wrong route, become lost and frustrated, and have to start all over again.Many topics are covered, including: thought and the mind, the power of the spoken word, love and relationships, marriage, children, food, health and healing, money and politics, spirituality, the Guru or Master, death, and religion as the root cause of racism.Written in an informal manner, White Lies Dark Truth discusses personal and social topics that society as a whole considers taboo. The author also offers techniques and exercises given at the end of each chapter that will help readers reprogram their minds and even question their own existence.As a teenager Mony Singh began questioning his own existence and experimenting with different meditation techniques. Along the way he met many Eastern and Western masters who imparted their knowledge to him.

After a youthful accident left him badly scarred and facing grueling physical therapy, Ariely's treatment required him to accept temporary pain for long-term benefit—a trade-off so antithetical to normal human behavior that it sparked the author's fascination with why we consistently fail to act in our own best interest. The author, professor of behavioral economics at Duke, leads us through experiments that reveals such idiosyncrasies as the IKEA effect (if you build something, pride and sentimental attachment are likely to give you an inflated sense of its quality) and the Baby Jessica effect (why we respond to one person's suffering but not to the suffering of many). He concludes with prescriptions for how to make real personal and societal changes, and what behavioral patterns we must identify to improve how we love, live, work, innovate, manage, and govern. Self-deprecating humor, an enthusiasm for human eccentricities, and an affable and snappy style make this read an enriching and eye-opening pleasure.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she had arrived at Crar, she had found the towering, fang-toothed demon terrifying. Only much later had she realised that the titanic monster’s intentions were quite honourable; what she had once interpreted as ravening hunger for her flesh, she now recognised as concern for her well-being. In the absence of Grimm Afelnor, the demon had been detailed to look after her, and she had to admit she could think of no better protector than the dour Shakkar. She knew her underworld guardian would die before he would let her down.“Just checking, Lady Baroness,” the grey, winged monster said, as he always did.“Thank you, Shakkar. Goodnight,” she said, resisting the impulse to kiss the impassive demon on the cheek. She could not have reached it, in any case.“Goodnight, Lady Drexelica,” the demon rumbled. “I hope you sleep well.” As silent as the passage of the moon, Shakkar slid out of the room and closed the door.Drex knew the huge demon was never able to enjoy the mortal surcease of sleep, and she therefore found his familiar, nightly words even more comforting. She would have preferred that Grimm were present to safeguard the domicile, but she accepted that this was not always possible.Drex understood, even if she did not appreciate, that Grimm had a vocation to fulfil. Despite the opulent conditions in which he lived, her lover was not a free man; in fact, he was more a slave than she would have been if the Questor chosen to condemn her to the Grivense authorities for her attempted theft of his purse.", "related": ["B008QZAACO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hated grammar just as much as I hated writing reports. I'd\nhave rather taken a basket weaving class than have taken an English class,\nregardless of the embarrassment. It was that bad. So now, some forty years\nlater, I find myself writing poetry, books, and newspaper columns and articles\nand I just can't stop. I think maybe, just maybe at some point in my early\nadulthood, creatures from outer space abducted me and did something to my\nbrain. I hope that's all they messed with. I enjoy writing immensely and\ncovering many different topics. I've had published both fiction and non-fiction\nbooks. Several newspapers in the U.S. and Canada have printed my columns (about\n450 and counting), and they are read by over 250,000 subscribers upon each\nincidence of publication. Mind you, I'm just getting warmed up. I'm currently\nworking on several different books simultaneously and the better I get at\nmultitasking, the quicker the books will see the light of day. I hail from the\nlittle town of Niceville, Florida which you've probably never heard of, but it\nsits in the panhandle of Florida along the shores of Boggy Bayou. No folks, I'm\nnot making this stuff up. Anyway, ever so often, I relocate to eastern New\nMexico because I like the dry air (lack of humuggity) and the wide open spaces.\nEventually though, I just can't resist the urge any longer to get back to the\nbayou and so I always end up going back for a spell. I'm a \"seawestern\" man and\nthat's a pretty complicated way to be, especially when it comes to home\ndecorating. I surely appreciate your interest in my books and if you've read\none already, thank you so much for that. If you've not had an opportunity to\nread one of my books yet, I think you ought to treat yourself to one right now.\nYou'll be entertained and informed and me, why-I'll be able to buy another bale\nof hay for one of our horses.", "related": ["B00CN0T2YU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It will save time and reduce stress for your entire leadership team. Most importantly, it will focus your time and energy on those areas that have the strongest links to student achievement.

Their findings are significant not only for teachers and administrators, but for state and national policy makers. We know how to improve student results and educational equity.

D. Holiday grew up in the poor farming community of Alto, Louisiana. She loves telling stories because words have always fascinated her and telling stories is in her blood. Although, her father never wrote a book, he told humorous stories of his childhood to anyone who would listen. Two of her nephews also enjoy writing. At the age of five, she remembers not having the luxury of paper and pencils. In those days, her parents’ top priority was putting food on the table. There was little money available to spend on paper and pencils, except for the school age children in the family. She refused to let the “lack of” these essential writing tools interfere with jotting down words, so she used discarded paper grocery bags and stubby pencils. When she could not find paper grocery bags, she brushed back the sandy soil at the edge of the porch, broke off a piece of her mother’s peach tree switch, and continued writing words in the sand. She and her ten siblings often missed school to help her parents work and put food on the table. Whenever she had the opportunity to return to the classroom, she worked hard to catch up on her writing assignments.  She resides in Friendswood, Texas, and enjoys spending time with family, traveling, and volunteering in the community.  She holds a Bachelor’s of Science in Management.", "related": [], "rank": 5079896, "title": "Leah's Uncompromised Abstinence", "author": "M. D.

Even for such a staggering sum, nobody takes the treaty seriously--until California's Senator Matt \"Bomber\" Nakamura endorses it. Since he'll lose his job if the treaty goes through, he becomes a national hero--the \"Martyr to Zilching the Debt\"--and the treaty gains support.But his wife Barbara suspects the real reason behind his endorsement: he arm-twisted the promise of a huge bribe from Japan's ambassador. Barbara is determined to stop her husband at any cost, to save the Californians he's betraying. She has no money, no power, no influence--just determination. Nobody listens outside California, though, once Matt points out all of the fun ways Washington can spend $60 trillion. Even worse, her Japanese mother thinks the treaty is a godsend, and criticizes Barbara for publicly speaking against Matt.Meanwhile in Japan, young robotics engineer Hiroshi Iwata gradually realizes that the California Treaty would be his key to a better life. Eventually Hiroshi will work hard to thwart Barbara's efforts to save California.Tags: East meets West, future, international, Japan, Japanese, Japanese culture, Mafia, politics, suspense, thriller, women, Yakuza", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, a playlet set in London  around 1600, involves a palace guard, a quirky Shakespeare, and  his lady of the title. A peevish Queen Elizabeth lords it over  them amusingly. On the same cassette, a shorter Shakes vs. Shaw  has Shakespeare debating George Bernard Shaw about which writer  is greater. The author is clever, but these curtain raisers are  trifles.  Filumena is a worthy production of a popular 1946 Italian  classic. For 25 years Filumena, a Neapolitan prostitute, has  been the sometime mistress of a stolid businessman from whom she  stole money to support her three illegitimate sons. Now she  wants to marry him and make them legitimate; only then will she  tell him which one is his. The majority of the actors do not  affect Italian accents. Brisk pacing keeps this romantic comedy  lively. This play, frequently revived in Italy, is recommended  for general libraries where drama, especially of foreign origin,  is sought. Stephen and Mr. Wilde fictionalizes events in 1882 when Oscar  Wilde was in Toronto on a lecture tour. Stephen, his 39-year-old  black valet, an illiterate slave until he was 19, uses words  like dignified, spontaneous, and modulated. Oscar receives brash  reporters at the hotel, one of whom identifies Stephen as a  fugitive murderer. This mixture of biography, stock characters,  and melodrama lacks conviction. Not recommended.

Flash forward to contemporary Cape Cod, Mass., where Aristotle \"Soc\" Socarides, a commercial fisherman who in the off-season becomes a quintessentially broke, wisecracking P.I., is hired by wealthy and sinister Frederick Walther, whose daughter Leslie has disappeared. Soc seeks a lead on Leslie at the marine laboratory where she once worked, but her caustic, womanizing ex-boss and lover, Tom Drake, is murdered before Soc has a chance to question him. Emphasis shifts to Drake's research with remote-controlled undersea vehicles capable of investigating phenomena out of the reach of human divers. Death-defying watery escapades ensue as Soc, Drake's enemies, Walther and the FBI close in on the mysterious sub of the prologue, wrecked off the Massachusetts coast. Soc, introduced in Kemprecos's The Cool Blue Tomb , is an appealing, witty protagonist; high-tech gadgets are explained clearly so as not to alienate the reader; and the Cape Cod locale is rendered with panache in this fast-paced, enjoyable yarn.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bradford Swift became an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction as an eleven-year-old boy when his next-door neighbor, who was a children's librarian, took pity on his single-parent mom. Bored out of his gourd with no one to play with but good 'ol mom, Swift drove her crazy until Mrs. Crabtree brought home a stack of books she knew would hook a young boy and give his mom some relief. It worked. He's been hooked ever since.For over two decades Swift has been conducting an experiment: “Is it possible to create a new context for life that is true to my deepest values, my sense of what’s possible, and true to my soul and spirit?  If it is possible, what will be the results?  Will it enhance my life?  Will I experience a true sense of purpose and meaning? Will I know at the end of the experiment that my life has mattered?”Becoming a writer of visionary fiction and non-fiction has been an integral part of this experiment, as was co-founding Life On Purpose Institute with his wife in 1996, being a life coach to assist others to create their own life on purpose, and training other Life On Purpose Coaches.Since selling his veterinary practice in the late 80’s to pursue a career as a writer and life coach, Dr. Swift has published over 350 magazine articles in dozens of national publication. Many of these have been part of a pet writing project: Project Purpose: to write and publish articles about people whose lives are dedicated to a bold and inspiring purpose or vision.He is also the author of visionary nonfiction including: Life On Purpose: Six Passages to an Inspired Life, Spiral of Fulfillment: Living an Inspired Life of Service, Simplicity and Spiritual Serenity, and From Spark to Flame: Fanning Your Passion & Ideas into Money-making Magazine Articles that Make a Difference.Dr. Swift attended Clarion West in Seattle to further hone his skill and passion for writing fantasy and science fiction. These two genres are forms of visionary fiction – fiction that first and foremost entertains while also enlightening and encouraging the reader to embrace greater possibilities in their own lives.Giving back to future generations of young adults and adults through visionary fiction and non-fiction is an integral part Dr. Swift’s legacy of a life on purpose.", "related": [], "rank": 2549265, "title": "Amberlin", "author": "W.

He obtained a Masters Degree in Mathematics from the University of Illinois in 1955. His professional career began in the aerospace industry, followed by co-founding Informatics Inc. in 1962, one of the first viable software companies. He ended his career in 1998 as a key executive with Sterling Software, Inc., the latter having acquired Informatics in 1985. Mr. Frank published technical papers related to numerical analysis and software engineering and authored Critical Issues in Software, a book dealing with software economics, published by John Wiley & Sons in 1983. His business career has led to the writing of the novel Corporate War: Poison Pills and Golden Parachutes, available at Amazon and in eBook format on Kindle and Nook. Beginning in 1996, Frank has been researching his family’s history, amassing a genealogical database of 35,000 names.  This research has led to the book Legacy: The Saga of a German-Jewish Family over Time and Circumstance, published by Avotaynu Foundation in 2003. Now Frank has turned to the little known event that foreshadowed the Holocaust, by chronicling the October 1940 deportation of over six thousand Jews from Baden, Pfalz and Saar. Frank identifies seven-hundred family members who were among these victims that ended up in Camp de Gurs, located in Vichy France.", "related": ["B0032JSJYK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We meet Sophia, the confident yet self-consciously declining grandmother, holding out in a run-down housing estate, who cares for the decrepit park while trying to inspire her granddaughter Sophia to break free from her upper-middle-class overscheduled day to appreciate the natural world; TC, a resourceful but stunted boy of nine, who retreats into his “secret garden” to escape the chaos of home life; and, most interestingly, Jozef, a dislocated Polish immigrant, adrift in the seedy, fast-food filled streets of London, who finds purpose and, eventually, solace in befriending TC and a neglected dog. The slow buildup of trust and dependence between Jozef and TC, culminating in a predictable brush with the law, proves to be the most fully developed and moving element here. Although Harrison’s great love for nature shines in her beautiful descriptions of how even the most humble green spaces supply succor to the shamed and disconnected, these lovely and leisurely meditations occasionally disrupt the narrative flow and character development. --Jonathan Schwartz", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A beautifully explicated journey to the heart of loving.\" -Dossie Easton, Marriage & Family Therapist, Co-author,The Ethical Slut\"To tackle the dos and don'ts that flood intimate relationships advice, Meg Barker's sharp, insightful, open-minded and friendly guide is here to help you navigate the mazes of modern love. Meg's pen is like a benevolent friend who's hand you don't want to let go. Hold on to Rewriting the Rules\"-Esther Perel, Author ofMating in Captivity\"The publication of the rule-debunking bookRewriting the Rulesis justified by its appeal to this massive audience looking for rules that work. Author Meg Baker subtly and seamlessly winds her way through the reader's psyche, deconstructing the search for rules that ward off the loneliness many people feel both inside and outside of relationships. Barker's concepts are well rooted in psychological theory and research, yet her use of popular media to illustrate the sources and the fallacy of relationship rules makes the book user-friendly for the general public. The author invites readers to consider the normalcy of confusion and uncertainty in life and relationships as they try to resolve the tension between how to find a connection with another human being and how to deal with that connection once in a relationship.\" -Suni Petersen,PsycCRITIQUES(Vol. 58, No. 24)\"Meg Barker clearly has a lot of experience in the field of love, sex and relationships, and this book is full of priceless nuggets of insight into the complexities and uncertainties of intimate relationships in contemporary Western culture. ... It offers information and advice in a jargon-free, friendly style, including many references from popular Western culture which non-therapists and non-psychologists may find accessible. There are questions to ask yourself and also useful diagrams simplifying complex ideas.\"- Suzanne Keys,Self & Society(Vol. 41 No. 2)\"Barker does have a real talent for challenging disturbing and rigidly held assumptions in our society and exposing their darker side and how this affects relationships. ... Many outside of our profession who are experiencing relationship problems would benefit hugely from reading this insightful book.

That is why so-called best-practice reforms typically fail: they create the illusion of progress, but not the reality. This important book goes beyond this lament to formulate a positive agenda of reform, built on incrementalism, problem-driven focus, and collaboration among stakeholders. Matt Andrews has seen the future, and it is in this book.' Dani Rodrik, Harvard University, and author of One Economics, Many Recipes'The Limits of Institutional Reform in Development points to the singular inability of international donors to promote their vision of good government, and explains how this is rooted in their failure to understand local context. More importantly, it suggests a way forward, not through preconceived models but through experimentation and adaptation.' Francis Fukuyama, Stanford University, and author of The End of History and the Last Man and Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap between Latin America and the United StatesIn this post-financial crisis era, many of us increasingly realize that we actually know little about how to govern human society for a good life. The author's insightful analysis makes a significant contribution to the literature. It has major implications for the study of public sector reforms in developing countries.' Jun Ma, Sun Yat-sen University, China'Andrews has a simple but bold idea: admit that no one really knows what to do about governance failings in poor countries. Deep six the World Bank-style public-sector reform blueprints that haven't worked. Define the problem instead of specifying the solution, adopt 'muddle through' instead of 'best practice', and stop counting on local champions. New World Bank president Jim Yong Kim should ask for a briefing on this book.' Nancy Birdsall, President, Center for Global Development, Washington, DC'For some time, developing countries have been told to improve their institutions by copying the institutions of the rich countries as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. Matt Andrews tells us why this approach has not worked: this is a landmark analysis that will change the way we both understand and design institutional reform.' Ha-Joon Chang, University of Cambridge, and author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism'Using a wealth of data and informative cases, this book convincingly shows that the export of institutional reforms to developing countries has often resulted in superficial changes that have had little or no impact. Mimicking institutional devices cannot replace profound changes in the basic operational norms of how the government in developing countries tries to solve real problems.'

Fifty-one-year-old Bud is a real estate agent and his wife, Franny, works at a junior high school. He and Franny discuss mortality and their life choices, including not having children; as a teen, Bud fathered a daughter who was given up for adoption. Before the funeral, he and the surviving Ritter siblings, known as the Nine, reminisce about growing up in the 1960s in Galveston, Texas. Money was tight, but times were good in their little house on 14th Street. Serendipitously, the home’s current owner allows the Nine to wander through the house one last, wondrous time. The author delivers a cohesive account of childhood, warts and all, and the enduring significance of a childhood home. Despite the novel’s brevity, Cruise crafts a realistic relationship among the Ritter kids and especially between Bud and Franny, whose married-couple banter rings true. The book teems with humorous expressions such as, “Christ on a cracker, I think I'm gonna blow!” and “I’m more of a holiday Catholic.” Anecdotes from the Nine’s collective childhood are similarly inventive and include a near-disaster by fire in a Christmas tree fort, averted by “The Patron Saint of Untoasted Children”; “The Legend of Lunchtime Horror”; and a fun-filled flight through a parking lot on a runaway grocery cart. The novel’s occasional serious moments are touching but not maudlin. Among its poignant comments is that today’s children don’t play much outdoors anymore; video games have trumped swings and slides. This novel may hold little appeal for readers in their 20s or early 30s, but it will likely engage and enchant Baby Boomers who remember their childhoods fondly.A nostalgic little gem of a novel, with a quietly powerful message.", "related": [], "rank": 2673574, "title": "14th", "author": "Sue Cruise", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This tale follows their adventures in a \"shoulda, coulda, woulda\" sort of way. Marcus evades questions about why he was in Toronto that night which brings about more complications. I wondered if their relationship would survive. Danielle-Claude Ngontang Mba is a great storyteller and sets a nice pace in this very interesting read. While this plot is complex it is also very realistic. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the descriptions of the music, the dancing and singing. The author researched this subject well and brought fascinating adventures to life, inspiring me to travel to Canada. This Could Have Been Our Song is a great story and I look forward to reading more books by Danielle-Claude Ngontang Mba.- Reviewed by Tracy Hanson for Readers' Favorite", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 3.85, "rating_total": 77.0}

This is due in part to a strong cultural belief in the family and its importance in various aspects of life, including business. By virtue of being innovative, flexible, networked, entrepreneurial, and efficient, Chinese family businesses have continued to prosper over the years and this has led to a great deal of interest in how they actually function.Written by A. B. Susanto—a notable family business practitioner and Chairman of The Jakarta Consulting Group—with the help of Patricia Susanto,The Dragon Networksheds some much needed light on this subject.Focusing on overseas Chinese family businesses, including those operating out of Southeast Asia, the authors offer an in-depth look at how these businesses are structured; which traditional Chinese values influence their family business practices; as well as how family relationships affect business management. Along the way, they also address the various challenges facing Chinese family businesses in today's rapidly changing environment, and explore what they are doing to survive and thrive for generations to come.Engaging and informative,The Dragon Networkuses real-world cases to highlight many of the issues discussed. For example, through the story of the Indonesian herbal company Nyonya Meneer, you'll gain valuable insights into how bitter family conflicts, that could potentially destroy a company, are managed. You'll also discover the essential role that wives play in Chinese family businesses through Lee Kim Hua—the matriarch of Genting Group, a conglomerate from Malaysia specializing in tourism, resorts, gaming, power generation, oil, and gas. Other topics covered that are integral to Chinese family business success include management style and leadership, succession planning and development, and dealing with risk.Based on solid research and filled with informative examples,The Dragon Networkoffers a rare look at how Chinese family businesses have operated so effectively for so long and reveals what it will take for them to continue to do so moving forward.", "related": [], "rank": 1692067, "title": "The Dragon Network", "author": "A.

A chance meeting at the cemetery brings new hope to her life, in the form of a budding relationship with Pete. A casual discussion about family, and a bet to research their family trees will lead to unknown events for Lisa. She finds that what she thought she knew was not the truth, and she is not who she thought she was. Rosemary Kind does a wonderful job of bringing to life the search for the truth to Lisa's identity, as well as telling the heartbreaking tale from her parents side of the story. The Appearance of Truth will challenge you to understand the pain of parents and confusion as Lisa searches for the truth.The idea that maybe you actually have a rich and famous ancestor in your family tree has sparked many a person to research their genealogy. The Appearance of Truth takes the idea of family trees and turns it upside down as Lisa sets out on a normal quest, only to unlock a mystery that has be hidden for thirty years. Rosemary Kind brings to life the many sides of this story, with each getting equal time, and none being slated as being the better side. The story takes the fears of finding out a secret and packages it into a novel worth the read. This was an engaging story that kept me interested to the very end.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So outrageous was the book that a Mrs. Marci Milf (no I am not kidding) Sued Urban Outfitters for even carrying the book, prompting even more sales based on the press generated. (Thanks Marci!) Master Sugoi has been practicing Origami since 1972, creating original forms and models in his teen years.  Though he is well able to make the classical figures of birds and animals, he knows that genre is well filled by others so he publishes what few will. If this book is too outrageous for you to share, Sugoi has created a milder version titled Origami for Dumdums available through Amazon.com.  It is the same book but without the cigar and joint, and makes no reference to his other book Pornogami.

We filmed at a ruined castle, a disused jail, a manor house (parts of it were a thousand years old and was home to King Canute), and a World War 2 aerodrome.Of course, ideas for a story flowed fast. Eventually, I wrote a novella called This Ghosting Tide, which owed some of its inspiration to those ghost hunting adventures with a camera team and a psychic. My role was to dress in black and talk about the hauntings from the perspective of a horror writer - I also got to drive the team's ghost hunting  bus, too. This was to add to the onscreen drama. On one occasion I drove the bus along a military runway after being reassured that aircraft didn't land there anymore.The guys in military uniforms that I saw in the control tower hadn't been told that the runway wasn't in use. They stared at me in shock as I drove the bus along the runway. Worse was to come: aircraft landed just a few minutes after I'd driven clear.  Not only was it an active military runway, I discovered it was also the designated European landing site for the Space Shuttle if it couldn't land in the United States. You can imagine the kind of nightmares I had the weeks following that escapade;--)  Such dramas aside, I wrote This Ghosting Tide, a story with humour and ghostly goings on. Now it has been reissued as an ebook under the new title of The Spirited Sea. I hope you enjoy the book, and if you go looking for ghosts yourself: GOOD LUCK! AND GOOD HUNTING!~ Simon Clark", "related": ["B00EV49D2C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cook's book should thus be of significant use to those interested in Adorno and critical theory, cultural studies and mass communication, and contemporary social theory.  Adorno's work itself is transdisciplinary and Cook presents him in a fashion in which he could be of use to a broad transdisciplinary audience (Journal Of Communication)Adorno's speculative thinking in the service of norms such as freedom, autonomy, and spontaneity serves as a prototype of social and political practice that might overcome the reification and narcissism endemic to contemporary mass culture.

Having quite a diverse background, she has never been quite sure what country she comes from, and is inclined to wonder whether it really matters.  Safie had an unconventional early childhood, which she feels sparked her interest in books about orphans and children caught up in adventures far from home.   A voracious reader as a child, she was greatly inspired by such authors as E. Nesbit, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and Roald Dahl.   Safie was eight years old when she finished her first story, which was about a soldier on the front lines during World War I.  She spent some of her childhood in Maidenhead in Berkshire where she has happy memories of imitating the Railway Children by playing near the railway tracks behind her home; although she would like to point out that the trains were much slower and fewer then and that this would not be wise behaviour to imitate today.  When she was 12, her life changed significantly after her family moved to Ireland, but she continued to write and always intended to be an author.  When she was a student at University College Dublin, however, Safie decided to take a break from writing in order to gain more life experience, in the hope that this would give her work greater authenticity.  She says that this was a big mistake and does not advise any other writers to do the same.   Over the next few years, Safie lived in several different countries and worked at many different jobs; some she enjoyed, and some she hopes never to have to do again.  However, she did not stop writing entirely;  she wrote a number of film scripts, and some of them were made into short films.  Safie returned to novel writing when she was 30, nearly a decade later than she had intended.  She now lives with her family in the countryside in Offaly, Ireland.  She was inspired to write The Galian Spear by her two oldest children, who love adventure and fantasy stories and are always running out of books.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From my vantage point, humans are the most unpredictable, astonishing, hateful and sacrificing creatures. I want to understand us (humanity) better and, for me, understanding of humanity comes from writing fiction, and examining what people might do when they feel no one is watching, what people are capable of (horrible and great), and imaging how seemingly normal people would react if they had exhausted the rational (and sometimes irrational) options.

It was just the 'norm' to grow up breathing in second hand smoke in a property that had more leaks and cracks than a broken teapot. My favorite story had to be when the family went to a restaurant for Easter and tried to act 'normal.' It was hilarious as within seconds their freak side started to slowly but surely become exposed. What a funny yet still strangely relatable incident. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good old walk down Memory Lane and a few belly laughs at the same time.", "related": [], "rank": 3182982, "title": "I Probably Shouldn’t Poison My Mother eBook", "author": "Randi Tyler", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why can't\nwe figure this disease out? We spend millions of dollars and all we do is suffer.\nWe lose productive time and sufferers are labeled as a type of personality.\nPeople make fun of patients with IBS and colleagues treat them as social\noutcasts. There is no help given to them from the medical community. Are\ndoctors unable to help? Is science impotent against this disease? Why are these\npeople sentenced to suffer for life? Or is it that we never understood the\ndisease well enough? In our quest to explain the bowel dysfunction we went too deep\ninside the jungle that we lost the big picture. We know more about the structure\nof colon cells than what the colon contains and how the stool moves around in\nthe colon.Over the last 15 years of my medical\npractice I have been perplexed and distressed by the sheer number of patients\nwho continue to suffer from Irritable Bowel Syndrome even after an extensive\nmedical workup. Patients are so confused that they don't want to tell the\ndoctor where exactly the pain is, as it is everywhere and the doctors do not\nhave any answers. This forced me to questionwhy? As I learned from my mentors and the current textbooks, I\nrealized the limitations of the current thought-process. I was encouraged by my\nmentors to ask questions and think outside the box and even though my mentors did\nnot have answers for all my questions, they showed me the path. Once I graduated the structured curriculum, I\nstarted exploring. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is nothing new; humans have\nsuffered from symptoms similar to Irritable Bowel Syndrome since we came into\nexistence. This thought prompted me to explore the medical archives and\nliterature that are over one thousand years old for similar conditions and\ntheir respective solutions. Even though clinicians in the last millennium did\nnot have our technologies available to them, they had time and patience. They\nmade observations and clinical correlations that were far superior to anything\nbeing described now. Suffering from recurrent chronic abdominal pain was\nnothing new and was not killing the patients but was a recurrent painful phase\nthat these patients suffered from. Learning from those descriptions and adding\non the modern technology and imaging a brand-new insight started developing in\nsuch disorders. The same patients I once feared the most taught me more than I\ncould have ever imagined. They started teaching me new theories that forced me\nto go back to the basics in medicine. Suddenly things started to make sense.Voila, I hit the jackpot. The patients'\nsymptoms started making physiological sense and their symptoms started getting\nbetter when treated with these new insights. My business training taught me to\nbe consumer-oriented, realistic, and to question every assumption. Yet my\nmedical training taught me to hold on to the defined conditions--the two\nphilosophies collided and complemented each other to provide well-rounded\ninferences.This book makes a humble effort in\ncorrecting this void. In my research I feel indebted to physicians and mentors from\nthe past whose work had been preserved and made available due to modern\ntechnology. These include: Aretaeus of Cappadocia, Ayurveda literature\n(multiple authors), Thomas L. Brunton, MD; Henry M Field, M.D., William\nArbuthnot-Lane, MS; Henry L. Bockus, MD; Arthur F. Hurst, MD; Jamie S Barkin,\nMD; Premashis Kar, MD and several others. With a noble intent driven by my desire\nto provide solutions to despairing patients, I humbly share this information\nwith the extensive readership.", "related": ["B00CZBZRK0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Christopher\nGreyson and I am a storyteller.\nSince I was little boy, I dreamt of what mystery was around the next\ncorner, or quest lay over the hill. If I couldn't find an adventure, one\n usually found me, and now I weave those tales into my stories.\nI am blessed to have written the best-selling Jack Stratton mystery\nseries with over 125,000 eBooks and paperbacks in distribution. The\ncollection includes \"Girl Jacked\", \"Jack Knifed\", and \"Jacks Are Wild\".\nMy latest novel \"Jack and the Giant Killer\" is due out summer of 2014.\nMy background is an eclectic mix of degrees in Theatre, Communications\nand Computer Science. Currently I reside in Massachusetts with my lovely\n wife and two fantastic children. My wife, Katherine Greyson, who is my\nchief content editor, is an author of her own romance series\n\"Simplicity\".\nMy love for tales of mystery and adventure began with my grandfather, a\nWorld War I decorated hero. I will never forget being introduced to my\ngrandfather's friend, a WWI pilot who flew across the skies at the same\ntime as the feared legendary Red Baron. My love of reading and\nstorytelling eventually lead me to write \"Pure of Heart\" a young adult\nfantasy that I plan to release later in 2014.\nI love to hear from my readers. Please go to ChristopherGreyson.com. I\nplan in the next coming months to add free content including side\nstories and vignettes involving the characters from the series. Please\nsign-up for my mailing list and receive periodic updates on this and new\n book releases. Thank you for reading my novels and I hope my stories\nhave brightened your day.\nSincerely,\nChristopher Greyson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 49, "rating_average": 4.6327, "rating_total": 227.0}

Rainey’s great strength is to take very complex material and present it in an accurate, but friendly and accessible way.  This is an excellent companion book and textbook for any student—or general reader—anyone working his or her way through the Laozi or Zhuangzi.—Jennifer Oldstone-Moore, Wittenberg University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Likewise the second volume, which appeared in 1926. The book details Hitler's childhood, the \"betrayal\" of Germany in World War I, the desire for revenge against France, the need for lebensraum for the German people, and the means by which the National Socialist party can gain power. It also includes Hitler's racist agenda and his glorification of the \"Aryan\" race. The few outside the Nazi party who read it dismissed it as nonsense, not believing that anyone could--or would--carry out its radical, terrorist programs. As Hitler and the Nazis gained power, first party members and then the general public were pressured to buy the book. By the time Hitler became chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, the book stood atop the German bestseller lists. Had the book been taken seriously when it was first published, perhaps the 20th century would have been very different.Beyond the anger, hatred, bigotry, and self-aggrandizing,Mein Kampfis saddled with tortured prose, meandering narrative, and tangled metaphors (one person was described as \"a thorn in the eyes of venal officials\"). That said, it is an incredibly important book. It is foolish to think that the Holocaust could not happen again, especially if World War II and its horrors are forgotten. As an Amazon.com reader has pointed out, \"If you want to learn about why the Holocaust happened, you can't avoid reading the words of the man who was most responsible for it happening.\"Mein Kampf, therefore, must be read as a reminder that evil can all too easily grow. --Sunny Delaney", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": 706694, "title": "Mein Kampf", "author": "Adolf Hitler", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student - for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, occasionally grooming them and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a the only conclusion possible. God is a cat!

I tear my gaze away, afraid that I'll fall into those shadowy green pools and be swept away.\"Measurements? Are you ordering a coffin for me?\" I joke, still not meeting his eyes.He laughs a bit too long. \"Just more appropriate clothes, Mister Hardwick. These books, much like the Christian bible, are specific in what worshipers must wear.\" He notices the alarm on my face and smiles a thoroughly disarming smile. \"Don't worry, Mister Hardwick, my tailor isn't making you robes or a nun's habit.\" \"Well okay then. If there's a uniform at least I hope it doesn't involve any silly hats. I spent a summer working at Hot Dog on a Stick and we had to wear these hats that literally were the ugliest things ever.\"He pulls an old, worn, cloth tape measure from his pocket. \"Now, if you could please strip down?\"For a moment I consider stalling. But why wouldn't I want to take my clothes off for him? Maybe he'll take his off, too, and we can measure each other. My hoodie hits the floor. My shirt goes up over my head and I almost scream because suddenly Sebastian is there, behind Mister Slate like his shadow. The guy has little cat feet. He's a ninja receptionist.And he's holding a camera.\"What's that for?\"\"Don't worry about the photographs,\" Mister Slate says. \"My tailor has peculiar methods but his work is worth it. He uses hand measurements for sizing and crafting but the photos will allow him to choose the perfect shade of fabric to match your lovely eyes.\"I blush.Sebastian openly smirks at me and aims the camera.Not for the first time that morning I wonder how many young men have been through this with Mister Slate. Am I the third or the thirty-third? What happened to all the others? And if he's such a recluse, why does he have a tailor on speed dial?Slate circles around behind me, stands so close that his breath burns the back of my neck. He's giving off waves of heat like a furnace. My head swims from his presence. And then his arms reach around me and pull the measuring tape tight across my chest and shoulders, restraining me sweetly. My cock jumps in my pants and I realize he's going to want to measure my inseam and that might be a problem. He holds the tape tautly, squeezing it until his control over me becomes definitive. When he releases the cord a tightness remains, as if the shadow of the cord lingered, binding me to him.He repeats the actions on my waist, my wrists, my elbows. Each time he squeezes until I feel a measure of control slip away from inside me. Sebastian shoots photos, hovering at the periphery like a ghost. And as the tape falls away the bindings remain. Slate is behind me for the entire process. What does his face show when no one is looking?The tape measure slips around my neck and all thoughts evaporate like fog before the sun. Slate squeezes it sweetly and my blood slows, my breath quiets. He's standing so close to me now, his body brushing against my back, making my head swim with his scorching heat. His breath tickles my ear. The cord tightens on my neck and my breathing stops entirely. A groan slips from my lips and I'd be embarrassed if I wasn't so incredibly, thoroughly turned on. My erection is straining against my jeans painfully. Sebastian gets some great shots of it, I'm sure.\"", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 428963, "title": "Fifty Shades of Gay Tentacles", "author": "Jacqueline Sweet", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
