More mature readers, on the other hand, may be put off by the simplistic story and the slack pace. The city's gargoyles meet monthly on a moonless night and, like good Irishmen, bemoan change and the loss of the good old days. When vandals break into St. Patrick's Church, Paddy, its resident gargoyle, calls on old Templeton, a Knight of Malta who drives an ancient Rolls Royce for weddings, to help him apprehend the miscreants. Paddy also brings to life the Rolls Royce's hood ornament, which Templeton tells him is a gryphon, not a gargoyle. Investigating the scene of the crime with his thirtyish policeman godson, Marcus Cassidy, Templeton finds Death's Deputy at the church, expecting his due. In a nice touch, Paddy argues with the deputy to allow the old man more time to discover who's behind the break-in. Heavy in its piety and exposition of Celtic history, this novel is a determined tourist guide to Dublin sites; however, James Joyce did some of the same thing, and Ulysses is still going strong.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The balanced selection of women and men is similar  to that found in Henry Louis Gates's Norton Anthology of African  American Literature (LJ 2/01/97), but the inclusion of  lesser-known figures and works is aimed at focusing on the  ideology of the renaissance, gay and lesbian themes, and  differences in gender-based issues. Countee Cullen, Nella  Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors  represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry,  prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as  illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define  the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events  by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to  broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous  research in the field of African American women's literature and  include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how  their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

Although accepting of his status as a great innovator in the struggle against racism, violence, and, just then, colonialism, Gandhi feared that enthusiasm for his ideas tended to exceed a deeper understanding. He says that he was after truth rooted in devotion to God and attributed the turning points, successes, and challenges in his life to the will of God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices (he called himself a fruitarian), celibacy, andahimsa, a life without violence. It is in this sense that he calls his bookThe Story of My Experiments with Truth, offering it also as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps. A reader expecting a complete accounting of his actions, however, will be sorely disappointed.Although Gandhi presents his episodes chronologically, he happily leaves wide gaps, such as the entiresatyagrahastruggle in South Africa, for which he refers the reader to another of his books. And writing for his contemporaries, he takes it for granted that the reader is familiar with the major events of his life and of the political milieu of early 20th-century India. For the objective story, try Yogesh Chadha'sGandhi: A Life. For the inner world of a man held as a criminal by the British, a hero by Muslims, and a holy man by Hindus, look no further than these experiments.--Brian Bruya", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

For whatever reason, most pastors dream and pray towards seeing their ministry grow in influence and numbers. There is nothing wrong with that. At best a small church is a distant cousin of the larger ministry. While sharing some things in common, their diversity must be understood if their ministry is going to realize all that God intended it to be. \"Whats good for the goose is not always good for the gander. Dr. McIntosh has the ability to analyze the similarities and differences, surface the important differentiating factors and communicate them effectively to the broader church public. I believe Dr. McIntoshs book will encourage the churches regardless of their size to accept their limitations of their demographics and build solidly on those principles and practices that address their specific individual needs. One Size Doesnt Fit All will encourage, break the complacency of others, and hopefully refocus churches on the realities of their mission accepting both its limitations and potential. Each size ministry has its unique opportunities and its consistent problems. What works on a size C ministry may not be effective at all in a size A ministry. Dr. McIntoshs insights and analytical abilities enable him to surface for us those non-negotiables that must be in place if a ministry of any size is going to be blessed. Building on the non-negotiables are the unique characteristics of the individual church of whatever category.  --Joe Aldrich, president emeritus, Multnomah Bible College and Biblical SeminaryGary McIntoshs book, One Size Doesnt Fit All, is the easiest and most informative book on church leadership I have ever read. Why didnt a few seminary professors teach me this stuff twenty five years ago? It would have saved me and some parishioners a lot of grief along the way. Garys description of the small, medium, and large church with its needs and expectations is a gold mine of practical insights for all pastors, no matter what size church they lead. This book will be a classic in the area of church leadership and growth.  --Dr. Michael Bradaric, senior pastor, Magnolia Baptist Church, Anaheim, CAIf only I had been able to read this book eighteen years ago when I became a pastor. What a difference it would have made! This is the most significant book Ive read in the last twenty-four months. It is a must read for every pastor, lay leader and committed church member. I intend to use One Size Doesnt Fit All extensively as I help churches to grow. This book has my enthusiastic endorsement.  --Dr. Mark Belokonny, church consultantIn this book Dr. Gary McIntosh uses his warm conversational style and vast years of experience in church analysis and consulting to provide a book of wisdom for pastors. We dont need more church growth information, but we do need more wisdom to apply the principles of growth and leadership in the unique context of the churches in which we minister. I believe Gary provides this wisdom in One Size Doesnt Fit All.  --Dr. David H. McKinley, senior pastor, Boca Raton Community Church, Boca Raton, FLNobody knows the organizational structure and social dynamics of the church better than my friend Dr. Gary McIntosh. I highly recommend this insightful book, which will enlighten your understanding of the critical differences that exist between various sized churches and how they function.  --Dr. Neil T. Anderson, president and founder, Freedom in Christ MinistriesReading this book and gleaning its insights into the churchs orientation, structure, direction, growth, and so forth will save the so-called experienced pastor as well as the new pastor much frustration and pain in leading and ministering more effectively in the local church.  --Aubrey Malphurs, professor, Dallas Seminary and President of Vision Ministries InternationalThe church is one of the most important institutions in our society today. In a world thats changing so fast, we need a little help in making sure the church stays on course. Gary McIntoshs new book One Size Doesnt Fit All is helpful to the small or large church trying to grow. This easy to read parable will help us bring out the best in our churches, no matter what their size.  --Ken Blanchard, coauthor ofThe One Minute ManagerTheres something here for all churches. This book is an insightful resource for pastors, church boards and staff, and people interested in church growth.  --CBA Marketplace, July 1999This book is a process of wisdom for church leaders in understanding the changes that impact churches at each stage of their development. This material was researched well, practical in nature and insightful for all church leaders. After serving in small, medium, and larger churches I wish that this material was available twenty five years ago. I wish every church leader would read and apply these principles.  --Dr. J. Michael Broyles, executive pastor, Grace Baptist Church, Santa Clarita, CAThis is absolutely a great book. Every denominational leader should make sure that their pastors have a copy of this book. It is the most enjoyable, practical, and capsulated version of church growth dynamics I have ever seen. I sat down and read through it in one sitting. It is great information encased in an enjoyable story. I know I will find myself referring to One Size Doesnt Fit All regularly in my ministry.  --Dr. Gil Stieglitz, senior pastor, Twin Lakes Community Church, Palmdale, CA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All topics are to be dealt with fairly and substantively, and articles are to be balanced and judicious.The Fountain believes that scientific thinking and religious-spiritual life are two aspects of reality and the ideal person and society exist within the union of both. In due appreciation of this conviction, The Fountain avoids extremism of any kind and does not focus on solely religious teachings nor solely materialist science, the first of which may lead to bigotry and the latter to unbelief.The Fountain is committed to illuminating both the minds and the hearts of readers by covering scientific as well as spiritual topics, addressing both components of human existence. The Fountain adheres to the belief that the entire universe and whatever exists beyond our senses are manifestations of the Divine Names of God Almighty, and that scientific discoveries open up new gates and reveal broader dimensions leading to the Truth, making us realize the essence and meaning of creation.The Fountain is concerned with the global problems of the modern world and highlights social topics; for example, maintaining peace in the world, cultural diversity, enhancing the overall welfare of society, education, health-care, preserving the ecological and environmental balance, divorce, juvenile problems, alcohol and all kinds of addiction, and keeping the young away from crime. Universal ethical values, such as respect and care for parents, honoring the elderly, safeguarding the family as the kernel of a sound society, love and compassion for all, neighborliness, hospitality, charity, and the like.Kindle Magazines are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.This magazine does not necessarily reflect the full print content of the publication.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Those are just some of the reasons it's an oft-assigned text in colleges, a market this beautifully annotated, wide-format edition addresses nicely. Joining seven other titles in Norton's handsomely produced \"Annotated\" series, the book offers 32 pages of color illustrations (not seen by PW), 150 b&w; period illustrations, and a two-column format that has Stowe's text at left, and the annotations at right.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Freidberg provides a masterful account of the complex web of labor practices, technological innovations, corporate controls and consumer choices that have produced the items that confront us each time we open the refrigerator door.Freshsuccessfully uses the stuff of everyday life to explain complex historical, cultural, and social phenomena. After reading this compelling work, you'll never look at a carton of eggs the same way again.--Carolyn de la Peña, University of California, DavisIn this lively and compelling book, Freidberg unearths the secrets within our refrigerators as she explores what is natural and unnatural about freshness. How have commerce and industry shaped our seasonless abundance? Where did the fruit grow? How far have the beef and fish traveled? Whose labor and risks do the vegetables hide?Freshshows why such questions matter as it reveals how our notions and expectations of fresh food changed over the last century. It challenges us to look differently at our food.--Pamela Walker Laird, author ofPullandAdvertising ProgressFreidberg opens the fridge on a world few have considered: how the advent of cold storage subverted ideas of freshness, shifted power from consumers and producers to middlemen, and virtually eliminated seasonality. We all like lettuce in February, but Freidberg's ingenious and spiritedFreshserves to remind us of its technological, environmental, and social cost.--Elizabeth Royte, author ofBottlemaniaandGarbage LandIn this highly readable and sophisticated book, Freidberg traces the ambiguous history of freshness in food. Despite its 'natural' associations, freshness has been produced, engineered, marketed, and valued in a variety of ways over the course of the last century. Broadly accessible, richly comparative, and written with flair,Freshwill appeal to a wide audience.--Julie Guthman, author ofAgrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in CaliforniaFreshpaints a fascinating picture of our changing views of perishable food...It is the historical detail ofFreshthat throws so much light on why we now eat the way we do...Freidberg writes elegantly and goes beyond the technical to draw out this paradox at the heart of today's culture of consumption: we have ended up with a food system that promotes both novelty and nostalgia, obsolescence and shelf life, indulgence and discipline.--Felicity Lawrence (The Guardian2009-05-02)Freidberg--tracking the movement of beef, eggs, fruit, vegetables, milk and fish from source to table--shows how technology, abetted by modern public relations, has changed the way we eat...Freidberg writes with wit and clarity, and her sense of humor extends to her choice of illustrations.--Aram Bakshian Jr. (Wall Street Journal2009-04-25)Few can read this thought-provoking book without thinking that although the benefits of modern food production are real, they are bought at an extravagant price. We could, if we tried, be more sensible in our demands on farmers, more resistant to the lures of advertisers, more thoughtful about the origins of our food, and more alert to the effects food production has on the environment and the people who produce it. Ms. Freidberg's book is a good place to start because it unravels the tangle of science and economics that puts food on our tables. Readers will find that the word \"fresh\" will never be quite the same again.--Claire Hopley (Washington Times2009-05-26)Fascinating and meticulously documented...Even as some of us beat a path to the farmers market or CSA, the history [Freidberg] describes affects the selections available and their path to our refrigerator. She gives us much to ponder and presents it in a highly readable volume largely devoid of value judgments. I learned a lot. Give it a read. It will indeed give you a fresh look at your food.--Janet Majure (foodperson.com2009-06-08)A dietary-cum-social history of the Mark Kurlansky/Michael Pollan sort, this smart, sweeping, and timely volume--appearing at a moment when buying locally and eating organically are fashionably responsible quests--considers the conundrums of industrial freshness. According to Freidberg, a Dartmouth professor, we all crave access to healthful, seasonal foodstuffs, yet we hunger equally for year-round convenience and value. The result: to open a refrigerator is to access a Pandora's box of compromise and freighted trade. Cold storage, Freidberg argues, has altered tastes, damaged the environment, hurt the consumer, and helped facilitate the less-than-salutary shift from localism to globalism. The stories of six staples--beef, eggs, fruit, vegetables, milk, and fish--both reinforce her thesis and stand as discretely engaging narratives, each rendered with clarity and flair. Food, truly, for thought. (The Atlantic2009-07-01)InFresh, Susanne Freidberg chronicles how expectations about beef, fish, milk, eggs, fruit and vegetables have shifted over the past century. Freshness means more than the absence of biochemical decay. It is bound up with our notions of purity, nutrition and beauty. And these ideas have adapted to the rise of a technology that most of us now take for granted--refrigeration.--Jascha Hoffman (Nature2009-06-18)Six categories of food are placed under the microscope in this survey of shifting cultural values. Beef, eggs, vegetables, fruit, milk, and fish are each examined in Freidberg's extensively researched and engagingly written account.--Lara Killian (popmatters.com2009-07-10)All in all fascinating and clear evidence for the protean nature of freshness... By the end of the book, the reader is acutely aware of the point that [Freidberg] reinforces in her brief epilogue, namely that freshness comes at a price, that there is no utopia of freshness, and that the ability to enjoy fresh foods is a privilege of the wealthy parts of the world...For anyone who is interested in figuring out the basic ideas that inspire contemporary eating and food production,Freshis essential reading.--Rachel Laudan (rachellaudan.com2009-08-05)French fruit farmers, Argentine cattle ranchers, Mexican dairy farmers hidden from view in pastoral Vermont and Hong Kong seafood aficionados all enter into this lively and edifying account. The book includes a sweeping survey of how ideas of freshness vary culturally, but have invariably been influenced by urbanization and globalization--and by technological innovations that preserve the illusion of straight-from-the-source freshness...It is a lively, engaging book.--Prashanth A K (Times Higher Education2009-09-03)[A] meticulously researched social history of our relationship with perishable food.--P.D.

Following a stirring preface by William Lloyd Garrison (who, nearly 20 years after he first met Douglass, would himself lead the black troops fighting from the North in the Civil War), the not-yet-30-year-old author recounts his life's story, showing effective and evocative use of language as well as unflinchingly examining many aspects of the Peculiar Institution of American Slavery. Douglass attributes his road to freedom as beginning with his being sent from the Maryland plantation of his birth to live in Baltimore as a young boy. There, he learned to read and, more importantly, learned the power of literacy. In early adolescence, he was returned to farm work, suffered abuse at the hands of cruel overseers, and witnessed abuse visited on fellow slaves. He shared his knowledge of reading with a secret \"Sunday school\" of 40 fellow slaves during his last years of bondage. In his early 20's, he ran away to the North and found refuge among New England abolitionists. Douglass, a reputed orator, combines concrete description of his circumstances with his own emerging analysis of slavery as a condition. This recording makes his rich work available to those who might feel encumbered by the printed page and belongs as an alternative in all school and public library collections.Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Conrad Jones is a 42 year old Author, who lives in Warrington, Cheshire. He worked in senior management at McDonalds Restaurants Ltd from 1989-2002. On march 23rd 1993 he was managing the Restaurant in Warrington`s Bridge St when two Irish Republican Army bombs exploded directly outside the store, resulting in the death of two young boys and many casualties. Along with hundreds of other people there that day Conrad was deeply affected by the attack, which led to a long term interest in the motivation and mind set of terrorists.          Later years turned his focus to tensions in the Middle East and beyond. The rise of Islamic Extremism and its determined Mujahideen fighters is the focus of Soft Target, which was published and is selling well despite not being represented. The title and the Author have been featured in six regional newspapers, and three BBC Radio interviews.               The Soft Target novels are based around a character called John Tankersley, nicknamed Tank. He is the lead agent of the Terrorist Task Force, which is an elite Special Forces group tasked with wiping out terrorist attacks internationally. The trilogy is selling but is still the property of the Author. Conrad feels that `Tank` has any number of potential plots left. At the moment he is on target to complete the fourth in just over twelve months from beginning part one.

Harris portrays the teachings of Jesus and his followers as a mindset that requires knowing one's inner meaning that comes from the heart. Jesus, referenced in multiple scriptural references, espoused the firm belief that faith is based on knowing...not hoping. Harris' in-depth research of Biblical scripture and history offers unique perspectives and well-founded premises to support his discussion of Jesus' simple message. According to Harris, Jesus taught that we live in a unified universe, free of judgment, in which we are seeking our individual spirituality. Organized religion is a man-made institution that teaches the faithful about the dogma of good, evil, sin and a punitive God. -.\"Jesus Taught It, Too...\" explores the concept that a true meditative state is found only when you are free of emotional, spiritual, and physical baggage. Through the recognition that God is not exclusionary you can reap physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional wealth. \"Jesus Taught It, Too...\" presents complex theocratic beliefs in simple, straight-forward language. The Law of Attraction addresses the powerful influence of positive thinking in the acquisition of physical and material needs. Jesus taught that by applying these same principals to one's spiritual life, one's physical and material needs will be met as a natural result of their application. Harris challenges the reader to \"believe in the best with an inner conviction...and it will manifest in your life.\" This book's intriguing but down-to-earth message will appeal to any reader seeking to broaden their spiritual horizon.Shannon Evans \"My Writing Mentor\"----", "related": ["B00C7Q72IS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The power of informed choice.4. The power to love hard questions.5. The power to love enemies.6. The power to forgive.Too often we look at the Bible through the prism of doctrinal structure. But first the Bible is a story line—the only fully true story ever told. This story line is the history of God’s relationship and conversation with us, and ours with one another.Only when we fully understand this story line and live according to its premises will true power emerge in our lives. For those of us who are believers in the gospel, living out the six pillars produce in us honest lives in the presence of all people—believers and skeptics alike.

Paradoxically, he was to become known as \"The Muscular Phenomenon.\" He was born in Bregenz, a town in the extreme western tip of Austria, on June 28, 1882. Although as a child he had been sickly and of poor physique, by long training in weightlifting and gymnastics he became a phenomenon of muscularity and strength. Although standing only 5 feet 3 3/4 inches and weighing at his best from 145 to 147 pounds, Maxick set records in weightlifting that few heavyweights of his day could equal. Outside of straight weightlifting, Maxick showed up equally well. Indeed, in hand-balancing and gymnastics he could perform some astounding feats. As would he expected in view of his extraordinary strength, Maxick had a superb muscular development. So completely were all his voluntary muscles under his control that he could make any desired group \"dance\" in time to music. He was, in fact, one of the first great exponents of the art of \"muscle control,\" and could do things in this department that astonished even the great Eugen Sandow, who himself was an expert in the art. For many years, Maxick made his home in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he conducted a gymnasium and health studio. He also went periodically on exploring expeditions into the Matto Grosso of Brazil. Maxick died in Buenos Aires about 1960.", "related": ["B00CISVM18"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Undeterred, he then entered the pole vault and nabbed eighteenth place in that event. With nothing else to prove he immediately retired from college sports. Twenty years after failing high school algebra, he earned a BS in electrical engineering from the University of Texas. Rich works as an engineering manager at Nokia Mobile Phones, which for many years has helped him live his dream of seeing the world. In 2007, he scaled back his business travel and created a program within Nokia which has, to date, provided technical jobs for over forty ambitious college students. He’s helping his oldest daughter, Lindsay, through college and teaching his younger daughter, Leanna, how to pole vault and solve math problems.

Ito presents new insights into how it accomplishes these tasks. He explains how the cerebellum assembles numerous neuronal machine modules, each providing implicit learning capabilities—and how these modules enable humans to unconsciously learn motor skills through practice by forming internal models that simulate the control system properties of body parts. Ito shows how the cerebellum also serves higher brain functions, including implicit components of thought and cognitive processes that manipulate knowledge. In particular, he discusses evidence of the cerebellum’s role in complex mental actions—such as intuition, imagination, hallucination, and delusion—and in supporting the implicit self. Ito’s insights will be valuable to a wide audience of neuroscientific investigators and might also be applicable in artificial intelligence, control engineering, robotics, and related fields.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Don Iago Fernandez barely survives a shipwreck that leaves him a prisoner in a remote area of China. Eventually, he escapes to the Philippines and negotiates passage on the Santa Margarita, a New Spain–bound ship carrying 300 passengers, among them soldiers, priests, prostitutes, merchants, and seamen. As a seafarer with years of experience, Don Iago knows the ship is overcrowded and overloaded, so he’s prepared for problems, but even he can’t predict the 40 typhoons and hurricanes that will batter the boat and force it to spend more than six months covering less than a quarter of its intended journey. Nor can he know that the crew and passengers will suffer tragedy and terrible deprivation, be ravaged by illness, undergo mutiny, and end up shipwrecked on an island populated by violent savages. Woodman perfectly captures the sheer terror and incredible adventure of the Santa Margarita’s voyage and seasons his story with authentic descriptions of the political, social, and religious customs of the time. His incredible enthusiasm for and knowledge of all things maritime plus a riveting plot, taut suspense, and pulse-pounding action add up to a whale of a read. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B00BKWYD5U"], "rank": 3395017, "title": "Disastrous Voyage of the Santa Margarita", "author": "Richard Woodman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The itch to write one has always been there. Like a lot of authors, I've worked at a number of professions over the years, from music publisher and song lyricist to film executive and psychological counselor. I'd always intended to try my hand at a novel someday, perhaps after retirement, but when my daughter was born so was the necessary drive. I figured, why wait? So I began to outline my first Mick Callahan mystery Memorial Day. It was published two years later.Q: How did you get involved in The Dead Man series?HS:In 2010, several experienced authors joined me in forming a loose organization called Top Suspense Group. Among them was Lee Goldberg, who co-created The Dead Man series. Lee asked me if I'd be willing to contribute a novella. Since I grew up on Gold Medal novels, Lancer books and other men's pulp fiction, I loved the concept and jumped at the chance. It was a wonderful experience, and now I'm looking forward to seeing how readers react to my take on Matt's character.Q: You've written a lot of horror books, includingClan,The Hungryand the Lionsgate movie and novelDead and Gone. How is the horror in The Dead Man different from what you have done before?HS:That's an interesting question. For me, horror is not a genre so much as an emotion, so it can be expressed in any number of ways. I generally gravitate towards dry humor coupled with a serious exploration of existential themes--literally the meaning of life, death and those fragile emotional attachments we form along the way. With my entryKill Them All, I wanted to use the horror as a metaphor for moral corruption. I immediately saw Matt as the classic American hero, an archetypal loner wandering into and out of a troubled desert town, standing up to evil on behalf of the weak and downtrodden. I often set novels in Nevada, but to answer your question, this one has the feeling of a graphic novel, and though it's contemporary it is far more of a classic western than anything else I've ever done. It tempts me to try my hand at a period piece.Q: This is the first time you've written in someone else's \"universe.\" What was it like writing characters you didn't create?HS:To be honest, it wasn't easy at first. I'm not used to having to discipline my muse to that degree. Lee Goldberg and William Rabkin were very patient with me, red-lining and sending back a couple of drafts, pointing out where I'd gotten something wrong about Matt's personality or background. The tone had to be just right, and my goofiness had to be reigned in a bit.Kill Them Allended up far, far better as result of their patience. I'll have to prepare and outline more carefully the next time I do a project like this. But once the boundaries were nailed down properly, it just started flowing out. I'm proud of i>Kill Them All. It has substance to it, and was lots of fun to write.Q: What you've written in so many genres. What genre do you like best?HS:Like most of the folks contributing to The Dead Man series, I'm very comfortable wandering the boundary between horror and crime fiction and occasionally blurring the line between the two. And I do love a good western. If forced to choose just one genre, I'd say my heart is in the mystery/thriller, where supernatural elements aren't present, but human evil certainly is. My character Mick Callahan is a troubled young psychologist with anger problems. I work a lot of my own issues out when writing Callahan books. There are plenty of horrific moments in his life, though none involving zombies or ghosts. I enjoy exploring Callahan's inner world.Q: Is there a common strain that runs through your writing regardless of whatever genre you're writing in?HS:Another interesting question. The short answer is yes. Doing the right thing. I am drawn to stories that use temptation and terror to force a protagonist to examine his or her own character. My favorite definition of the word integrity is \"obedience to the unenforceable.\" Okay, you could get away with doing this, but could you live with it? I also believe the old saw \"all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for a good man to do nothing.\" I'm always working to understand my own conflicting impulses and drives, and believe that very human struggle to be a noble endeavor. I'm sure all that comes out in my writing, book after book, and that it's also there inKill Them All.Q: What are you working on now?HS:I'm hard at work on a new Mick Callahan thriller, tentatively entitledRough Men. I'm also toying with a crime novella for Top Suspense Group, and a sequel to my zombie apocalypse novelThe Hungry. So there you go, I'm writing a mystery, a thriller, and a horror novel!", "related": ["B007XVLCO2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.2308, "rating_total": 55.0}

His first few years were spent in the small town of Pernis. After that his parents bought a small piece of land ten miles east of Rotterdam, just outside a village called Berkenwoude. His father was an architect with the architectural firm Van Den Broek en Bakema.  Often his grandfather and grandmother would come over from Germany. Grandmother would always bring homemade cookies and Grandfather would tell exciting stories about the Second World War. He was an SS officer and had fought in Finland against the Russians. He was wounded seriously by a grenade and was transported in a military ambulance back to a military hospital. The next day his entire squadron was destroyed by the Russians. His wounds from the day before had become his survival and enabled Arne’s birth! On the days that Arne’s parents were too busy at work, or the days that they would go on vacation together, Arne was dropped off and picked up at his grandparent’s house in Germany. He would always return home spoiled. Because there was not much money in the family, the kitchen cabinets were just crates put on top of each other. There were no bedroom doors, only large curtains separating those rooms from the living room. There were always efforts made to save money on the electric bill, and if that day the boiler was empty, no one got a bath. Often the bath was shared by the entire family. Father would go first, followed by mother, and then the children. Growing up in the 1960s was an exciting time. His father as well as his mother were enthusiastic glider pilots and during the weekends and vacations, his parents would usually be on the glider field in Terlet. As a little boy Arne helped the landing and departing gliders. Arne went to the Rotterdamse Vrje school and was a child who always dreamed of adventure.  Arne chose not to finish his schooling and was convinced that he would succeed without diplomas. He received an enormous amount of public attention after the attacks of 9/11. He had educated one of the hijackers and controversy erupted surrounding his relationship with Ziad Jarrah. After these events, Arne was encouraged by several publishers to tell his story. Arne, who had contributed to numerous documentaries, including works by Zembla, Al Jazeera, the Discovery Channel, the History Channel, National Geographic, and several other networks, became, in one hit, famous—for the wrong reasons, as Arne says himself.", "related": [], "rank": 3095294, "title": "Unbelievable! eBook", "author": "Arne Kruithof", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He taught that there is only one God, that all the world's religions represent one changeless and eternal Faith of God, and that all humanity is one race, destined to live in peace and harmony.Abdu'l-Baha, meaning Servant of the Glory, was the title assumed by Abbas Effendi (1844-1921)--the eldest son and appointed successor of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet and Founder of the Baha'i Faith. A prisoner since the age of nine, Abdu'l-Baha shared a lifetime of imprisonment and exile with his father at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.

This novella starts off with The Deadening. Bart is a greedy morgue attendant that steals from the dead and receives a worthy punishment for his act. In the second story, The Substitute, fake medium Stan Malcovich is happily cheating people through phony channeling sessions, but his meeting with a woman named Joanna Stark is about to change that. Scorned is a story about Troy and Jenna. After seven years of marriage, the seemingly heroic Troy becomes abusive, but Jenna has a secret way to get even with him.Simply put, it is excellent. Hellbound is effortlessly engrossing and enjoyable; a well-written horror fiction set around a hellish theme. The prose is strong and straightforward at the same time. All the main characters in each story are well-fleshed out. Halfwerk does not rely on the gore technique for her story. All of them are more psychological, which is the main strength of Hellbound as a whole. The clear lesson here is that karma should be taken seriously. In a way, these stories are also about the degradation of morals and ethics in society.I'm sure that fans will be delighted to know that one of the most terrifying beings in the genre, Lilith, also appears in one of the stories. All in all, a quick, gripping, and compulsive read from Su Halfwerk. As a fan of the horror genre, I'm very satisfied and hope that my fellow readers with the insatiable hunger for great, dark, twisted stories won't miss this one.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

Alfred Hitchcock adapted his most famous book 'The Thirty-Nine Steps', featuring Hannay, for the big screen. Born in 1875 in Perth, Buchan was the son of a minister.  Childhood holidays were spent in the Borders, for which he had a great love.  He was educated at Glasgow University and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was President of the Union. Called to the Bar in 1901, he became Lord Milner's assistant private secretary in South Africa.  By 1907, however, he was working as a publisher with Nelson's. During the First World War Buchan was a correspondent at the Front for 'The Times', as well as being an officer in the Intelligence Corps and advisor to the War Cabinet.  Elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for one of the Scottish Universities' seats in 1927, he was created Baron Tweedsmuir in 1935.  From then until his death in 1940 he served as Governor General of Canada, during which time he neverthelss managed to continue writing.", "related": ["B0075C0N58"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lina, the illegitimate daughter of Lord Elham of Kent's Bossingham Hall, regards her mentor, gay antiques dealer Griffith Griff Trip, as her real father. Lina agrees to help Lady Petronella Cordingly, Griff's boyfriend's sister, by bringing a 17th-century Hungarian silver dish of Lord Elham's to sell at an antiques fair Petronella's involved with. At the fair, Detective Sergeant Morris accuses Lina of trying to sell stolen property. Though she's cleared after striking up a friendship with Morris and Piers Hamlyn, a sympathetic young antiques dealer, Lina worries about dodgy doings at Bossingham Hall. Could boozy Lord Elham be stealing from the hall's trustees, or is his son, Darren Harris, the culprit? When the smitten Piers gives Lina a flawed friendship ring, Lina must re-evaluate everything she thinks she knows in this romantic cozy.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We also served our\ndelicious venison to friends and family. The game that I took and the\nfish that we caught helped not only feed us and drastically reduce our\ngrocery bill, but also helped to feed quite a few other families in the\nmarried students' apartments where we lived. Venison was the\nmost-abundant meat that we had at that time because the State of Alabama\n was severely overpopulated with whitetails. Because we had an abundance\n of venison, my wife Denise, who also liked to hunt, became very skilled\n at preparing it many-different ways, so that it never became boring.Question:\n I understand that for you and your wife, developing these recipes was\nimportant many years ago. But why is a venison cookbook so important\ntoday?Phillips: Obesity, heart trouble and cholesterol problems are\nsome of the top medical problems in the United States, and venison is\nthe leanest, most cholesterol-free meat you can eat. Also, people in\nthis country are becoming more concerned about the additives and\nantibiotics being put into feed for cattle, chicken and swine. There's\nnot a more-organic meat or a more all-natural meat than venison or other\n wild animals that feed off the bounty of the forest, so this book is\nmore timely now than when we first wrote it. Too, we tell how to prepare\n ground venison and ground venison sausage, since many hunters find it\neasier to prepare. The second question I'm asked most often, besides how\n to prepare venison, is, \"What do you serve with venison?\" That's the\nreason we have the sections on appetizers, salads and soups, breads,\nvegetables and desserts.Question: Which of these recipes do you like the best?Phillips:\n There's not one of these recipes that I don't like. If I hadn't eaten\nvenison and vegetables and the other dishes that are in this cookbook, I\n wouldn't have put them in the cookbook. But I can honestly say that my\nwife is so creative with foods, and I've met so-many different hunters\nwho have showed me their secrets to making delicious meals, that I enjoy\n every one.", "related": [], "rank": 1670130, "title": "Deer & Fixings: How to Cook Delicious Venison", "author": "John E.

I wondered how they felt: angry or depressed? I\nwas certain they would be socially marginalized; even they had done nothing\nwrong.That idea mushroomed into something bigger: the fight for fairness. Eventually,\nI called my manager and told her that I was going to write something very\ndifferent; that it might compromise sales as my readers, who are used to my\nromance or family novels, might not be comfortable with the subject matter. My\nmanager said, \"You're the author. You're calling me to inform, not to seek for\npermission.\" That made sense; I think I have a great idea, I like to write it\nand I don't care about sales. So I wrote it. As expected, even after so many\nyears, the sales of this book is not as good as my other books.Nevertheless, I did not regret, for the effort I have put into this book is\nintense. While writing the book, I was serving my two-year mandatory national\nservice as a soldier (every male Singaporean has to go through it), and as in\nany organization, there is unfairness. I remember all the emotions and\ndissociate into an angry man, just so to reduplicate the emotions in the story.The result is Lilith--the story about two people who desire to be hunters. Both\nseek to end something; both are angry; both are obsessed with their goals. This\nis so different from my other books that some of my readers, upon buying it,\ngive it to their friends. They still prefer my other books.However, I still believe this is one of my better books; not in terms of sales,\nbut in terms of my personal preference.", "related": ["B004TP9ZH6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Virgin cleansing, a practice engaged in and even recommended before, during and after the Regency Period for the cure of sexually transmitted diseases, continues in practice today.  This myth is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  Reports of rape in some countries may be as many as two a minute.  While not all reported rapes are children, the horrendous belief that virgins will cure HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, which is epidemic in these countries, continues to this date. It seems unimaginable in this age of Twitter revolutions, wireless network advertising that offers consumers 20 seconds faster information, and twenty years of the internet, that such primitive, erroneous, and deadly beliefs continue to plague women and girls.  Much information is available on-line regarding the statistics, both by nation and global efforts.

In 1984 he returned to Italy to participate in the newly established 911 emergency system. After twenty-five years of medical practice on two continents, and with the regrettable certainty that patient care has taken a back seat to bureaucracy, in 1995 he accepted a position with the United States Public Health Service and was a director of a Navajo clinic on their reservation in northeastern Arizona. He was also director of the clinic's Emergency Medical Services and a director of the National Native American Emergency Medical Services Association.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's very promising and engagingly written.We\nstart with Grenel O'Doone, innkeeper of the Ivy Rose, an old soldier who\n always wanted to settle down after his service in the wars that founded\n the Three Kingdoms ended. Now that he has . . . life is a little\nboring. At least until the tall, brawny stranger wrapped in animal skins\n shows up one evening and asks for Lyndy, a local girl trying to raise a\n baby on her own. When the stranger turns out to be Sandaron Sleag--the\nlegendary Sleag the Slayer--one of O'Doone's problems is over. His life\nisn't going to be boring from here on out.As it develops,\nthere's a wizard king, Lorehawk, who is extremely interested in Lyndy\nand her son. And Lyndy isn't exactly the ordinary village girl O'Doone\nassumed she was. And when a menacing stranger shows up . . . O'Doone is\nlong in the tooth, and he's many years and many pounds from the\nbattlefield, but his blood begins to stir.There's a sense of\nreality here that grounds the fantasy elements, and the characters\nreally seem to have lives of their own. Touches of humor, touches of\nadventure, touches of romance, the book has everything a fantasy needs. I\n think you'll be reminded of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, in a good way.\nMy only complaint? This short novel only whets the appetite. Let's have\nmore of Sleag and company, soon, please, Mr. Hayes!", "related": ["B008QZAACO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He graduated in 1967 with a double major in social sciences, and two weeks later his local draft board landed him a job with the U.S. Army.  Jack trained as a MP and served five months at the Underground Pentagon headquarters in western Maryland.  In early 1968, following the Tet Offensive, Jack’s entire unit was shipped to Vietnam.  There his college education finally paid off.  He was offered the job of battalion reporter/photographer.  In short time, Jack’s stories and photos were being published in both the military and civilian press, in-country and across the U.S.  He developed a specialty reporting on the MP sentry dogs and travelled extensively throughout Vietnam to cover his news stories. In the spring of 1969, Jack separated from the Army with the rank of E-5 and returned to the University of Montana to pursue a graduate degree under the GI Bill.  He obtained a Masters of Urban Studies in 1971 and moved to New York City where he worked as a technical writer in the advertising research business.  A year and a half later the call of open spaces took him to Victoria, British Columbia, where he established a weekly newspaper devoted to outdoor recreation and environmental issues. When the paper folded in 1975, Jack returned to Montana and settled into a career job as a counselor with state government.  During that time, for a creative release, he began writing fiction and continued doing so almost up to his early retirement in 1995.  Jack again went back into business, this time as a wholesale distributor of Montana specialty jewelry he manufactures.  He is married to a talented artist, Ellen Leidl, and has three dogs he calls his family.  His obsession is pheasant hunting, and he enjoys fishing and rock hounding in what little spare time he has.", "related": [], "rank": 3097134, "title": "The President's Mistress", "author": "Jack Paskvan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brown shines a bright light on all the nonsensical ideas and arguments that have been peddled by Fed myth makers - both past and present. He scrutinizes and explodes ideas embraced by contemporary currency warriors, including the so-called global imbalance and savings glut problems, and, yes, inflation targeting. Once Brown disrobes the oracles, he then takes monetarism to a new level and unfurls a blueprint for monetary stability.\" - Steve H.

A manual that was exciting, clear to follow, had examples and was used by a professional who gave just the right amount of technical info with explanations of why you use those settings, when to use those settings and so on, all properly explained. The book is a revelation, a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. Nikon should be employing Doug to write every one of their cameras manuals.-R.D.C.For beginners and the more experienced- This book, with its fun to read and easy to understand instructions, helps both the novice and experienced. It isn't a rehash of the Nikon manual, but explains what each camera function is for and how you might want to set it to achieve your goal. My photos have improved after reading this book, and I refer to it again as I learn more. It offers an abundance of information and it is too much for me to take in all at one time. I highly recommend this purchase. It is worth every penny and more.-Laura A.It's the first guide I've read which has taken me through all the settings in an understandable way. I now feel that I have control over the camera.-Peter S.Really practical and tremendously helpful.Readers of this e-book can expect to benefit from a more rewarding photographic experience using this superb camera, and be better able to exploit its potential to match their personal objectives and photographic style. Highly recommended.-M.M.Really focuses on the \"why\"- I found the Nikon manual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why - this book really focuses on the WHY.  The guide helped me understand why to use specific settings for specific needs.  The Custom Settings sections help to make firm decisions on how to apply settings by understanding the usage of each in addition to knowing how to set them up.-Benoit A.It's clear, concise and gets to the heartof the camera's multiple and often confusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and beginner alike. As previous reviewers have remarked, the official manual is very good on what to do, but not so clear on why.-G.S.A.All you need- This book, together with the manual that came with your camera, is all you need to start discovering the full potential of the camera.-Max M.This manual is a clearly written, concise and usefulexplanation of the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing settings options for the camera. Used in conjunction with the Nikon manual I feel more confident in understanding how to at last proceed in getting better photographs.-W.L.S.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a quick start to using their Nikon.  Manuals are nice, but this eBook highlights the important information and gives a quick, easy to understand explanation of most all of the functions and controls.-Ray M.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He meets another potential alpha--Jax. There is an immediate attraction on several levels that will lead Dallas back into the complexity of the Pack Politics he was trying to escape. Suddenly Dallas finds himself a witness as Jax isChallengedby his brother for the position of Pack Leader. Jax would prefer to walk away--will his homophobic Pack  accept the first openly gay alpha? Especially when Dallas is standing beside him? (An adults only gay erotic romance that includes Kindle melting graphically explicit sexual encounters between alpha werewolves. This over 14,000 word story includes theTale of Dallas and Jaxthat first appeared inSupernatural Sex and the City, along with all new material.)Excerpt:\"I'm Jeffery St. Claire,\" a deep voice said from behind me. If I hadn't been so focused on Jax, he couldn't have sneaked up on me. This was a potentially dangerous and very unknown place. I couldn't afford to get careless. He stepped in front of me and offered me his hand. When I shook it, I felt the unmistakable tingle of theevne, the supernatural energy that makes us who and what we are. I wondered if he were doing it on purpose, or if he were just so powerful it just constantly dripped out of him. He gave me that look I knew so well--\"When can we do it?\" Nice to know I still had it. \"How long have you known Jax?\" I asked. I wasn't going to run off and bang him at a funeral. That would be even more tacky than the best man fucking the bride right before the wedding. As Bette Midler once said, \"I have my standards. They may be low, but I have them.\" I'll admit I was tempted. I knew from direct experience with my werebear, someone who was able to focus his evne could kick up sex into the stratosphere. But to my own surprise, I really wondered about Jax and what it would be like to actually be his formal mate. God, who do I think I am? Sadie, Sadie, married lady? Like I was ever known as Mr. Monogamous. I mean, I had once been called an incubus slamming Viagra.\"Since we were kids. Our fathers were allies, so you know how those things go. Your family is required to alternate an occasional weekend at your ally's home. If you have more than one child, then the kid is sent over as a potential hostage and then he gets returned to show how much of an ally you really are.\" He looked over at Jax who was still busy with his funeral duties. \"But our fathers were close on all levels--just like Jax and I were.\" He looked back at me just to make sure I heard \"with benefits\" was the unspoken tag line. Sure, like father like sons. Jacob had probably been envious of Jeffery as well. He got to watch Jax go spend fun weekends with Jeffery. I bet I know who his first boyfriend was. How convenient.Wait--what the hell? Instead of thinking about what it would be like to have a fun weekend of my own with Jefferey I was actually feeling a tickle of jealousy he was Jax's childhood cherry popper? What was wrong with me? Maybe I was suffering from PTSD after the ripping the head off thing.", "related": ["B00FZZQEK0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this book she shows how the education bureaucracy will go to any lengths to keep the federal money flowing, even if its effects are destructive, and keep Hispanic children in a condition that deprives them of their independence but always in need of more government assistance. She further shows how useless and even destructive bilingual education methods can be. This is a must read for anyone who cares whether Hispanic kids ever learn to speak English.(Roy Miller, Business Consultant and Co-Founder of the Goldwater Institute)Johanna Haver provides a lively history of one of the most politically sensitive arenas in public policy: bilingual education. The early promise of this new way to educate non-English speaking children, its failures, the educators, politicians, ethnic activists—it’s all here and it’s not a pretty story. At the end, an inspiring view of improvements made, challenges yet to be met. My hat’s off to Johanna.(Rosalie Pedalino Porter, Ed.D, author of \"American Immigrant:  My Life in Three Languages\" and \"Forked Tongue\")English for the Childrenhas brought forward the ups and downs of the political and educational systems regarding the education of English language learners. It discusses positive actions, challenges, and the direction needed to move in order to get these children ready for the 21stCentury.(Norma Basolet, director of federal programs/ELL, Yuma Elementary School District One, Yuma, Arizona)Johanna Haver describes the movement to dislodge bilingual education as the default method for teaching English to ELL students, from Ron Unz’s English for the Children campaign in California through the establishment of the structured English immersion model in Arizona. Haver describes the political roadblocks that California, Massachusetts, Colorado, and her state, Arizona encountered on the way to reform, as well as problems that have yet to be solved.(Jerry Jesness, Teacher and Consultant, Author of \"Teaching English Language Learners K-12\" and \"Standing and Delivering\")Johanna Haver’s bookEnglish for the Childrenshould be required reading for all who profess to have the interests of English learners at heart. At a time when our education system is challenged to help newcomers become fully participating members of American life, the history of the misguided efforts to teach children in their native languages couldn’t be more timely. Haver demonstrates in full detail why delaying English acquisition harms the very children the system is supposed to help.(Linda Chavez, president, Becoming American Institute)", "related": [], "rank": 2523658, "title": "English for the Children", "author": "Johanna J.

In fact, some of the people that he grew up with are characters portrayed in theUnderbellyTV series.At the age of 22, Justin was not only suicidal, but found himself heading down the path towards murder. He realised that the destructive life he had been living for so many years was only headed towards death, and he called out to Jesus to save him. His life took a massive turn and today, Justin is the senior pastor of Destiny Centre Christian church in Hoppers Crossing, Victoria.  Justin has an insatiable love for God’s word. His passion to see people grasp and apply God’s principles and promises clearly comes through in his razor-sharp yet humorous speaking ability. Justin’s focus never fades from his two-fold mission to see ‘the lost found and the found crowned’. He loves to help people become all that God created them to be and for them to live an abundant life that will bless and impact other people’s lives.Justin travels nationally and internationally, preaching to build and inspire the body of Christ. He has been happily married to his wife Kim since 1999 and has two sons, Davis and Oskar, whom he adores.", "related": [], "rank": 3104348, "title": "CrimeSon eBook", "author": "Justin Gardner", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Talvez por essa formação dialética, tem com seus pacientes uma abordagem terapêutica inovadora. Escreveu cinco livros e foi fundadora da extinta Pensão Margaridas, clinica dinâmica de tratamento de pacientes internados ou semi-internados. Foi Professora Titular da Cadeira de Psiquiatria em Vassouras, e chefe e supervisora da 1ª clínica de Tratamento Dinâmico, RJ na década de 1970, a chamada Vila Pinheiros.

As an extravagant lover and worshipper of God, Brenda spent three years in her upper room with the Lord as she navigated the joys and struggles of her wilderness experience. Out of this experience, she learned to rest in the Lord, all the while writing down her dialogues with Him, bringing the simple act of \"soaking in His presence\" to a whole new level. Brenda believes sharing her intimate journey with the Lord as she discovered the beauty of Father's love under the guidance of Holy Spirit will transform and change lives, as hers was changed.

Although too wide in the shoulders and too tight in the waist, the suit makes Frankl feel attractive and powerful, and he begins to work out in a gym to mold his body to the garment's dimensions. As his body fills the suit, Frankl becomes more and more like the brutal Bouchette. And, like Bouchette, Frankl is going down a slippery slope to self-destruction.

However, the ebook is a clever parody of Catholic rites,it is sexy and fun. But after a while the action becomes repetitive and mechanical. The young priest is very generous with his favours, and serves all and sundry (a commendable ecumenical attitude!).The sad truth is that some of these activities have occurred in real life, and in a non consenual fashion- something that the Vatican needs to come to terms with...So this ebook can be seen as entertainment on one level, but a serious attack on the Church as well... .  stephen howe", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On that same farm she once owned thirty-three gerbils and eighteen cats, not a good mix, as it turns out. Teyla always had her nose in a book and daydreamed about someday creating her own worlds. She is now married, mostly grown up, and has seven kids, including a two-year-old, so life at her house can be very interesting (and loud), but writing keeps her sane. She thrives on the energy, inspiration, and daily amusement offered by her children. Grabbing any snatch of free time from her hectic life, Teyla writes novels, often with a child on her lap. She loves guns, martial arts, and belly dancing. Teyla writes urban fantasy, paranormal romance, and science fiction. She also writes romance and romantic suspense under the name Rachel Branton.

Maybe we lost our minds a bit; but we’re happy we did. I am retired from the US Navy as well as a retired manufacturing Quality Manager. Kathy has worked extensively in the medical administrative field. We had travelled worldwide due to my naval service as well as locations on both coasts of our beautiful country. We would see the big bus conversions and Winnebago RV’s on the interstates and we both said, “one day that will be us”. We started dreaming in earnest in 2003, a year before my job was out sourced. We went to shows and visited dealerships just to see if we could really do this. We could. We took the plunge two years later after we sold our house in Florida and bought “The Dream Machine”, our 2004 Fleetwood Expedition diesel motor home. Since then we have travelled through the states we used to fly over and discovered a unique and awesomely beautiful land that pictures do not give justice to. We have been volunteers, workampers, podcasters, and now authors. I hope you enjoy our book; and if you see us on the road, honk and wave. Visit our website at: http://www.livingthervdream.com .

My work as a journalist, grant writer and fundraising executive requires me to write compelling prose under word count and available space constraints. The novelist within screams “Let me out!” Most Sunday afternoons and rare weekday evenings over two years, I ignored the disciplines of the technical writer and let the author have her way.  Darien, the dashing chef driven by the pursuit of culinary perfection and hungry for a life-long partner in love. Ali, successful and settled but alone and wary of trusting a lover with her heart.  Their separate worlds on either side of the East River – family and friends, fears and doubts, hopes and joys – converged in my imagination and compelled me to describe what they saw and write the words they spoke. My fascination with fiction began as soon as I could read.  Piles of hardcover and paperback novels, mysteries, science fiction and fantasy and Shakespearean plays checked out from the local library entertained me through childhood and adolescence.  I remember trying to write my first novel with a pencil on lined paper at about age eight.  My second serious attempt many years later resulted in the first draft of a science fiction and fantasy story that I hope to flesh out, polish up and publish in the not too distant future. In many ways, my love life mirrored Ali’s.  Divorced and doubtful that I would ever find the love of my life, I answered an online post from a man in Toronto, Ontario looking to share “a newspaper in the morning and a glass of wine at night.” He responded. We chatted online, ran up ridiculous long distance phone bills and even bigger credit card balances for round-trip airfares between Iowa and Canada before he proposed and I accepted. The improbability of the story we’re still writing together inspired my romance muse.  Happily-ever-after happens in fiction and real life.", "related": ["B00IQXRKIS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
