Dylan Fontaine, the 15-year-old narrator, lives in chaos: his mother has moved out to live with Dylan's art teacher; his older brother, Randy, gets stoned all the time and might drop out of school to tour with his band, The Dead Musicians Society; his father, an obstetrician, is never around, making their Brooklyn house the 24-hour gathering place for the band and, maybe, a spot to stash drugs. Dylan also struggles with girls-the one he wishes were his girlfriend has tapped her ex-boyfriend to help her shoot a documentary about Dylan, and the one in the band flirts with both Dylan and his brother. By the time Dylan steps out of the little brother/sidekick role to take center stage in his own life, the author wraps up remaining conflicts so tidily that she seems to cheat (Why would the boys have thought their mother had left for another man?

Ace, who is much too old for for those shorts, is standing on tip-toe, gluteus muscles all tensed and round, with his tongue extended ready to lick something, well, someone, I guess J. I found this schoolboy sexed-up posture a bit creepy. I can't figure if it's an attempt at sensuality that failed or the mangaka finds the tawdry and coarse as sexy, mistaking the queasy feeling for erotic experience. Another unpleasant drawing is included as an extra - it's J in a stereotypical vampire pose: standing perfectly erect (no, not that way!), arms extended to allow his cape to fall to his side, face en profile. We've seen this pose a thousand times, but instead of the traditional, over-starched white shirt, J is wearing a see through shirt, all the better to see his highly erect nipples. This is even creepier than the cover. The print quality is good, the artwork does not provide any particular challenge for it.After the first read-through I had intended to give this a much lower grade, but when it came right down to it, I realized that I did want to read more. There is something here, even though I might be loathe to define it, and recognition of that is deserving of a higher grade than I had intended.My initial problem was with Ace. I felt he was a disruption from the more compelling story of King and J. (Jack? Joker? Yes, I get it, but is there a point?) For much of the book, it's the juvenile Ace that we see interacting with King and J. While this interplay is important in defining the relationships, the more adult exchanges of lovers King and J, defined by the vampire world that Sadahiro imposes on them, are really more fascinating. I have come to realize what Ace means for the future of the story, he just seems to be a bit of a drag here.Sadahiro makes it quite clear that the mortal avenues of sexual gratification means nothing to her vampires. They are numb to anything below the waist. However, this doesn't mean that they don't use the sexual desires of mortal humans to attain their own satisfaction. I was charmed and delighted (very euphemistically) by the threesome composed of King, J and a bar pickup, and how each individual got gratification in a way meaningful to him. Mika Sadahiro can be very surprising, direct and sexy, and she pulls these off in this scene. At a time when so much BL is for me a case of \"same ass, different tatami mat\", this inventiveness is a welcome surprise. --ManiaIt must be vampire month at DMP. First it's Necratoholic by Meguro Wasabi, then it's Red Angel vol. 1 by Makoto Tateno, finally Pathos vol. 1 by Mika Sadahiro. Pathos is the tale of two vampires who adopt a human boy.King is a caring and kind older brother. J is a mondo jerk. Ace is our main man who is human, but desires to become a vampire to be closer to J. Initially J tries to avoid Ace by being unkind, but you can tell that there are some emotions boiling right under the surface. Because J has a major desire to drain Ace of his life force King decides to send Ace to boarding school in Boston. To seal Ace's fate, the day before he leaves for America J partakes of Ace's blood.While Ace is at school he finds himself using Dracula by Bram Stoker as a means to help him pleasure himself. His roommate Rand decides to seduce Ace. By the time he turns eighteen Ace has made up his mind to become a full vampire.We also learn how J becomes a vampire and how he tries to exact his revenge on his captor.This is an interesting read. The very first page has some pretty steamy sex. When it starts off so randy like this you never know if it just going to be sex, and more sex, and lacking in story or it might just be a great read. I'm not a huge fan of vampire stories but this one surprised me. It was gripping and now I am anxious to get my hands on the second volume. Mika Sadahiro-sensei has an interesting art style. You are able to tell the characters apart from one another and even thought the eyes aren't as detailed as other mangaka they are still expressive. My only issue is with King's hair. He has a Robert Plant (Led Zepplin)/Roger Daltry (The Who) vibe going on. It's a little creepy. This is of course a high quality release from Juné. It's a larger trim size, is very flexible, and has a beautiful dust jacket. The copy that I have is a matte finish on the dust jacket as opposed to the glossy finish that they usually do. I prefer the matte finish better, but that's just me. I say check it out, it's worth the time and money. And for someone who doesn't really like the vampire thing to say that you ought to read it, it must be somewhat worthwhile! --Manic About MangaPathos is the story of a unique family of three. After his parents are killed, Ace is taken in by their killers and raised as their younger brother. The two, King and J, are vampires, and it's a lifestyle they're unable to hide from the perceptive Ace, especially when the boy's affections for J soon become anything but innocent.Best known for her gritty prison story, Under Grand Hotel (not licensed for English publication), Mika Sadahiro shouldn't disappoint her fans who re looking for a dark and twisted story of passion. Ace is the main focus of the story, initially at least, and readers are shown out-of-order glimpses of his life from child to teen. His insecurities of not being blood related to King and J are pushed aside by hormones and a raging vampire fetish, all aimed at his much older brother , J. Meanwhile, J, as a vampire, who can't feel anything such as sexual acts as humans can, finds pleasure with King as they exchange blood during bouts of passionate feeding. Against his better judgement, J finds himself unnervingly drawn to the taste of Ace's blood, which puts at risk their little family's already strange dynamics, not to mention Ace's life.I really loved reading this first volume of Pathos. It felt refreshing having something that's just so different from the usual boys love you ll find in English out there. Honestly, though there weren't that many sex scenes (unless you count the in-for-sex neck sucking sessions), the overall sexual themes made this feel like a series I could more likely see handled by DMP's imprint, 801Media, as opposed to June which, despite a few exceptions like these, I generally associate with the lighter kind of stories.My one qualm with the story would be the slightly confusing set-up of the chapters, which hop around from present, past and future. So make sure to keep careful eye on the scenarios, and their relevance to others, to see how everything orders in the end. The back and forth timeline hopping did prove a lot of interesting and character-development peeks at relevant events, however, including a lengthy look at the life of King and J before Ace came into their undead lives.Mika Sadahiro's art style also brings a level of uniqueness to the book, with a retro feeling, bolstered by the occasional eighties-style fashion sense, and attractive metro sexual men who still look very much like men. The character's eyes, and their intense gazes, often speak as much as their blood-dripped lips, which creeped me out sometimes, but in a way that was ultimately complimenting to the whole thing. I also loved the cover illustration, which, combined with DMP's lovely print quality of the cover slip, makes for a very attractive first impression.Overall, the sullen tone and dark eroticism of this series made for an intriguing read. I really loved how different it felt compared to the often cookie-cutter styling of boys love stories and I highly recommend Pathos to those who want something a little dark and different. As Ace eagerly awaits his eighteenth birthday for the chance to join his brothers as a vampire, I eagerly look forward to seeing where this twisted trio ups in volume two. --Kuriosity", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The almost anonymous narrator, a basically dry-as- dust denizen of Whitehall, is charged with investigating the mysterious demise of a colleague, Stephen Summerchild, who had fallen to his death from high in the Admiralty offices years before. Bit by bit, through old files, photographs and a cache of uproarious tapes, he pieces together the strangest romance: that of Summerchild and a Russian-born Oxford philosophy don who had been summoned, in a moment of government madness, to investigate the nature of happiness. Amid much beautifully spoofed academic chatter, the two find a profound attraction and create a literal love nest in a tiny room high under the government eaves. Meanwhile the narrator so enters into their ridiculous but poignant relationship that he almost, but not quite, breaks loose of his own fusty ways; and he does learn why Summerchild fell. Frayn writes with great wit, a haunting sense of the atmosphere and texture of quiet London lives and places, and a profound knowledge of the official heart. This is a masterly comic performance with a hint of rue.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Impregnated at 16 by a well-respected womanizer twice her age, Victoire was treated like a criminal, beaten by her father and run off from her home. After fleeing her shame, Victoire is taken on as a servant by a white Creole family, where she spent most of her life; there, her talent for cooking brings her the attention, admiration and business of prominent white Creoles. Condé proves just as impressive in her own medium: a tall man is long as a day without bread; the sea on a hot day shines like a gold bar being smelted. Deceptively slim, Condé's 15th title is a savory, complex mix of Caribbean culture, black history and the lives of ordinary women.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I have a confession to make. I hate “Phone Game.” I used to think it was a necessary evil – if you don’t take a woman home the same night you meet her, you have to phone her and get her out on a date. Admittedly, I got pretty good at it anyway. The best in the world, if you believe what people write about me. And then Braddock came along. Braddock is a guy who couldn’t get a date a few years ago, until he found Love Systems. In his words, “I read every Love Systems book. I listened to every audio. I soaked up all the knowledge I could, and I practiced. A lot.” It paid off. He became so successful with beautiful women that he got ranked among the top 10 pick up artists in the world. He was invited to join Love Systems as an instructor – an elite honor for the world’s top pick up artists only. Braddock saw that the game was changing, so he spent a year and a half recording, studying, and testing thousands of phone calls and text (sms) conversations. He’s found the “glitches in the matrix.” He’s used all the shortcuts. In short, he’s proven that what used to be an annoying necessity can actually be an amazingly powerful tool to pick up beautiful women – all building on the internationally successful Love Systems approach to picking up women.", "related": ["B00A6YP1RC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What did I like? - the combination of case stories and personal experience and insight combined with NLP, druidism and quotes. The dashboard is a really great tool and I'm still working my way through it. Well done you, I really felt it gave a huge sense of possibility - i.e. start with X and then who knows.... which is so lovely and uplifting for the reader. and for me (and I'm sure many of those who will read it) it was also a call to action ...About time I faced up to and broke my relationship patterns. yep, here goes....! --A pre-published version review from www.learntoloveandbelovedinreturn.comThe Dashboard for Success(one of the book's 'Seven Tools for Living Day to Day Life More Wisely') .... is a tool that really adds value.....because it's based on Dr Burr's deep comprehension of modelling and assessing people, surfaced in frameworks that are practical and simple to deploy.\" -- A pre-published comment from www.learntoloveandbelovedinreturn.comThis book will help you to get the relationships you want by making you aware of the baggage that holds you in a place where you `know' things should be different but you can't break out.But... be warned this book, as with all other self help tools, is a waste of money!!! Unless, of course, you not only read ALL of it and digest it but most importantly, do the exercises.It has been fascinating to watch Paul, in his inimitable style, testing the concepts in this book by living through a fairly traumatic year and seeing him come out the other side, changed, a better human being who has learnt to be compassionate not just with other people but also with himself. At times, Paul would say he couldn't write but it was only because he hadn't learnt how to solve a problem with a relationship with which he was wrestling. So this book really is rooted in actual, real life experience and will help you short cut your learning curve, if you allow. -- From on of the book's two Forewords...this book has been a pleasure to edit. Most of the time, books on NLP are about the laws of attraction and so on. I love the fact that this book goes beyond that. The content is fascinating and interesting. I learnt much from what was shared. --From the editor of the pre-published version -  www.learntoloveandbelovedinreturn.comDavid Loxley, Chief Druid, The Druid Order, LondonThis book falls into a gap between too simple and too difficult to understand. If it were either, it would fail in its mission. Paul has put all of his experiences together and created something unique. This book is a DIY guide on how to build in the roots that support what kind of relationship you want and how long you want it to last. And be philosophical and learn when it doesn't work out that way.Paul shows us how we can choose freely, to start and sustain a loving relationship, rather than be driven by circumstances to make choices apparently beyond our control. --From one of the two Forewords - www.learntoloveandbelovedinreturn.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

James Taylor, an arrogant, well-off CEO of a consumer electronics company, believes he can have everything he wants, including his ex-girlfriend Sam. A year after she left him (she caught him smooching another woman), James's mother insists on hiring her as a live-in nurse to help her through her cancer treatment. Though Sam tries to keep her distance, James relentlessly and jealously pursues her, demanding she take him back and threatening to beat up the men he sees her with. Even though James's possessiveness is believable, Whittier (The Truth About Being a Bass Fisherman's Wife;Fatal Embrace) fails to make a convincing case for Sam's lingering interest in her reckless and frightening ex-boyfriend.

Welcome to The NAUTICAL MUSE. Your history is similar to mine, \"leaves corporate rat race to become a boat bum.\" Tell us why you decided to become a professional boat captain and how you made the transition? Bob: --- I fell in love with the sea before I could walk. In fact I was born on an island. Granted, it was Manhattan. Anyway, I joined the Sea Cadets when I was a preteen. Took a Chapman Piloting and Seamanship class with my father when I was twelve or thirteen. Became a water skiing instructor while in high school. Then I went to college and afterwards got a job working for a multi-national corporation in NYC. Nothing to do with boats or the sea. But I never could free myself from that magnetic pull; you know the one. My father always had a boat of some kind, and one year we bought one together, a 38' Egg Harbor. Fiberglass hull, all wood topside. Nice sport fish boat. I sat for my first captain's license at the USCG station at Battery Park in Manhattan -- I think it was in 1978 -- and right afterwards bought my own boat and started taking charters on weekends. Two day weekends became four day weekends and then one year there was a big personnel shakeup at the place where I worked. I didn't feel like sticking around so I set up a small company and started planning a change. I located about a dozen shipwrecks and dive sites on the coast of Maine, placed a few adds and started a dive charter business in Penobscot Bay. It virtually happened overnight. One day I was cleaning out my desk on the 29th floor of the Sperry Rand building and the next I was loading my bicycle and all my other belongings onto the deck of my converted lobster boat, casting off lines, and heading for Maine.Doug: What prompted you to become a writer?Bob: --- Lack of work. I always liked to write, but I never thought I would do it for money. Then one day I wrote a story about swimming with humpback whales in Cape Cod Bay. I sent the story to a regional magazine and a few weeks later I got a check in the mail. I thought, hmm, this is cool. I wonder if I can do this again. I did. It got to the point where I was writing for half a dozen magazines, a couple of columns and four to six features every month.Doug: Sounds like you started out writing feature articles and then became a novelist. Tell us about how that all happened.Bob: --- Oh, man. That took some time. Too much time. In between writing features and novels was a 10 year period of screenwriting. My father always wanted me to write a novel, and I tried several times. It just didn't click for me. Not until Calamity. Calamity is my first novel. Doug: My biggest problem as a delivery captain and marine surveyor is my writing keeps getting interrupted by making a living. You have a pretty active life. What kind of writing schedule do you keep?Bob: --- My life changed significantly about eight years ago when my mother got sick and had to be taken care of. Before that I was a full time professional captain, on call 24/7 running a pilot boat and also running my own 47 passenger eco-tour boat. Actually, while I was doing that, I was more disciplined about my writing. Not disciplined in a morning, noon or night way, but making sure I was writing something every day. Afterwards, caring for my mother, is when things got out of control. Now I'm kind of in knee-jerk mode. I'm spending less time on the water and more time ghost writing for other people. Not too happy about that. Got to get back to my own stuff. I have the second in the Grande Angil Mystery series I have to write.Doug: Have you always written fiction?Bob: --- Oh no. I started as a technical marine writer, writing about boats and gear. I also did at-sea stuff. National Fisherman magazine used to send me out on fishing boats to write about different types of fishing. I did boat tests, and boat gear reviews. It wasn't as much fun as it sounds.Doug: I know you have also written a memoir What They Don't Tell You About Alzheimer's. Tell us how that came about.Bob: --- That book came out of me after my mother died of Alzheimer's this past October. After the funeral, I came back to the house and punched it out in about six weeks. It went live on Amazon in January. Not to get spooky-kooky about it, but I think she may have been looking over my shoulder while I was writing it.Doug: What was the first book you published and how does it differ from your Captain Grande Angil mystery series?Bob: --- I had been published in a few reference books, just excerpts. The Alzheimer's book was the first book published. That was in January. I wrote Calamity next and published that in April. I finished Calamity in about eight weeks. The two books are completely different. Calamity is a beach read. It's 345 pages and I've had people tell me they were able to read it in one or two days on the beach. I had one guy tell me he read it on a plane trip from Australia to the U.S. The Alzheimer's book is only 175 pages. Some people can read it in one sitting and others have to read a bit, then put it down and let it sit. It's emotional and very close to home for a lot of people. A movie producer with whom I work told me he had to put it down after twenty pages. His mother passed away two years ago and it was just too difficult for him. So, one book is about a fun, crazy, fantasy adventure and the vicarious thrills that go with it. The other is about an adventure nobody wants to have.Doug: I assume you spend a lot of time on your charter boat and so does your character. How much of you is in your character?Bob: --- I should plead the fifth on this. Let's just say there's a lot more Grande in Grande than Bob. But people who know me will see the similarities.Doug: Tell us about your latest book CALAMITY.Bob: --- Calamity is about a charter boat captain who stretches the truth to get a private detective's license. He puts out a shingle -- Marine Investigations -- and his first job turns out to be way out of his league.Doug: Okay, what's next? Have you got any other writing projects you are working on?Bob: --- I'm working on the next Grande Angil mystery. And we're also still trying to find a home for our TV series.Doug: When can we expect the next Captain Grande Angil mystery and what is it about?Bob: --- It's called Stowaway. A dying mob boss hires Grande to work undercover for a treasure hunting consortium. I don't want to say too much except that it's not about terrorists. My last book was sort of about guilt and redemption. Trying to make something right but going about it the wrong way. This one is about looking for love in all the wrong places. Like the song. Doug: Tell us something about Robert G. Bernstein, that other readers and writers might find interesting.Bob: --- I have a strange fascination with the word 'coincidence' and I love a good thunderstorm. Doug: Any parting thoughts [for other writers of marine fiction]?Bob: --- There isn't enough nautical fiction out there, and what some people peddle as nautical, is actually romance in disguise. Clearly, if you're in this to make money, you'd do best with something titled \"Fifty Shades of Bottom Paint.\" Your main character would be a drug-addicted mermaid with a sexual obsession, and all your nautical references would be double entendres. You know, as in: \"That's some marlinespike you got there.\" Please, please, please, don't think about revenue. Write a great boat story.Doug: Thanks for the interview, Bob. I'm glad we hooked up and I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of CALAMITY!You can learn more about Bob and his writing at the following sites:amazon.com/author/rgbernsteincaptaingrandeangil.com/seabgb.com/", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": 1610266, "title": "Beneath Cold Seas", "author": "Bob Bernstein", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He first started writing in the 1890s and had his first work published in 1903, in \"Shargi-Rus\" (Oriental Russia) a newspaper in Tbilisi, Georgia. In his early publications Ordubadi criticised ignorance, backwardness and religious fanaticism. In 1906 he published his poetry book (Ignorance) and in 1907 (Fatherland and Freedom). He wrote for several Azerbaijani publications, including \"Molla Nasraddin\", \"Irshad\", \"Sada\" and others. Ordubadi covered various political, social and educational issues. He firmly stood for the necessity of the enlightenment of the Azerbaijani society under the Russian rule. In 1911, Ordubadi published a book (Bloody years) - a collection of first-hand accounts of the Armenian-Tatar massacres in 1905-1906, which has now for the first time been translated into English. In 1915, Russian authorities arrested him and exiled to Tsaritsyn. In 1918, he joined the Communist Party and returned to Baku in May 1920, after the Bolshevik conquest of Azerbaijan.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered,The Turn of Screwgenerates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 3.6471, "rating_total": 62.0}

Her hand, swallowed by the doctor's larger one, rioted in unexpected reaction.Dr. J. C. Mueller smiled and she gaped, unable to think of anything coherent to say as he turned to her mother, Lillian.\"So, Mrs. Carter, I understand your G.P. recommended you meet with me.\" He winked. \"Of course, I am the only neurologist in Rosewood.\"Maddie stumbled on her way to the extra chair in the examining room, righting herself quickly, hoping he hadn't noticed.How had she forgotten this man? True, he'd been three years ahead of her in high school, then he'd gone to Baylor, while she'd attended the University of Texas, but still… She couldn't stop staring. Tall, broad–shouldered, with a shock of thick dark hair, mesmerizing brown eyes and a cleft in his chin that begged to be touched.J.C. flipped through the thick pile of pages in her mother's chart, detailing the history of strokes that had brought on early onset dementia. He put down the folder, picking up Lillian's hand, placing two fingers over her upturned wrist.Maddie couldn't still her heartbeat, instantly remembering the strength of his long fingers, the touch that tickled even her toes.\"Mrs. Carter, your vital signs are excellent.\"Pleased, Lillian smiled. \"Thank you, young man.\"\"I'd like to run a few tests, nothing invasive.\"\"Have I met you before?\" Lillian questioned, puzzled.\"I grew up here in Rosewood,\" J.C. responded patiently. His wide smile was easy, kind. And his gold–flecked brown eyes sparkled.Maddie's own pulse increased.Good thing he wasn't recording hers.\"How about you, Mrs. Carter? Are you from Rosewood originally?\"Maddie recognized the pattern to the handsome doctor's questions. He wanted to see if her mother could remember and verbalize her recollections. Lillian's worsening symptoms had prompted their G.P.'s referral to a specialist.\"My mother was born here,\" Lillian mused, her pale blue eyes reflective. \"My father came from the Panhandle, near Amarillo. But he took one look at her and knew he wanted to stay.\" Smiling, she looked up at the doctor. \"Love will do that, you know.\"\"Yes, ma'am,\" J.C. agreed, stretching out his long legs.Immediately, Maddie wondered if he was married, engaged. Surely some smart woman had snagged him long ago.\"So you raised your family here,\" J.C. continued. Lillian's short–term memory was nearly nonexistent, but she remembered quite a bit from the past.\"My Maddie, yes.\"J.C. glanced in Maddie's direction to include her in the conversation. \"Just one child?\"\"One perfect daughter,\" Lillian declared proudly.Maddie felt her cheeks warming and shrugged an embarrassed apology to the doctor.He grinned. \"And why mess with perfection?\"\"That's how we always felt,\" Lillian agreed with a vigorous nod as she turned to stare at her daughter. J.C. mimicked her action.Maddie immediately wished she'd remembered to wear lipstick. And what had she been thinking when she'd chosen this rumpled blouse and skirt?That her mother had let the bath water run unchecked until it overflowed. And Maddie had been zooming on full speed to get the mess cleaned up so that they could get ready for the appointment. Their small home had only one bathroom and Lillian could have easily slipped on the tile floor.Self–consciously, Maddie smoothed her full cotton skirt, remembering she hadn't done a thing with her hair. In fact, she'd pulled it back in a messy ponytail. Just add the braces she'd once worn and she would look as geeky as she had in high school. Trying not to flush more, Maddie smiled feebly beneath their inspection.\"Maddie should have her own tea shop,\" Lillian continued.\"Oh, yes?\"Maddie squirmed. \"Just an old dream.\"\"Nothing of the kind,\" Lillian declared. \"She should set up right on Main Street, smack dab in the middle of town.\"\"Let me know when you're ready,\" J.C. gazed at Maddie. \"I happen to have a building…well, actually it belongs to my young niece. And it desperately needs a tenant. Be a great place for a tea shop.\" Turning back to Lillian, he extended his hand. \"Mrs. Carter, I've enjoyed our visit and I'm looking forward to seeing you more often.\"\"I should think you'd rather visit with my beautiful daughter,\" Lillian guilelessly replied.Lord, a hole, please. Underneath this chair, just big enough for me to disappear.\"I'll see you both on your next visit,\" J.C. replied without missing a beat.Rumpled, crumpled and thoroughly embarrassed, Maddie rose, ready to end their consultation.But the doctor wasn't. This time he spoke directly to her. \"My nurse will set up the tests.\" He held out a paper. \"Just give this to her.\" He scribbled on a second sheet of paper. \"And I want to adjust your mother's medications.\"\"Thank…\" Maddie cleared the embarrassing croaking in her voice. \"Thank you.\"\"My pleasure.\"She sincerely doubted that, but smiled. \"Mom, should we go home? Have that cup of tea?\"\"Maddie makes the best tea in the world,\" Lillian announced, this time her voice not as strong. She weakened quickly these days.J.C. opened the exam room door, allowing them to precede him. Maddie wasn't sure how she knew, but she was almost certain that J.C. continued watching as they left. She had a wild impulse to look back, to see. But there wasn't any point. Her social life had ended when her mother's dementia had begun. And mooning over a handsome doctor would only make her long for what wasn't in her destiny.\"Maddie?\"\"Yes, Mom.\"\"I have a yen for some tea. What do you think?\"That she needed to put longings out of her head. This was her reality.\"Sounds good.\"Lillian patted her hand, having completely forgotten Maddie's words only minutes before. J.C. wouldn't be part of her own future, but Maddie was fiercely glad he was in her mother's. At the rate she was deteriorating, otherwise, Lillian might lose her grip on even the distant past.Chilled by the possibility, Maddie gently squeezed her mother's delicate fingers. They were the last remaining members of their family. It didn't bear thinking how dreadful it would be should that tiny number be halved.J.C. stared after his departing patient. Well, her daughter, actually. Not that he'd forgotten a detail about Lillian.Or Maddie. Refreshing. The one word summed her up completely. From the sprinkle of freckles on her smooth skin to the strawberry–blond wisps of hair that escaped from her bouncy ponytail. His gut reaction to her had come out of nowhere. That door had been closed since his ex–wife's betrayal. Now with everything else in his life…The intercom in his office buzzed. \"Dr. M?\"\"I'm here, Didi.\"\"School's on the phone.\"He sighed. His nine–year–old niece, Chrissy, wasn't adjusting well after the deaths of her parents. It had been a blow out of the blue. His sister, Fran, and brother–in–law, Jay, had been asleep when carbon monoxide had leaked out of the furnace. Chrissy, their only child, had been at a friend's pajama party for the night.\"Dr. M?\" Didi called again.\"Yeah, I'll get it.\" Reluctantly he picked up the phone. \"Doctor Mueller?\"J.C. readily recognized the principal's voice. They'd spoken often since the tragedy. \"Yes, David?\"\"You need to pick up Chrissy.\"Frowning, he checked his watch. It was only eleven in the morning. \"Now?\"\"There's been another. incident.\"Chrissy, once a model child and student, had been acting out. \"Surely she doesn't need to come home this early in the day.\"\"Afraid so, J.C.\" The principal dropped the formalities.\"She started a fight with two other girls. One is in tears, the other had to go home because we couldn't calm her down. J.C., you're going to have to figure out how to get Chrissy back under control.\"J.C. rubbed his forehead, feeling the onset of now near–constant pain. He'd easily diagnosed himself. Stress–induced migraines. Losing his only sibling had been a devastating blow. He and his older sister had always been close. She'd been the one always looking out for him, the one who had comforted him when they'd lost first their father, then not long afterward their mother. And she'd kept him propped up during his divorce. Without her.Fran had been his pillar. Illogically, he wanted to speak to her, so she could tell him how to deal with Chrissy.Opening the day's schedule on his laptop, J.C. saw that he could steal an hour by switching one consultation. After asking Didi to make the arrangements, he drove quickly to the nearby school.Chrissy sat in one of the chairs in the office, her arms crossed, her expression mute. But her posture and body spoke for her. Sulky. From the top of her head to the tips of her crossed feet.She didn't meet his gaze while he talked with the secretary and checked Chrissy out of school. But once in the hallway, her footsteps dragged.J.C. couldn't be mad. Under her rebellious expression was a hurt little girl overwhelmed by pain and loss. He placed one hand on her shoulder as they walked side–by–side, both silent as they approached the car.Chrissy pulled off her backpack and flung it on the floor. Along with the clicking of seat belts being fastened in place, they were the only sounds until he turned the key in the ignition. J.C. drove out of the school parking lot before he spoke. \"You'll have to spend the afternoon at the office.\"Chrissy stared out the window. ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He worked for three years in a supermarket, stacking shelves and working on the till. He was also chair of the shop union. He has since left to go free lance and now writes, leads retreats and offers consultancy.   He has written for The Independent and The Evening Standard and is currently a columnist with the Daily Mail. His weekly supermarket diary, Shelf Life, ran for 15 months in the Mail on Saturday, and he now contributes another weekly column called One-Minute Mystic.   The Beautiful Life  -  re-issued as The Journey Home  -  was published by Bloomsbury in 2007. Simon has led a number of retreats around this book and speaks about it on his site.  The book version of Shelf Life was published by Rider in 2009. The book version of One-Minute Mystic was published by Hay House early in 2010 and One-Minute Mindfulness followed in 2011, which has helped many into an understanding of this life-enhancing practice.    Other books by Simon include Forsaking the Family, which is a refreshingly real and rather shocking look at the sacred cow of family life. This book has now been re-issued by White Crow.   Simon has been a teacher of the Enneagram for 20 years. The enneagram is an ancient path of self-understanding and Simon's book on the subject, published by Lion, is called Enneagram: a private session with the world's greatest psychologist.  Another Bloody Retreat is Simon's desert novel, describing events at the monastery of St James-the-Less set in the sands of Middle Egypt. It follows the fortunes of Abbot Peter and the rest of the community, when the stillness of their sacred setting is rudely and irrevocably shattered.  Simon's most recent book is Solitude  - Recovering the power of alone is published by White Crow.  Simon was born in Sussex but has lived and worked in London for 25 years. He has written comedy and satire for TV - including Spitting Image - and radio, picking up a Sony radio award. He has two grown up children and his hobbies include football, history, the sea and running.

As such things go, those children collectively have ten. By the time our brood was launched - and all have professional degrees - I had pretty much missed \"the corporate boat\" but had a ton of life experiences that would take me in a more satisfying direction - writing. Though I do many different types of writing, my authority lies in limerick poems. Here Be Limerick Poems is my first site and my largest. I have also authored three other books besides An Alphabet Trip to the Limerick Zoo:  Literati Limericks: Academic Arcana in Pithy Quips The Keepsake Book of Love and Marriage The Pocket Book of Limericks (a collaboration with 23 authors) Read more: http://www.here-be-limerick-poems.com/about-me.html#ixzz1dJQPsuC0 Becoming a writer wasn't part of the original game plan, but there I am, included in the University of Pennsylvania's A Celebration of Women Writers, just a stone's throw from Ayn Rand! I am wildly qualified to be a writer, for writers are generalists and I am certainly a generalist. My educational background includes an MA (literature, history, and philosophy), a BS in science, and a BA in psychology. Along the way I once acquired a CFP, a Series 7 brokerage license, and an insurance license (none of which are currently active). I have worked as an English teacher, a moderator for classes in website development, and have been an instructor in a number of Cultural Literacy courses. My venue is online publishing, and I self-publish every work I do because I prefer that my readers decide the circulation of my written words - and they have been very good to me in that regard - over 2000 guests visit most days (data, Winter 2011).

Unravelling the skein of legends about St\nGeorge and explaining how and why he has been portrayed in England for a\nthousand years has been a mammoth task.Then unaccountably in November\n2007 the website became inaccessible and the pages could only be rediscovered\nin the archive on the Wayback Machine. Once I had retrieved\nmost of the pages I decided to make them available in permanent form in a book.\nMeanwhile, at the suggestion of Professor Emeritus Dan Brown, I resolved to try\npublishing my material as an ebook and was pleasantly surprized at how easy it\nwas to do so on Kindle. The reason I did that before publishing a traditional\nhardback and paperback was that I was already busy seeing another book,The American Panorama: A Comprehensive Guide\nto the Culture of the United States,through the press, a process that took\nmuch longer than I had expected.Thus it will be early in 2012 thatSt Georgewill appear in traditional\nformat, courtesy of CreateSpace and with the help of Carolyn Gray and others.\nMarketing reasons have prompted me to change the title toSt George and the Dragons: according to Google Ad Words, 'St George\nand the dragon' is by far the most common search term used for the subject of\nEngland's patron saint.", "related": [], "rank": 3138499, "title": "St George in English History", "author": "Michael H.

After all\nyou put me through? And hell no I don't plan on getting over it anytime soon!\"Khadija and Orlando married shortly college. Khadija\nwas 23 and in a hurry to get the hell out of her mother's house. She and her\nmom had a love hate relationship thing going on ever since Khadija's dad was\nkilled in a drive by shooting when she was 13. To fill the void her mother\nstarted to drink heavily and had numerous abusive relationships. Many times\nKhadija would come home to her mom being passed out drunk and unresponsive. It\nwas up to her to care for her two younger sisters.Orlando had been struggling\nwith his sexuality since childhood but never revealed this to anyone. He grew\nup in a strict Catholic household and his father would surely disown him of he\neven detected a hint of any homosexuality. He was very direct and never minced\nhis words when he openly displayed his displeasure of the life style. \"If any\nson of mine were a fag I would disown his ass!\" This was his dad's famous\nphrase. Orlando struggled to keep his secret throughout childhood and as a\nyoung adult he would soon learn that society was not much friendlier than his\nfather when it really came down to it. At school he saw what happened to \"his\ntype.\" The straight boys would make a gay boys life a living hell. It just\nwasn't worth it to share his secret. Plus his older sister; his only sibling\ncould not have children. And his mom always gushed about how she couldn't wait\nto see her grandbabies.This left Orlando feeling like that burden would be his\nto bear. His mom who was not as harsh as his dad when it came to the gay\nlifestyle still felt like it was a sin. However she did become Orlando's confidant\nduring his teenage years. There were times when the pressure as the only male\nchild became too much to deal with, he \"came out\" to his mom when he was 15.\nThe news came as no surprise, as she would often catch certain feminine mannerisms\nwhen his father wasn't around Orlando would let his hair down a bit. She even\nwalked in one day on him dancing around in one of his sister's dresses. However\nshe never revealed his secret to his dad. She insisted that he told his father\nhimself when he felt comfortable enough.Unfortunately this didn't come to pass\nuntil he would later get caught by his wife having sex with a man and they\ndivorced shortly after. He and Khadija met in college and started dating. This\nwould be his first sexual experience with a woman. Could these feelings that he\ntried so hard to suppress during his childhood have finally passed?That theory was short lived. During Khadija's\npregnancy with their son Omar, Orlando started tipping around with men that he\nwas meeting from an internet gay dating site that he frequented. Khadija was\nnone the wiser until Orlando went missing during Omar's sixth birthday party.\nHe was supposed to be making an ice cream run but decided to stop off to pay a\nquick visit to his lover Aamir whom he had\nmet through one of his internet buddies. Orlando phoned him as soon as he got\nin the car\"Hey I want to see you. I'm horny as hell right now.\" \"Wassup boo?\"\nAamir responded eagerly. \"I thought your son's party was today?\"\"It is, it's going on as we speak. I'm supposed to\nbe making an ice cream run. I called to see if I could get me a quickie.\"\"I'm not home right now. If you aren't scared I can\nmeet you back at the house daddy.\" Aamir giggled.He and Orlando had started\ngetting really messy when it came to their tipping around. It had gotten to the\npoint to when Orlando couldn't get away at night he would leave the garage door\nopen for Aamir to sneak in. Aamir would park his car around the corner, and\nwalk to Orlando's house and wait in the garage for him. Orlando convinced\nKhadija that this was his man cave and forbade her to disturb him while he was\nworking in his shop on his favorite hooptie. If she wanted something she would\njust call him on his cell. He realized that he was taking a huge risk screwing\nAamir in his garage not to mention stupid. But this made the liaison all the\nhotter!\"Sounds like a plan\" said Orlando. \"When you get in send\nme a text, I'll leave the door open for you.\"Orlando returned to the party with the ice cream and\nenjoyed an hour with his son before the text came from Aamir. \"Ok man I'll\ncheck for you, I think I have one.\" Orlando pretended to be talking on his cell\nto one of his coworkers. \"Hey baby I'll be back, Desmond needs to borrow a step\nladder.I'm gonna go grab it for him out of the garage, he's on the way.\"Khadija was so engrossed in the festivities that she didn't' give it a second\nthought. It wasn't until she realized that he had been missing for some time\nand wasn't answering his phone. \"What the\nheck is he doing? We are about to open presents.\" Khadija thought to herself. \"It's\njust like his selfish ass to disappear during his son's party.\" \"Let me go find\nmy hubby, I'll be right back you guys.\"As Khadija made her way closer to the\ngarage she started hearing noises. \"What the hell?\" She thought to herself. It\nsounded like some moaning and heavy breathing going on. Instead of trying the\ndoor she decided to peep in the window. She couldn't believe what she was\nseeing! Orlando was bent over spread eagle face down on his work bench and some\nguy was pounding the shit out of his ass! Orlando was moaning like a bitch. \"Fuck me\ndeeper Aamir!\"Khadija was so enraged that she put her fist through\nthe window. They both looked up to her glaring at them like rabid dog.", "related": ["B00HTMWULO"], "rank": 1922130, "title": "Kuts And Kurves: We work your body in more ways than one", "author": "Midnite Love", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He’s written six books including And Deliver Us From Evil, a trilogy of true-crime stories, the inspiration for a CBS Television movie, Fugitive Among Us, starring Eric Roberts and Peter Strauss.

How old are you?\" he asked, trying to convince himself that he was just getting to know the new babysitter. But he knew that wasn't true. The chick was hot. Sadie felt herself blush slightly as she said, \"I'm 19.\" \"That's good. So, what do you do for fun? Do you go to school? Friends, boyfriend?\" Brett had moved slightly closer to her as he spoke, and the smell of his cologne made Sadie wet. Trying to ignore the warmth spreading in her panties, she replied, \"Um, I'm in college right now. No boyfriend, a few close friends. I go out sometimes, but not a lot.\" Suddenly Brett placed his hand on Sadie's thigh. She glanced up at him briefly and he took advantage of this, kissing her deeply on the mouth. Instead of pulling away, Sadie tilted her head and kissed him back. Brett wasted no time, leaning her back on the couch and climbing on top of her. Kissing her harder, he slid his hand underneath her shirt and bra, wrapping his hand around her large titty and making Sadie moan.", "related": ["B00HFXR68Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bobby, by way of these study guides, has taken this teaching and delivered it to the person in the pew. I am unaware of any other tool that so thoroughly and practically helps Christians understand God’s plan for the local church. I can’t wait to use these studies in my own congregation.”—Jeramie Rinne, Senior Pastor, South Shore Baptist Church, Hingham, Massachusetts“Bobby Jamieson has done local church pastors an incredible service by writing these study guides. Clear, biblical, and practical, they introduce the biblical basis for a healthy church. But more importantly, they challenge and equip church members to be part of the process of improving their own church’s health. The studies work for individual, small group, and larger group settings. I have used them for the last year at my own church and appreciate how easy they are to adapt to my own setting. I don’t know of anything else like them. Highly recommended!”—Michael Lawrence, Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon; author,Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church“This is a Bible study that is actually rooted in the Bible and involves actual study. In the9Marks Healthy Church Study Guides Seriesa new standard has been set for personal theological discovery and corresponding personal application. Rich exposition, compelling questions, and clear syntheses combine to give a guided tour of ecclesiology—the theology of the church. I know of no better curriculum for generating understanding of and involvement in the church than this. It will be a welcome resource in our church for years to come.”—Rick Holland, Senior Pastor, Mission Road Bible Church, Prairie Village, Kansas“In America today we have the largest churches in the history of our nation, but the least amount of impact for Christ’s kingdom. Slick marketing and finely polished vision statements are a foundation of sand. The9Marks Healthy Church Study Guides Seriesis a refreshing departure from church-growth materials, towards an in-depth study of God’s Word that will equip God’s people with his vision for his Church. These study guides will lead local congregations to abandon secular methodologies for church growth and instead rely on Christ’s principles for developing healthy, God-honoring assemblies.”—Carl J. Broggi, Senior Pastor, Community Bible Church, Beaufort, South Carolina; President, Search the Scriptures Radio Ministry“Anyone who loves Jesus will love what Jesus loves. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus loves the church. He knows about and cares for individual churches and wants them to be spiritually healthy and vibrant. Not only has Jesus laid down his life for the church but he has also given many instructions in his Word regarding how churches are to live and function in the world. This series of Bible studies by 9Marks shows how Scripture teaches these things. Any Christian who works through this curriculum, preferably with other believers, will be helped to see in fresh ways the wisdom, love, and power of God in establishing the church on earth. These studies are biblical, practical, and accessible. I highly recommend this curriculum as a useful tool that will help any church embrace its calling to display the glory of God to a watching world.”—Thomas Ascol,Senior Pastor, Grace Baptist Church of Cape Coral, Florida; Executive Director, Founders Ministries", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He later spent a similar time working in the United States. Over the years he developed an interest in writing, and in Poetry, and has published 'the Century Collection' This is a comprehensive collection of one hundred poems and haiku, and is readily available. He acquired strong photographic skills and has had exhibitions to his credit. He was a Semi-finalist in the 2010 Hasselblad Masters has also won various awards in this respect, and the German Luftwaffe use his photographs in their training manuals for fighter pilots. He was sponsored by Hampstead Council for an exhibition, and some of the work sold there, now hangs in Japan and America. On U-Tube various strangers have put his poetry to music, or song and one was even turned into a Hymn. He sponsors his own Website, Radical Rooney.com where he showcases his photographs with stories and articles. He holds a Class 'A' Amateur Radio licence, G4PXZ, and has a number of Patents to his credit. He has been a member of 'Mensa' since 2005, and holds an International Press Card. He hopes to publish his third book, \"For the Love of Dog\" before 2013.

Many collections address the topic of declining water resources around the world: this volume argues for the forces of economic influence that can alter the equation of scarcity…. Highly recommended for any college-level collection.”—CaliforniaBookwatch“We cannot walk away from the threats to water quantity and quality that the authors of the chapters in this book lay out clearly—as well as analyzing many of the institutional arrangements that academics and policy makers are contemplating. While it is not fun to read about these severe problems, we must face up to them and this book does so clearly and with substantial depth.”—Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Laureate in economic science; Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director, Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, Indiana University; founding director, Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity, Arizona State University“Aquanomicsprovides clear and crucial understanding of the steps that must be taken to bring discipline to public policies about a misunderstood resource . . .Aquanomicsreveals the enormous ecological and economic benefits of bringing property rights to water. As with any other resource, if people own water it will be protected.”—Roger E. Meiners, John and Judy Goolsby Distinguished Professor of Economics and Law, University of Texas at Arlington“The authors discuss and illustrate with case studies the economic and political transaction costs of water transfers, and suggest ways to overcome the impediments. This book is essential reading for those wishing to understand water markets and advance more sensible public policies.”—Lee J. Alston, professor and director of the Institutions Program, Institute of Behavioral Science, University of Colorado“The strength of the volume is that the authors are united in trying to explain how much of the present waste and misallocation could be prevented by replacing myriad federal and state regulations with markets. While the authors’ diagnoses and remedies are not all the same, most of them are based on data and make strong cases.”—Anthony Scott, University of Toronto“Aquanomicsis wide ranging and the authors are first-rate scholars. It is a timely volume about our most critical natural resource—water.”—Gary D. Libecap, Donald Bren Distinguished Professor of Corporate Environmental Management, University of California, Irvine“The book provides both a theoretical and historical background, and a wide range of examples that illustrate the usefulness as well as the problems of market approaches to environmental concerns… The book is readable, relevant, and often provocative. Well worth adding to your library and your syllabus.”—Joel Hamilton, University of Idaho“[A]lways thoughtful, well documented, and informative…It will be useful to those in academics, research, and policy development.”—Norman K. Whittlesey, Professor Emeritus of Economics, Washington State University“AsAquanomicsshows, economically and environmentally sound water management is possible, but only if policymakers get the institutions right.”—Jonathan H. Adler, Professor of Law and Director, Center for Business Law & Regulation, Case Western Reserve University“The superb work inAquanomicsrepresents an important step toward understanding those institutions, drawing on history, economics, and law to show how water institutions actually work.”—Andrew P. Morriss, D. Paul Jones, Jr. & Charlene A. Jones Chairholder in Law and Professor of Business, University of Alabama“With contributions from experts in policy, law, property rights, and economics,Aquanomicsbrings together a diversity of perspectives, all focused on an issue of singular importance: understanding and improving our institutions for allocating water. This book is indispensable for anyone who wants to understand what went wrong and what can still go right with water policy in America.”—H.

We need to always, and I mean always, put the horses' and jockeys' safety first. Racing is all about winning, yes, as with most competitive sports. But it is also about the integrity of the sport. Owners and trainers need to be held accountable for the Thoroughbreds they breed and own. These horses run their hearts out, because that's what they were bred to do and that is what they love. But they have no choice of where to go after they are no longer competitive. That is where the integrity of ownership comes in. Everyone involved needs to make a commitment up front to the long respectful life of that Thoroughbred. It's as simple as that.\"Bestselling author of \"Favored to Win!\" Horse trainer, equestrian, and environmentalist, MaryAnn Myers lives on an organic farm in Northeast Ohio with her family.

He has had many incarnations in this life: salesman, dishwasher, film maker, monk, art dealer, entrepreneur, educator, corporate trainer, hypnotherapist, spiritual counselor, life coach, photographer, internet radio talk show host and author. His lifelong search for meaning led him to explore literature, music, art, cinema, science, psychology, religion and mysticism. In Vrindavan, India, under the guidance of a devotional mystic, he learned to connect with Source and listen to the immense wisdom of his inner voice. This awakening led to prolific writing through which he received insights that transformed his life.  He is a self actualized, awakened, free spirited, down to earth mystic. He is deeply spiritual but does not follow any religion, doctrine or norms. He practices living with awareness, presence, gratitude and Love.

She comes from a unique writing perspective not only as an academic, but also because her independent research has utilized some of the best-known and loved lesbian pulp fiction novels from the 1950s and 1960s.  She understands the long tradition of romance fiction and its importance in the lives of women readers. She writes love stories filled with angst, miscommunication, and the struggle to balance love and an ambitious career, whose characters ultimately reach a happy ending.  Her writings appeal to lesbians interested in experiencing the romantic evolution of femme characters. Very often erotic literature for-women, by-women continues to focus on the dynamics of the butch/femme dichotomy.  Femme/femme characterizations are avoided as they often play into more masculine fantasies of what lesbianism looks like.  The insertion of butch and androgynous bodies into lesbian romance fiction is important in highlighting the diversity of the lesbian and bisexual community. However, the avoidance of femme/femme intimacy does a disservice to women variously labeled as “lipstick” or “femme privileged.”  Femme women, both lesbians and bisexual, are often wrongly interpreted as wearing the clothes of the enemy, or trying to Pass as straight.  Her writing validates the intimate and loving relationships between feminine-appearing women.", "related": ["B00CMBD8GI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

J. Bucchianeri spends most hours of the day conjuring tales – when he isn’t napping, that is. If he isn’t snoozing, making up stories, or musing about the space-time continuum, you might find R. J. running in concentric patterns around bogs with his incredibly charming puppy, Buddy, or perhaps making elaborate – and sometimes edible – meals for his own Contessa, Paula, and his perspicacious son, Nicholas. It has been rumored that R. J. is descended from Italian royalty, has a knack for boat building, and is an avid spelunker. None of these rumors has any foundation in fact. He is, however, the author of the Django Jagger series, including \"Django Jagger & The Mirror of the Moon\" and the forthcoming \"Django Jagger & The People of Darkness.\" He is also the author of The Watch That Could Do Anything, a fantasy adventure for kids of all ages.

On a firm foundation of a broad, scientifically philosophical metaphysic we can build a social infrastructure based on sound economic and political theory, which will in turn make day-to-day realities of life more cooperative, healthy and meaningful. This one might call a new theology of collaboration, based, as Tudge defines it, on \"transcendence, oneness, compassion and humility.\" ... Tudge is one of many voices calling for just such a \"nice,\" kindly, new theology. And one might well ask: \"ain't that nice enough for starters? What's not to like?\" ' -- Martin Lockley, Scientific & Medical Network Review 'This wise and far-reaching book points the way to a better, more inclusive kind of science and a better, more inclusive kind of religion in a positive, constructive relationship. This is surely what we need most in the twenty-first century and Tudge is a genial guide for all who feel the need to move on from scientific and religious fundamentalism, environmentally destructive capitalism and an economic philosophy of selfishness, competition and limitless growth. Tudge points the way to a new kind of agriculture, a new way of living in harmony with our planet and the universe, and with each other. This book is an impressive synthesis and is admirably non-technical, conversational and approachable. Tudge, one of our most distinguished science writers, is a prophet for our time, and a very welcome voice of sanity and reason.' -- Rupert Sheldrake 'This book more than lives up to its subtitle. It does indeed challenge big bad ideas, whether they be about the natural world, the human condition within it, or our habits of thought and behaviour, and suggests some bigger, better ideas for the future. In short replace the conventional wisdom. All this is laid out in easy but scholarly fashion, and the conclusions are a personal testament. Think differently is the message. We are now better able to do so.' -- Sir Crispin Tickell 'Tudge is a biologist, brought up on the positivistic prejudices that dominated the mid-20th century, but never able fully to accept them. He seeks to do two things: first, to challenge these materialist prejudices, and, second, to argue that metaphysics are essential to our practical enter prises... The book is written with great humour and in an easy-going, conversational style, and may be taken as a sign of what may really be a change of cultural tide.' -- Church Times 'The title of this book works as an excellent resume: it is well worth reading... This is a powerful book with important ideas. It is easy to read, with a wealth of illustrative stories and a good index. Though not professing to be a Christian the author has discussed his ideas with those who are and is widely read.' -- ThirdWay 'This is an important book and should be read widely... it covers a great deal of ground, all of it of interest and some of it of vital relevance to how we judge the universe and ourselves.' -- Literary Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this lively book,William Reesereveals the debates over rote memorization, threats to health, and even the use and misuse of statistics that were common in the 19th century as well as in the 21st.  This highly original and thoughtful book is well worth reading. (Maris Vinovskis, University of Michigan)Written tests are the bête-noire of contemporary educational critics, who claim that the tests encourage a sterile and rote pedagogy. But inWilliam Reese's tale, they were originally part of reformers' efforts to, yes, reform sterile and rote pedagogy! These stories--and a treasure-trove of other ones--come to life in this new look at the early years of American public schools. (Jonathan Zimmerman, New York University)WithTesting Wars in the Public Schools,Reesecrafts a masterful examination of the roots of the testing culture in American education and the ramifications for administrators, teachers, and students.

Far less has been written about the Kitchener regiments, county based organizations which attracted a much wider audience. This is the story of the East Surrey Regiment initially made up of a mixed bunch of lawyers, coalmen, police, navies, burglars as well as prominent county families. One of the soldiers was a certain R C Sherriff. Surprizingly he managed to survive the entire conflict despite being in the army from 1914 to 1918, and taking part in many of the bloodiest battles. His experiences led him to write Journey's End, the most famous play of the Great War. Lucas has set out to look at Sherriff's role in the War and combined it with the story of the East Surrey Regiment. It covers everything from the dreadful battle of Loos, Somme and Ypres to the desperate defence against the Germans final offensive in 1918. It makes interesting reading.  Lucas has undertaken careful research and paints a picture of a battalion at war, and how it survived.  Military historians and anyone interested in military history will find this book useful and fascinating. - Monsters and Critics", "related": [], "rank": 1545200, "title": "The Journey’s End Battalion", "author": "Michael Lucas", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

God has granted her a forerunner's anointing to call the Body of Christ to repentance and into the freedom of the Spirit of God. This is the inspiration for her books, including Unbelief, the Deadly Sin and Called to Travail, the first two books in a three-part series.

Even as a teenager I used to make up children's stories as I put them to bed while baby sitting. They were always begging me for more, perhaps just to stay up late, perhaps because I used to include them in the stories.Illustrating children's books was an ambition that grew from the early seventies. My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": [], "rank": 2720738, "title": "The Minibeasts (book 1 ) The Minibeasts Parade", "author": "Viv Rosser", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born into a poor but literary family in South Mississippi, she taught herself to read by borrowing (stealing?) her older brother's first grade reader and following her many siblings around asking them what the words meant. She had written several novels, but she became frustrated with traditional print publishing and almost gave up on her dream of becoming an author. Since discovering independent publishing, she has begun dreaming again! Ledell still resides in South Mississippi. Her novels are set near her home, with most of the action occurring in two fictional areas between the Gulf Coast and Hattiesburg: the town of Magnolia and a rural community named Wisdom. Her novels may not be considered traditional Christian fiction, since she will often have at least one main character who has been sexually abused and the abuse will always be dealt with frankly but not explicitly. There is, however, a strong theme of redemption and the foundation of self-worth that can be found in God's love and in Christian relationships. Ledell's characters also have Christian values and self-discipline that determine many of their actions, they pray while running to help, and they attend church on Sundays. Although the first four novels will have a continuing story arc, each will be a stand-alone that leaves no cliffhangers and briefly retells anything you need to know if you haven't read the previous stories. These are planned to be released at approximately six month intervals following the April, 2013 release of her debut novel, \"Take My Hand.\" Ledell’s hobbies are reading (naturally), riding her recumbent bicycle, solving mathematical puzzles, baking, and teaching children at her church.

Or is he the same person who hurt her before?

Both have\nsuffered as a result of what Dylan did five years ago and both of them\nare hoping for a chance to start over. You can't help but feel sorry for\n both of them (yes even Dylan) and hope that things will all work out in\n the end. It's hard not to love them and not to get caught up in the\npassion that they have always shared.This book packed a lot into a small package but you will definitely be\nhappy because Fall was able to tie up all the loose ends for her fans.\nThis is one of those stories you'll be done with far too soon and you'll\n be wishing for more on both Reagan and Dylan.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 40.0}

Once I was on my own, I used my new (and still developing) knowledge about boating to explore far and wide... and sometimes with as many misadventures as adventures. But it was certainly never dull, which is a good summary of what boating is all about. Now in 'Up the Inlet' I venture both farther north, and into move diverse boating challenges. Join me as we together explore coastal British Columbia from a viewpoint on the chuck, a place where mountains drop into the sea. This follow-up volume is a stand-along title that readers will enjoy without reading the previous series of books. There is so many things about cruising the chuck that draws us into another world, and so many places still on my list of awaiting adventures.", "related": [], "rank": 390495, "title": "Up the Inlet", "author": "Wayne J.

In this how-to guide, Shultz charts a path to a better future for the United States and the rest of the world.  He offers his views on how we can repair the essential process of governance. He explains how to put our fiscal house in order so that we can once again enjoy a vibrant economy. He discusses new ways to handle the problems associated with addictive drugs. He identifies proven ideas for effective diplomacy and reveals how we can get better control of nuclear weapons and take the necessary steps to achieve their eventual elimination.Ultimately, says Shultz, the reemergence of the United States as a strong, respected player on the world scene is the key to a more secure world. Now is the time to take a leading role in the creation of a new global and security commons that will benefit the United States and countries around the world. The need is clear, the path is well marked, and the stakes are monumental. We must maintain a sense of urgency as we take the bold actions required to secure our future.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I penned my first short story at the ripe old age of 8. When I got my first computer, I took all my handwritten stories and typed them in.  Afterwards, I tossed the originals.  In my early twenties, I had a bit of a writer’s meltdown and deleted everything.  So, with the exception of the story about the raccoon, I actually have none of my writings from before I was 23.  Which is sad, because I had seven Aislinn Cain novels written along with a half dozen other novels and well over two hundred short stories.  It has all been offered up to the computer and writing gods as a sacrifice and show of humility or some such nonsense that makes me feel less like an idiot about it. I have been offered contracts with publishing houses in the past and always turned them down.  Now that I have experimented with being an Indie Author, I really like it and I’m really glad I turned them down.  However, if you had asked me this in the early years of 2000, I would have told you that I was an idiot (and it was a huge contributing factor to my deleting all my work).   Personally, I really do suffer from a severe anxiety disorder and migraines.  I find both to be huge impediments to the life I would like to lead.  I find solace in the fact that I have found a significant other that tries to understand my obsession with writing, wonderful family members who support my writing obsession and a best friend who understands and accepts me regardless of my quirks and idiosyncrasies.   When I’m not writing, I play in a steel-tip dart league and enjoy going to dart tournaments.  I enjoy renaissance festivals and sanitized pirates who sing sea shanties.  My appetite for reading is ferocious and I consume two to three books a week as well as writing my own.  Aside from introducing me to darts, my SO has introduced me to camping, which I, surprisingly, enjoy.  We can often be found in the summer at Mark Twain Lake in Missouri, where his parents own a campground.   I am a native of Columbia, Missouri, which I will probably call home for the rest of my life, but I love to travel.  Day trips, week trips, vacations on other continents, wherever the path takes me is where I want to be and I’m hoping to be able to travel more in the future. And no, I don’t always write in complete sentences… I refuse to… It sounds stiff and formal when I do.", "related": ["B00E5JZ09I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Reading has been a part of her life since she was a child. She has been an avid lover of classical English and American literature, but romance has always held a special place in her heart.  She devours historical romance novels all summer long, and any type of fiction; thrillers, crime, suspense, and drama.  This is her second published book, and she has one more book, Afraid to Hope, coming out in in the summer of 2014.  All three, Fire In His Eyes, Afraid to Love and Afraid to Hope, are erotic romance standalone novels and are part of her Secrets & Seduction Series.  She is also working on a new series The Bounty Hunters for 2015. She currently lives in Florida, where she continues to teach, with her wonderful husband of nine years, and her sons.  She plans on pursuing her writing career full time very soon.", "related": [], "rank": 559478, "title": "Afraid To Love (Secrets & Seduction Book 2)", "author": "MJ Nightingale", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 46, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 207.0}

He was not going to flirt with her again.\nHe was definitely not going to sit around and obsess over her. Except of\n course that's exactly what he was doing.Rhys twitched as the elevator doors opened and for the umpteenth time\nthat evening he craned his head to see, but it wasn't Paige. With an\ninward groan he pulled off his glasses and kneaded the bridge of his\nnose. He didn't dare ask the old archivist if she was working today or\nwhat her schedule was--that would almost certainly earn him a one-way\nticket onto the \"Creepy Stalker\" list.Truth was he probably belonged on that list. After leaving the library\nthe night before he found himself incessantly thinking about her,\nremembering that dazzling smile, wondering what would have happened if\nhe had gone through with that kiss. He had fought it, tried to free\nhimself of the mental image of those soft curves pressed against him,\nargued with himself that even if he had been whole he was too old and\nnot any kind of man for her to get mixed up with. Up until Claire he had\n catted around without giving a second thought to the women he left\nbehind the morning after, and he had absolutely no business messing\naround with a genuinely nice, innocent girl like Paige. He'd end up\nhurting her one way or another, and she deserved better than that.But this morning had been the first time in two years that he had woken\nup actually looking forward to his day, and he didn't know if he was\ngoing to be strong enough to tell himself no and make it stick. Why did\nshe have to be so young? If she was even three or four years older he\nwouldn't have any qualms. He'd go after her like a shot, get her out of\nhis system, and go back to life as usual.Except that was a big, fat lie and he knew it. He had been deep, deep in\n those golden-brown eyes and he knew there was simply no way he could\never treat Paige like one of his old one night stands--not if he ever\nwanted to be able to look at himself in the mirror again.He wanted her, of course--he wasn't some kind of Boy Scout--but while he\nwas a little hazy on his Old Testament he was pretty sure that one of\nthe Ten Commandments saidThou shalt not take sweet little college freshmen and make them scream your name until they pass out from sheer ecstasy.\n Oh, he was going to break the hell out of that one if he wasn't really\ncareful. Rhys longed to feel her body stretched out along his, her satin\n skin warm and inviting as he touched every part of her, wanted to lose\nhimself in her eyes while he took her to places she had never even\nimagined before. He wanted to be her first--first at all of those things\nhe figured she hadn't come anywhere close to doing yet.But in the deepest, darkest corner of his mind Rhys knew that if he was\nbrutally honest with himself what he really wanted was to be heronly--the only guy to ever have her, the only guy to ever touch her that\nway--and that was what buried icy slivers of fear in his stomach the way\nthat going into a firefight never had.\"Working hard?\"Rhys jumped, head whipping around to find her standing behind him with\nan angelic smile perched on her oh-so-kissable lips. Agitated, he\nadjusted his glasses nervously before daring to speak.\"I didn't see you come in.\"She glanced at the elevator and back at him, and her smile turned into a\n devilish smirk as she realized he had positioned himself to have a\nperfect view of the doors tonight. He was going to have to learn to keep\n his mouth shut.\"I came up the stairs.\"\"Stairs?\" His leg smarted at the mere mention of the word and he berated\n himself for a fool. After a couple of years never using them he tended\nto forget all about stairs.\"I had to drop off a projector cart at the IT desk on the third floor,\"\nshe explained, \"and as slow as the elevator is I figured I'd just take\nthe stairs the rest of the way.\"\"I see.\" Outflanked by a teenage girl. Perhaps he should just surrender now and get it over with.\"So is there anything I can help you with?\" she asked in a flirty tone that suggested all kinds of interesting possibilities.\"As a matter of fact...\" He pulled out the list he had compiled earlier in\n the day, carefully crafted so that she'd have to see him half a dozen\ntimes to fulfill all the items on it. \"Can you take care of this for\nme?\"She glanced over it briefly. \"Sure, Rhys. I'll be right back with the first set.\"His eyes followed her as she headed back to the archives and he was sure\n she added a little extra sway to her hips for his benefit. Not that she\n needed any extra help--the girl was already sexy enough to bring a\npriest out of a coma just by walking into the room, and those skinny\njeans she wore did things to her curves that were going to keep him\nawake at night. A slow, deep wave of desire threatened to submerge him.\nYeah, it was going to be a long night.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
