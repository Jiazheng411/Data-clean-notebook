Loosely arranged by subject, these essays cover the gamut of human experience, seen through Morrow's practiced yet unjaundiced point of view. Whether offering a fact-laden piece on the AIDS epidemic or a personal meditation on the Jonesboro, Ark., school shootings, Morrow manages—without becoming sentimental—to evoke the spirit of a collective America, one comprising sometimes brave, sometimes cowardly individuals who, despite gaping differences of class, education, race and gender, will work together for the common good. Since Morrow is a weekly columnist, the news of the day is often the primary subject. His piece on covering the 9/11 attack is full of an anger that feels fresh years later: \"A day cannot live in infamy without the nourishment of rage. Let's have rage.\" Morrow is less generous to outsiders than he is to America. While his rhetoric is consistently well mannered, Morrow sometimes loses his compassion for the complicated world across the ocean or just across the border. Still, this is a fine collection from one of our most widely read columnists.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This blessedly brief and un-confusing volume, a tour de force that is original, useful, and wise. These two doctors, who have given their professional lives to understanding and helping those who are affected by addictions, now give to the world a consummate gift: what they know. Combining knowledge with love, the authors have moved the dialogue on addictions to an entirely new level. (Edward Hallowell, MD, author of Driven to Distraction)Understanding Addiction as Self Medicationprovides a clear explanation of the reasons behind many addictions, emphasizing the pain experienced by many addicted people.

Brady, MD, PhD, General Clinical Research Center)Recommended. (W.

(Professional Counselor, April 2009)This book clearly explains the self-medication hypothesis, updates and modernizes it, and provides very useful insights and tools for clinicians, patients, and their families....What makes this a special book is the skill, understanding, and attitudes of these very gifted, experienced, and creative therapists.... The writing is clear, enjoyable and a fast read. Moreover, the book is written at a level that can be easily comprehended by sophisticated patients, their families, and workers in allied fields. (Richard Frances, MD, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, New York University)This book is an admirably clear exposition of how a universal human need to manage distress and control emotions can take extreme forms in addicted individuals, leading to perilous solutions and chemical careers. Doctors Khantzian and Albanese creatively use the Self Medication Hypothesis to explain multiple pathways into addiction and describe various exist routes, signifying hope, help and resolution. (Martin Weegman, consultant clinical psychologist and group analyst, Gatehouse Drug Service)Understanding Addictionis an easy and often engaging read and will primarily be useful for patients, families, and perhaps addiction therapists . . . [The authors] emphasize both the importance of other contributions to addictive disorders, such as genetic, social, and family influences, and the need to utilize a wide range of treatment approaches, including agonist therapies and other medications . . . Perhaps the most important contribution ofUnderstanding Addictionis to remind us of the distinct experience, personal history, and intense suffering of the addicted patient.

Two stories, America 1911 and America 1918, explore immigration and emigration from expectant departure to unsettling return, while Grandmother Lidda takes the intimate perspective of an elderly mother left behind. In Her Father's House, Vanna returns seeking refuge from her woeful marriage to a Rome lawyer, only to find she has lost her place in her family. Meanwhile, the deaf mute protagonist of Ciancianedda struggles to communicate with her new husband. Messina's raw and psychologically deft tales render these women's lives with pathos and dignity, and Magistro's lucid translation is at once lyrical and immediate. Absorbing and culturally rich, these stories should help secure Messina's place in Italian letters.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Weisner (American Anthropologist)An excellent analysis of Vygotsky's theory and it will certainly be enjoyed by those interested in the history and theory of psychology.

Highly recommended. --Midwest Book Review's Reviewers Bookwatch, June 1998...This contemporary novel is a must-read for lesbians and gay men who are considering this path.However, this is not just a documentary. Schwab also gives us page-turning suspense, courtroom drama, and human conflict. This novel is populated with fully developed characters who elicit our sympathy in their moral struggle. This is especially evident in the conflict between Keith and his homophobic family. \"Keith turned back to his mother. He reached out to catch her hands in his; she reached for him in turn, clamped her hands around his wrists. He could feel the tension travel from her arms up his, the urge to pull him close exactly counterbalanced with the need to push him from her. They stood locked in place, a foot apart, a chasm between them.\"...  Schwab has produced a thought-provoking novel that probes the complexity of the word \"family.\" --Cathryn Olson, Small Press, Fall 1995...a sobering tale of violence, sorrow, passion, compassion, and parent-love. Without giving away too much, Schwab captures the joy, humor, and disorientation that comes with the territory of parenting a small child.  --The Family Next Door, June/July 1995...a vivid evocation of family life, and a real page-turner.  --San Francisco ChronicleBook Review, June 18, 1995The child's welfare is always the ostensible core of the matter when a kid is taken from or awarded to adoptive, natural, or gay or lesbian parents. In Schwab's novel, the main issue is not just a straight parent's custody versus a lesbian mother's, although that is certainly a part - along with gay-bashing, illegal firings, and family ostracizing - of its searingly painful story.  Keith, in disgrace with his ultraconservative Irish Catholic family since coming out to them, provides sperm for Janice, who wishes to raise a child with her older partner, Sonya, whose three children have turned against her since the courts denied her custody of them. We are treated to battles within battles as these gay and lesbian characters fight, with and against one another, for rights and selfhood. And little, red-haired Heather Lynn is at the eye of this lifestyle hurricane.  Whitney Scott  --Booklist, May 1, 1995 Copyright 1995, American Library Association.

Some kids grow up wanting to be lawyers, doctors or firemen.  I wanted to teach.  After completing my tour of duty as a U.S. Marine in 1963, I returned to college and earned a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and began my career as a history and social studies teacher at Edgar High School.  Over the next 33 years I felt honored to teach so many remarkable minds.  To the credit of my students, I earned an M.S. in Education and received several special awards including Master Teacher, Wisconsin Social Studies Teacher of the Year, National Social Studies. Teacher of the Year, and TIME  Magazine Education Program Advisory Board member.  Through the Fulbright Scholarship Program, I was fortunate to travel and learn about diverse cultures and societies in Sierra Leone, The Gambia, The Netherlands, Egypt and Zimbabwe, Senegal, South Africa and Uzbekistan. While the history of the U.S. Civil War has been written by countless historians and biographers, it is my desire to help make the journey through the pages of history easier,  enabling each student to feel the passions on both sides of  the social lines while attempting to understand the emotions of those involved in the conflict.  This book is an effort to provide recognition for the men and women who fought and died, those who cared for the sick and wounded and those who helped rehabilitate the handicapped. It is a tell-all about the Civil War.  I retired in 1999 and moved to Florida where I live with my wife, Patti, and three dogs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In sometimes thrilling prose, he describes many incidents that may have been the work of terrorists operating in the United States. Unfortunately, little solid evidence is given to support his assertions. There is some truth, however dificult to surmise, in Bowman's overall conclusions regarding the difficult relationships that Westerners may have with the rest of humanity, but these difficulties can be remedied only when acts of violence are desensationalized. As public opinion is mobilized further to enlarge the gulf separating us from the rest of the world, basic issues become more difficult to address, especially those concerning right vs. wrong. Unfortunately, this volume does not contribute to any kind of entente between peoples and, seemingly in an effort to scare the reader, reaches doubtful conclusions.Joseph A.

Southey's not fully sympathetic hero, Charles Patterson, who's a versatile musician, struggles to make ends meet, while his rival, Henri Le Sac, enjoys professional prominence. Patterson's faith in his sanity totters when he thinks he sees spirits, and the strain on his system is compounded when local authorities accuse him of stealing a rare book and a violin—and murdering the apprentice he inherited from Le Sac. Patterson turns amateur sleuth to clear his name. While an unexpected supernatural element distracts from the action more than it supports it, Southey's sure-handed use of period detail leaves hope she'll do better in her next historical.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Roxanne, a sweet girl who sings like an angel, adopts a gentle abandoned cub that adores her. Years later, when a famous pop singer and his entourage arrive to make a music video based on ``The Pied Piper of Hamelin,'' Roxanne is given a starring role; she is soon charmed away to a life of fame and fortune, leaving her beloved bear behind. The morning after her departure, the bear is found dead, upright in his cage as if staring after Roxanne. This is an affecting story, certainly, but the bear's sudden death is melodramatic, and Roxanne is such a sympathetic character that her sudden neglect of home ties is scarcely credible. However, the Pied Piper theme is thoroughly developed, and the misty black- and-white drawings echo the pervasive melancholy of the text. (Fiction. 9-12) --Copyright ©1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

While reviewing the evidence that points to drastic changes resulting from even small global temperature increases, Barnosky also discusses biodiversity's importance, compares rates of evolutionary change with global temperatures, and recounts Earth's four previous mass extinctions. One of her grim assessments is that \"many of the species that humans tend to like\" will be wiped out by global warming, and spur helpful evolutionary diversification only in \"what we normally call pests.\" For the most part Barnosky is less gloomy than curious, able and straight-forward, flavoring his report with a sense of adventure and possibility; by the end of his discussion on humanity's four-pronged problem-global warming, habitat loss, introduced species and population growth-Barnosky will have readers looking to do more than change lightbulbs.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I appreciate your interest in my novels and the personal\ninvestment you have made (or are considering making) to read them. Please know\nthat I have taken great care in producing the best quality fiction of which I\nam capable. Each novel offers a compelling story and several well-developed\ncharacters that I hope you will enjoy and learn much from. I also hope that you\nwill recognize in my writing some of the best narrative prose you have encountered. I\nstrive during the long and complicated process of writing fiction to eliminate\nanything that is superfluous to the story and its characters, and to write each\nsentence, each paragraph, and each chapter in a way that entices my readers to\nread the next.I write and publish my writing first because of the pleasure\nit brings me, secondly because of the good that it might do others, and lastly\n(a distant lastly) for the financial gain it might bring me. So, if you have\nfound (or find) my work worth reading and would like to encourage others to\nread it also, and, if you think it right that I profit some from my efforts, I\ngratefully ask that you pass the word along to your friends, family, and\nassociates. You may also consider writing a positive review here at amazon.com.I have chosen to publish my titles through my own publishing company because of\nthe freedom it gives me to write the best fiction and poetry I can without the\nrestraints of others' requirements and without surrendering control. I do not\naggressively market my titles. You will not find them on the shelves of many\nbookstores. I limit my marketing efforts to my website (and it is there you\nmust go to purchase hard copies of my titles) and to online venues such as\nAmazon's Kindle bookstore. So I'm counting on you and others like you who value\ngood, carefully written, and inspiring fiction to spread the word.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some of the former camp cooks were pretty ingenious when it came to coming up with ideas of how to make their \"grub\" tasty. One cook down in Texas had a bad habit of lacing everything with jalapenos. The cowboys complained that it was hurting their stomach and that they couldn't tell if the food was good or bad. No doubt, such added ingredients worked to hide the otherwise uneatable food some of these camp cooks dished out to the cowboys.Wilson, as the reader will see, was one of those creative camp cooks. Trouble was, his creativity got him hung.Most old time cowboys would get a good belly laugh out of this story.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not long after, he was informed that Maitreya would return within 20 years and that he (Creme) would be given the opportunity to play an active role in this event if he chose to do so.In 1972, under this Master's direction, Creme began a period of arduous and intensive training, as a result of which their telepathic contact became, and remains, continuous and immediate. This relationship has given him access to constant up-to-date information on the progress of Maitreya's emergence and the total conviction necessary to present that information to a skeptical world.Creme lectures by invitation throughout Europe, North America and the Pacific Rim, and is regularly interviewed on radio and television. He receives no remuneration for this work and makes no claims about his own spiritual status. His books have been translated and published in numerous languages by groups worldwide who have responded to his message. He is also editor ofShare International, a monthly magazine read in over 70 countries.\"My task\", Creme says, \"has been to make the initial approach to the public, to help create a climate of hope and expectancy into which Maitreya can emerge without infringing our freewill.\"Says Max Allen of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: \"The Maitreya story is important, and Creme is an admirable spokesman.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why did you write the book in first person?        Many\n of the books I've read have been written in third person. When I\nfirst started writing the book, I was writing it in third person but\nthen I got to a scene where I thought, \"This would have more of an impact if it was written in first person.\" So, a\nlittle less than a quarter of the way through the book I changed it,\nthis is hard to do and I actually still had some discrepancies with my\nlatest edit on the first draft print a year later.    I\n think there are advantages and disadvantages to every form of writing.\nAn advantage with third person is that the writer is omnipresent and all\n knowing. This method gives the writer the ability to divulge\ninformation when they think the reader is ready for it whether or\nnot the main characters know it yet. I just read a book recently\nthat was written in third person; the author was able to let the reader\nknow the identity of the serial killers before the detectives ever\nfigured it out. With first person, the reader knows what the character\nknows. Primal Power is the first, featuring a whole new world with\na whole new set of people. Kara is just thrown into the Malaika world\nwith no warning and little to no knowledge of their history and the\npeople. I wanted the reader to feel the same uncertainty that Kara did. I\n wanted the reader to be just as confused as Kara was. I felt that this\nway it would be easier to understand where she was coming from and why\nshe did some of the things she did.     Another\nadvantage is that it's easier for the reader to discern when I'm writing\n from a different character's point of view. In all the scenes from\nKara's point of view, the book is in first person, when it switches to\nsomeone else (Logan or Ana) it switches to third person.    I'm actually also working on a christian historical romance and it is written in third person.2. How did you come up with the Malaika world?   Many\n people already know this but the whole concept came to me in a dream. I\n dreamed that I was Kara and that Logan saved me from a scary man at my\nwindow in the middle of the night. In this dream, I was reluctant to\ntrust Logan and could feel myself falling for him against my will. I\ndidn't want to take a chance on him but he was just too stubbornly\nwonderful to ignore. He forced me to marry him and I ran, repeatedly\nactually, to escape from my burgeoning feelings. Of course, this is only\n a small part of what has become a work-in-progress of a series of four\nbooks. Without God directing my words I honestly feel as if I never\nwould have gotten this far. I pray He will continue to help me write.3. Why do you enjoy writing?    I\n enjoy writing because of the freedom of expression. Words come easily\nto me when I can write them down. I like to dwell on words and how they\nflow from one to the other and I'm constantly analyzing how things sound\n and blend together. For example, the word \"triumph\" is awesome to\ndescribe a look in the eyes of a male character (in my opinion) because\nit just sounds masculine and almost sensual. The word \"triumphant\"\nthough similar has another feel to it entirely. I would use \"triumphant\"\n for a religious or exciting experience as it reminds me of trumpets and\n celebration rather than conquering and dominating. I think that writing\n has a lot to do with music (which I also love) because certain words\nare just harmonious when combined together.4. What is your biggest struggle when writing?    Details,\n details, details! I have so much trouble describing everything so\nthat everyone can see the same picture I do. Too often, I take it for\ngranted that the reader has the same vision as I do for my characters\nand their surroundings. I think I have good ideas and story lines but I'm\n too broad and rush things, cutting off details in an effort to get the\nstory across. I have to force myself to remember that without setting\nand vivid writing to allow the reader to visualize the story it will\nalways fall flat. I'm too direct and to the point sometimes.5. What is your favorite part or the easiest part when writing?    Dialogue. I\n may forget descriptions and remembering to provide details but my\ndialogue rocks! Somehow, the characters say what I need them to in the\nmost dramatic, intriguing, and humorous way possible, and it comes the\neasiest and quickest to me. One liners are my forte. It's hard to get\nlong scenes going because after half a page I've got a good zinger that I\n want to end the scene with. Especially with Kara's thoughts, words, and\n actions, I always had an awesome place to stop and leave the reader\nhanging, or hopefully to create interest for the next page or chapter.\nShe's just such a funny, quirky, character.6. Who are your greatest role models in the literary world?    I\n know I'm supposed to say some great deep and introspective poet and\nquote Shakespeare but I just can't. I do love Anne Sexton and her\npoetry (she was an American poet who was often in the Psych ward and\ncommitted suicide) but she is not my favorite. I love Ted Dekker! I also\n love Stephenie Meyer and Margaret Peterson Haddix. I like to read Cathy\n Marie Hake, Colleen Coble, and other christian authors. Does it make me\n seem more cultured to admit that I like Edgar Allan Poe?7. Why do you have a pen name?    What\n I write is personal to me. For someone to judge my appearance or my\nintelligence would be harsh but those are things that I cannot control.\nFor someone to judge what I've written can be much more hurtful. These\nare my personal thoughts that I have put a LOT of time and effort into.\nThese words are mine, these words areme. I can control what I\nwrite so for someone to criticize it would mean that I had failed in\nsome major way. It's just easier to keep it seperate. Having a different\n name on the cover helps me distance myself from it and not become so\ncaught up in what could happen and what people might think, not to\nmention the perfectness of my chosen pen name. Kaitlynn means \"pure\" and\n Aisling means \"dream\". When put together, Kaitlynn Aisling means \"pure\ndream\" and the concept for the Malaika series came to me in a dream.", "related": [], "rank": 1481850, "title": "Primal (Seren Hearts Book 1) eBook", "author": "Kaitlynn Aisling", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ralph Greenson, Monroe’s psychiatrist for the last two years of her life, was convinced he could bring her from the brink with an unorthodox treatment, informally dubbed “adoption therapy.” Allowing Monroe to get close to his own family, Greenson “felt she needed actual experiences in her present life to make up for the emotional deprivation she had suffered from childhood onward.” What can possibly go wrong when you “adopt” a borderline paranoid addict who also happens to be one of the most famous people in the world?

Cervo, MD,Long Island State Veterans Home,Stony Brook University School of MedicineDetailed case studies will guide practitioners through Bush's \"Four A's\" of ethical decision-making:Anticipating and preparing for ethical issues commonly encountered in specific contextsAvoiding ethical misconductAddressing ethical challenges with specific strategies and goalsAspiring to even higher standards of ethical decision making and practiceMaking informed, ethical decisions and choosing the right course of action with elderly patients can prove difficult for mental health practitioners. This is especially true when patients suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other disorders that impair their own decision-making abilities. When confronting dilemmas concerning privacy, informed consent, and patient autonomy, use of an ethical decision-making model is essential.In this book, Bush not only presents this practical, 10-step model, but through a diverse collection of case studies, also demonstrates how it can be implemented across numerous therapeutic settings. Nursing, social work, counseling, and psychiatry are only four of the many settings discussed. In essence, the author offers a truly unique, interdisciplinary approach to ethical decision-making in geriatric mental health care. \"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All the bibliographic entries follow the same format: author/editor, translator where appropriate, title, illustrator where appropriate, publisher and date of publication. Alternative titles are listed if appropriate, as well as ISBNs, pagination, approximate reading level, cultural relevance and genre. For each there is a scholarly, critical commentary, ending with any major awards received. There are notes about the author/illustrator’s country of origin or current residency. Naturally there could be debate about the titles selected or not selected for inclusion, and obviously editorial decisions are part of the quality of the book. Considering the thorough approach, the book’s international coverage is staggering. Publications from over 90 countries are included, and there is a chapter on multinational books. There are 46 Australian titles and five NZ titles. There are web addresses for online exploration as well as details of print resources. A further chapter discusses the major international children’s literary awards and the major US awards within the 2005-2010 time frame. The book concludes with an author/translator/illustrator index and a title index.(Australian Library Journal)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nicholas and what is left of his family have migrated to Colorado, where he attends college. They are relentlessly pursued by the mysterious Mr. Miller, but this is no spy novel. The Dal family secret has nothing to do with politics but with an intense and unusual psychic ability inherited by selected males, including Nicholas. His journal recounts his involvement with Jack (female) and her mother, who is dying of cancer and with whom Nicholas forms an unlikely but believable bond. Books in diary form are often stilted, but by presenting interesting people, a provocative story, and good writing, Kennedy's novel avoids this pitfall. It should be considered for purchase by most libraries. Mary K.

Falun Gong: The Force Is With Us by M.E. Brines is a\nconcise guide defining those origins and beliefs and proposing that it\nmight actually be more dangerous to the world than Al-Qaeda. Having\ncommonalities with esoteric Nazism and linked to Buddhism and Taoism,\nthis religion which was started in 1992 grew rapidly in the spiritual\nvacuum of communist China at such a rapid pace that it is the 5th\nlargest religion on the planet and has more than 100 million members. A\nvariation of the Jedi religion in Star Wars, it is rapidly spreading\nbeyond the borders of communist China. What is the likely result of its\nfurther spread? Will it continue to grow at this rapid rate? Do we need\nto fear this phenomenon?In Falun Gong: The Force Is With Us, there are several arguments laid\nout for the possibility that this religion could become more dangerous\nthan Nazism and radical Islam. The staggering growth statistics and its\npopularity because of its Jedi-like tenets ought to be cause for\nconcern. Informative, concise and scary, Falun Gong: The Force Is With\nUs is a warning cry for those who are completely unaware of its\nexistence and an opportunity to understand what it is and where it came\nfrom.", "related": [], "rank": 1360222, "title": "Falun Gong - The Force is With Us", "author": "ME Brines", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And that's why this book is in your hands.Barry Gane explores the reasons so many young people decide to leave, considers the complexities of the adolescent mind, addresses the stages of faith development, and offers effective strategies for reclaiming missing youth.A word of caution: Read this book only if you're willing to take action.

The bad guy, nicknamed Brother Lowdown, whose mother bit off half of his penis, uses his charm and etheral good looks to disarm women who have the same blonde hair and made-up faces as Mommy before he coolly slits their throats. Terra Donlevy inspires in Lowdown more honorable feelings because she doesn't wear makeup or practice any other form of feminine deception.

Their language was the equivalent of what English is today, a language spoken around the world. We see French pride in the novel when Valmont expresses contempt for his mistress Émilie’s newest lover, who speaks “the French of Holland.” In this sense, it is no wonder Merteuil and Valmont behave as they do: They could feel superior to anyone in the world.But it is this belief in their superiority that precipitates their catastrophe inLes Liaisons Dangereuses. They misdirect their energies in order to gratify their egos: Instead of seeking glory on the battlefield or in politics, Valmont and Merteuil use their powers to turn sensuality into a game. And like all games, the sport of seduction as conceived by Valmont and Merteuil has its own rules, even its own playing fields. Laclos, not a sportsman, was a military man, so his use of military metaphors throughout his novel reflects his professional training. But even in this there is irony or at least ambiguity: Why would a serious soldier, the inventor of a hollow projectile for the cannon, the author of treatises on strategy and critiques of fortification systems, seemingly demean his calling by having his villains speak the language of military strategy? He seems to mock himself.Perhaps the military man, who must play to win in order to survive, influenced the literary man coordinating his characters. That Laclos himself was something of an opportunist is also the case, so the moral ambiguity in his novel may also reflect his ability to see what was ethically “right” and realize at the same time that contingency might foist uncomfortable or morally compromising decisions on an individual at any given moment. For example, Laclos was a member of the lesser nobility (only nobles could be officers in the pre-revolutionary French army), but with the Revolution of 1789, he became secretary to the slippery Philippe Égalité (1747–1793), who sided with the revolutionaries while apparently scheming to have himself named constitutional monarch. Philippe Ègalité was guillotined during the Reign of Terror, but by then Laclos had already established ties with the Jacobin Club, the most radical revolutionaries. He somehow survived the Reign of Terror to become an important supporter of Napoléon’s coup against the Directory on 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799). Napoléon rewarded him with a generalship in 1800. Laclos survived the Revolution and the Terror, and triumphed with the rise of Napoléon. But what was the moral cost?Valmont and Merteuil do not have to suffer Laclos’s many political shifts; indeed, they are remarkably consistent in their erotic politics. But we should not assume that, because they engage in conquest and seduction, they are any less professional in their strategy than Laclos was when, in 1792, he participated as an artillery officer in the battle of Valmy, the first defensive victory of Revolutionary France against monarchic Prussian invaders. Far less glorious, attacking an enemy unaware that it is at war, Valmont and Merteuil move forward on several fronts simultaneously.The pretext for this war is revenge: The Marquise de Merteuil has been abandoned by a former lover, the Comte de Gercourt. (Gercourt then steals a former lover of the Vicomte de Valmont, a lady referred to as the Intendante—that is, the wife of an important officer in the royal quartermaster corps. Merteuil learns that the mother of Cécile Volanges, a sixteen-year-old girl who has just left her convent school, has arranged for her daughter to be married to Gercourt. Merteuil, taking the role of field marshal, recruits Valmont: He will seduce Cécile Volanges and make Gercourt into “the joke of all Paris.”) Valmont’s credentials as a seducer are impeccable, and the list of his conquests long, so the project is child’s play for him, as he himself says:To seduce a young girl, who has seen nothing, knows nothing, who would be, so to speak, delivered defenseless into my hands, whom a first compliment would not fail to intoxicate, and whom curiosity will perhaps more readily entice than love. Twenty others can succeed and these as well as I.Merteuil must use every possible argument—Valmont’s getting even with Gercourt, Valmont’s reputation as a Don Juan, even a renewal of her sexual liaison with Valmont—to convince her hesitant ally.In essence, Valmont is a mercenary soldier in the pay of Merteuil. He will carry out her orders even though he has other, more pressing interests—the seduction of the notoriously prudish and faithful Présidente de Tourvel. What he cannot realize is that Merteuil is governed by jealousy and will tolerate no rivals. If Gercourt left her for another woman, then Gercourt must be punished, even if that means destroying a girl’s life. If Valmont falls in love with Tourvel, he must be punished as well, by being commanded to abandon her after seducing her. Merteuil, meanwhile, will proffer examples of her own amorous adventures in order to titillate Valmont and make him jealous. What she does consciously, he does unconsciously by boasting; each succeeds, and disaster ensues. Or, as Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) puts it in notes for an unpublished article onLes Liaisons Dangereuses: L’amour de la guerre et la guerre de l’amour(“the love of war and the war of love”).", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I tell parents what they need to know, spilling the kinds of secrets you won't usually hear from a doctor. I love talking with kids, too-- my style is to keep them smiling and engaged, so they don't mind it when I look in their ears. My young adult novel, Flow, is a fun, fast moving story to captivate young and old alike. I live near Atlanta with my wife, three kids, two parakeets, one loveable dog, and one psychotic fish. My general pediatric practice is in Roswell, and I teach at Emory University as an Assistant Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics.

The worlds and galaxies he sets his stories in are all constructed with solid architecture and engineering. They won't fall down when put under stress.

She also wrote stories to go along with her sketches. People took notice of this \"Child Prodigy\" and her vivid imagination. So KZ was sent to the Einstein School for the Gifted to perfect her talents. At the age of thirteen, KZ started college part-time. As the recipient of The National Portfolio Scholarship Award, KZ attended Temple University in Philadelphia and The Rome School Of Art in Italy. She graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design and Illustration and a Minor in Business.  KZ continued with her creative writing as well. Next, KZ was off to NYC where she worked as a Designer for several major companies. Eventually, KZ had enough of the hustle and bustle of the Big City and headed West.

This book fulfills the need for an objective, clinically relevant source to dispel this confusion.Clinical Child Psychiatryis a textbook of current clinical practice in child and adolescent psychiatry. It is designed as a reference for clinicians that is both easily usable and authoritative, a “chairside” reference for the consultation room.This book addresses a defined series of clinical entities that represent the bulk of current treatment modalities and disorders encountered in 21stcentury practice. It is authoritative in the areas addressed while at the same time being rapidly accessible in format. To facilitate access, it presents disorders in declining order of frequency. The authors believe that worthwhile clinical work must be informed by both evidence-based practice and by psychiatry’s traditional attention to internal and interpersonal dynamics. They are committed to an approach that is broadly biopsychosocial while based on current clinical evidence for a pragmatic, clinical focus.  The book is divided into four sections. The first, Fundamentals of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Practice, addresses assessment, treatment modalities, and planning. Common Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders and Developmental Disorders cover the diagnosis and treatment of the large majority of disease entities encountered in practice. The final section, Special Problems in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, includes a variety of topics such as foster care and adoption, loss and grief, and forensics. The book also includes:New evidence relating to the areas of depression, psychosis, trauma. New insights from genetics, genomics, and proteomics cleverly integrated into chapters on the individual disease with focus on their clinical application. New chapter on consultation and collaboration within systems of careThe book addresses a need for clinicians, many of whom are beginners, non-psychiatrists, or psychiatrists entering unfamiliar territory, to come up to speed rapidly in providing more than perfunctory service to needy populations. This challenge grows ever greater.The book has a companion website with questions to facilitate learning.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This Kindle Single is short and sweet, but there's no shortage of laugh-out-loud moments. And though the naiveté of the narrator feels a bit exaggerated, even given the absurdist tone of the story, Haigh's dialogue walks a perfect balance between the believable and the absurd. When Hoenfhmfjn tells the narrator to \"think of this highway we are on as the road of life,\" it makes you wonder if Haigh didn't lift that line straight out of a late-night self-help seminar.--Kevin Nguyen", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.3333, "rating_total": 20.0}

Huxley's famous 1860 debate with Samuel Wilberforce was a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution, and in his own career. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of Vestiges, he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated whether humans were closely related to apes. Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as gradualism, and was undecided about natural selection, but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. He was instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, and fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition. In 1869 Huxley coined the term 'agnostic' to describe his own views on theology, a term whose use has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism). Huxley had little formal schooling and taught himself almost everything he knew. He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the latter 19th century. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing Archaeopteryx with Compsognathus, he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a theory widely accepted today. The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favor of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

F. Walton, was a British author of Christian children's and teenage books, mainly but not exclusively fiction. Her career as an author of children's books began in 1870 with My Mates and I, followed by at least two others. Then in 1874 came one of her best known books, Christie's Old Organ, which has been regularly reprinted up to the present day. It is the story of orphaned Christie and his friend the aged organ-grinder Treffy. Although she wrote many more books, it is A Peep Behind the Scenes and Christie's Old Organ which have remained well known, continuing to be published by the Lutterworth Press, successor to her original publisher, the Religious Tract Society, until at least the late 20th century, and later available from other publishers, along with occasional reprints of a few of her other works, such as Saved at Sea (1879), to the present day. Her other works include Christie, The King's Servant (1898) and The King's Cup-Bearer (1891).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Foregoing college, James started his own business two days after turning twenty one years of age and after several years as a small businessman, relocated to Chicago and began a career in sales and marketing. Living and working in thirty eight states over the course of near thirty years, he has held various positions from street salesman to national sales management.   An avid NRA member, James has extensive knowledge of American military history, specifically the civil war and civil war small arms. Having a conservative orientation politically, he is a supporter of the American Tea Party movement and strong proponent of the Fair Tax Bill.    A constant consumer of political/military fiction thrillers, James has read the works of Frederick Forsythe, Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, and Brad Thor, to name a few. His favorite, the man whose story inspired his venture into fictional writing, is Vince Flynn, whom Harrison considers the contemporary master of the trade.   James has a diverse alternative interest in automobile motor racing and has traveled nationally and internationally to over sixty major events.   Residing currently in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, Harrison lives with his wife, Maryna, and two year old son, Steven.

With all the hustle and bustle of New York City at Christmastime, this story focuses on Bart, a Scottie who feels he isn't taking full advantage of his city because his owner, Max, keeps him on a leash. On the day Max brings home the Christmas tree, Bart breaks free, and--boom--it's like the musicalOn the Town,in which three sailors have one day ashore to take in all of New York City. Bart rides on the Staten Island Ferry, enjoys the view from the Empire State Building, and sees the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. Then, tired and cold, he heads home to a worried, welcoming Max. The tale is more picaresque romp than actual story. The primary attraction is Garland's Photoshop artwork, which integrates New York landmarks into the glossy, lively pictures. The way Garland bends buildings and curves images to convey a feeling of motion is particularly delightful and creative. Kids who have experienced New York will have the most fun with this. -Ilene CooperCopyright © American Library Association.

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": 3177661, "title": "Gardening For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions Book 5)", "author": "D.C.

I would have rated this book as great storytelling until the ending--then, wow, that ending turned this book into amazing storytelling. I had to go back and reread the start, because the ending gave it a completely different meaning than what I had first interpreted it as. This right here is masterful storytelling in which you can basically tell two stories with the same exact words. Amazing.

It meant travel with her husband, Rob.  During their first free autumn and an extended trip to California, their niece and nephew asked them to recommend some California must-see sights.   What followed, after ten months of learning how to design a website, was Third Age Traveler, an ezine for those with the freedom to travel from a real traveler's point of view.  Third Age Traveler included an online travel agency and Wendy's recommendations for intriguing destinations, tips to make travel easier, books that travel well, restaurants worth visiting, and photographs to bring smiles. As blogging became the way to connect, Third Age Traveler the website eased itself into Third Age Traveler the blog (minus the travel agency) at www.thirdagetraveler.blogspot.com with subscribers all over the world.  That is where Third Age Traveler exists today. Using Blogger’s own counter, one can see that Third Age Traveler is often visited by people looking for good information. Meanwhile family, friends, and readers prodded Wendy to finally take the big step and write a book about her travels.   Reviewing her notes and photos and learning about independent publishing, she settled on what will be a series featuring a different kind of travel book—a guidebook for those going and a memory book for those who have been.  See Sedona  is the first of the series with plans to bring out See Oahu and See Hawaii, the Big Island in early 2013, and then….

He nearly\nbecomes Bob before he musters the courage to try to escape from Bob's memory,\nwith all its mortality, isolation, and misanthropic inclinations.", "related": ["B009ZO1FVA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Every restaurant in Lisboa served incredible plates that changed my gastronomic education forever. You can't go to Lisboa and not go to Pasteis de Belém. Try their famous pastries and amazing coffee. Dieters beware of the temptation in Portugal! After visiting, I also realized that this is one of the hilliest cities in Portugal, very similar to the hills in Porto. As far as nightlife, Bairro Alto is an incredible place to go out and has something for everyone. The architecture in Lisboa is very striking. So many distinctive cultures have existed here before, and have left their marks on the buildings, roads, and monuments that still stand today. The mix of vivid colors with the modern tram system flying through the streets was especially memorable. Another must-see is the Baiuca Fado House, an entertaining place featuring the typical music of Portugal. The owner is a real testament to loving one's job.Overall, it is very easy to get around on foot in Lisboa, making it a pedestrian's dream come true. If you must leave the center of the city, you can take the metro, or grab a taxi. Lisboa is situated right smack in the center of Portugal, making it a short distance from surrounding areas featured in this issue. I recommend renting a car if you have the opportunity so that you can escape the bustling city and enjoy nearby quiet towns where you will catch some beautiful scenery and have your taste buds explode. Whether it is architecture, nightlife, attractions or food, Lisboa proves to offer the very best of it all.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Somewhere along the way, I came across an old American Magazine article called \"The Man Who Influenced Me Most\" by Grey.  The man he referenced was a Mormon named James Simpson Emmet.  As I learned more about Emmet, it became clear that Grey's understanding of Mormons was impacted by Emmet's story. Millicent is the first of two novellas in theRed Rock Crucibleseries that tell this story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After three and a half years of working full time for her community and helping the less fortunate, she found herself penniless and exhausted.  Realizing that it was time for a change, she moved on to “find herself.”  Truly a Jill of all trades, Penelope worked jobs from pouring foundations, with brawny construction workers, to the sly temptress, assigned undercover by a private investigator.     After being stalked by a madman for much of her life, Penelope is a chameleon of sorts, sensing danger and adapting to her ever-changing circumstances.  Now living peacefully on the warm southern California beach and selling her artwork, it would seem a pleasant ending to her story.  But after buying her first laptop, she finally did “find herself” and discover her true love, writing.  Between her tumultuous life and an unrestrained imagination, she is a bottomless well of tall tales and wild adventure.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spend part of my time teaching at a local preschool and writing, while the rest is devoted to my family.  Writing is new to me, but storytelling has been a life long hobby.  I love using words to create images and feelings for others.  I can honestly tell a story about almost anything.  Some of my favorite storytelling memories are of telling bed time stories to my children and nieces and nephew.  They would pick random things, such as the ceiling fan, and I would make up a story about it.  Those moments are treasures to me and I hope they will be remembered by those special children too.  In that way I hope to bring special moments to my readers as well.  Writing offers me an escape from the wonderful chaos that is my life.  Raising two small children takes a lot of energy and I often collapse in my office chair late at night and let my ideas flow.  I often write from an outline, but just as often I simply sit at the computer and type until I run out of ideas.  Then I go back to make sure it all makes sense and works.  Often I find myself captivated by the story as I read because in my mad rush to type it all out I don’t really embrace the story in the way one does when reading.  My husband often laughs at me when I am reading a book of my own while wiping away the stray tear or two.  I feel it is a pretty good sign that it can touch me in that way and I hope my readers can feel the emotion that I try to inject into my stories. I find that I enjoy my self-published status because it gives me the freedom to write what I want, how I want.  I often choose characters who may not fit the norm of what most think of as a hero or heroine.  I like my characters unique and I like their story to flow from me instead of what someone else’s guidelines. I hope you enjoy my stories.  I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  amandaanderson2@tds.net Visit me on the web too http://www.AmandaAndersonBooks.com find me on facebook too!

After completing high school he served a two-year mission in Uruguay for his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he learned to speak Spanish. Upon his return he pursued a career in law enforcement. His first work as a policeman was with the Springville, Utah police department (1979). While taking night classes at nearby Brigham Young University Kirby began writing columns for the local newspapers, first the Springville Daily Herald, and later the Utah County Journal (writing under the pen name Officer \"Blitz\" Kreeg). In 1989 Kirby decided to leave police work and devote himself to full-time writing. He has written a column for the Salt Lake Tribune since 1994, and has written at least nine books. Kirby is a popular convention speaker, and travels widely to appear at conventions and meetings. His newspaper columns have won several regional awards. Kirby, who is active in the LDS Church, often writes about its teachings and how its members interpret those teachings in their daily lives. Since most of the SL Tribune's readership is non-LDS, Kirby attempts to explain (usually in a humorous way) the LDS way of thinking to outsiders. He refers to himself as an \"OxyMormon\". This approach either alienates those Latter-day Saints who feel their beliefs should not be satirized, or endears itself to the reader. Kirby presently (2009) lives in Herriman, Utah. He and his wife had three daughters.

He made a splash nationally with the Clueless George series, which has over 50,000 copies in print. Pat is the editorial cartoonist for the Salt Lake Tribune. His daily cartoons have been seen in Time, Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and over 450 newspapers around the country. He has many books, several of them best-sellers, to his credit which include I Spy A Nephite, and the illustrations for J. Golden Kimball Stories by James Kimball.

More important than that, I am a husband, a father, a brother, and a son.  My wife Maureen and I have been married for over 26 years.  Maureen is everything and more than I could have imagined in a woman and partner in this life.   We were introduced by our youth pastor, Chuck Booher and his wife, Pam.  We have four children.  Kai is our oldest and a young man who is full of zeal, joy, and a heart of gold.  Eden is our beautiful daughter who is friendly, creative, and possesses an inner strength bordering on stubbornness.  Keanu, whose name means 'cool breeze over the mountains' is just that – cool!  He has a winsome spirit, great intellect, organized mind and disarming smile.  Kaenan is our youngest.  He loves to read.  He is wise, funny, and gives honest hugs.   I hope this book helps lots of people and makes lots of money so I can fulfill Proverbs 13:22 “A good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children”. I praise God for the many godly role models in my life over the years.  This book is dedicated to each of them.  First, to my friend Todd Collins who shared the love of God, the message of Jesus, and the example of a Christian since our days in elementary school. Because of his prayers and constant care, I gave my life to Jesus Christ in 1980 and began this incredible adventure!   My pastor Chuck Booher continues to show me what a passionate commitment to Christ looks like.  Tony Allmoslecher helped me realize that the church wasn't optional, but incredible!  Barry McMurtrie taught me that people come to church for their reasons (a wide array of reasons), and if we don't embarrass them, they'll come back.  Dale Borgen demonstrates excellence in leadership and how to continually grow.  George McKinney who has the courage to confront me when I am wrong and the grace and patience to make me into a leader.  My close friend Peter McGowan who lives a life of godly wisdom.  Mel McGowan and Mike Foster are two men impacting God’s kingdom by thinking outside of the box.  Thanks Ginny McDougall for editing this second edition.   I love my brother Jim, who from the beginning demonstrated that “whoever is forgiven much, the same loves much”.  I thank my brother Brad and his wife Tessa who have been generous beyond measure.   And finally, thanks to my mom and my dad, whom I love and respect and hope one day find Jesus in a personal way and also a church they really love!", "related": [], "rank": 3797059, "title": "How to Shop for a Church eBook", "author": "Doug Husen", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He collected and chronicled these experiences in every place he found them, from the shores of Lake Michigan to Upstate New York. As he did so, he was struck by how consistent and similar these accounts were from region to region leading him to the conclusion that all we see, may not be all there is to know...

Ms. White's world building is excellent, creating a page-turner about young adult superheroes and a beautiful teenage heroine named Grace, who straddles the supernatural world and the \"real\" world of ordinary humans. Grace's friend, Ben, and her new boyfriend, Gregory, struggle for Grace's favor as she tries to find her way. The twists and turns of these relationships are deftly handled by Ms. White, and she throws in a few curves I didn't see coming. It is delicious when an author can do that! The ending will leave you satisfied, but wanting more, and I'm happy to report that the sequel is forthcoming. Kudos to Ms. White for creating such an imaginative read!\" --Deborah O'Neill Cordes, co-author of the Roman Time Travel series andThe Other Side of Heaven\"Both Young Adult (YA) and New Adult (NA) genres have become very popular in the last five years. Many of these books are dark, and full of very adult themes including sex, drug abuse, and physical violence.  EnterDiscovery, a YA paranormal book that you can let your younger teens read without fear of exposing them to some of the more 'adult' issues. If you were to install a movie rating system for books,Discoverywould be PG, something that very few YA paranormals can boast. With an interesting society that includes super-powered beings, and a hero who is handsome and devoted to his heroine,Discoveryprovides the expected fare for readers of paranormal romance, in a kinder, gentler framework than we normally see. A perfect book for readers looking for more 'wholesome' fare.\" --Selena Laurence, author ofLove, Lies and British Spies\"Guaranteed to appeal to new adult, YA and paranormal fans. White has a vast imagination, and she's created characters who are a perfect fit for this unique story. The plot is jampacked with surprises . . . a cliffhanger.\" --RT Book Reviews\"It's a perfect summer read: a bit of mystery, a bit of romance and a good plot, it will keep you turning the pages\" --Walking with Nora Blog\"This was a fun supernatural YA fiction read.\" --Why Girls Are Weird“I didn't know that I would love the book as much as I did.

As a teenager, she had several short stories published in literary magazines.  She completed writing her first novel at the age of 17.   Hadena graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in European History with minors in German and Russian studies.  She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena’s primary literary genre is action/thriller.  She currently writes two series, both use action/thriller.  “The Brenna Strachan Series” uses fantasy and the “Dreams & Reality Series” uses murder mystery as its secondary genre.  She continues to explore and expand her writing and hopes to soon produce a comedic action/thriller.  When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader,  reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.  One of her all-time favorite books is “Good Omens” by Neil Gaimen and Terry Pratchett.  She writes all of her books while listening to music and the bands tend to get “honorable mentions” within the pages. http://www.facebook.com/hadenajames hadenajames.wordpress.com", "related": [], "rank": 880221, "title": "The Dysfunctional Honeymoon (The Dysfunctional Chronicles Book 3)", "author": "Hadena James", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now I can't keep the story ideas from compiling in my brain! I hope my stories encourage women to look for positive qualities in a life partner, and to foster an environment of real romance, rather than fantasy, as they grow old with that special someone. I grew up on the Columbia River Gorge in a tiny cabin built by my father. After high school, I left the Gorge area to attend Northwest University, where I graduated with the first group of students to earn a bachelor's of psychology. My goal was to become a marriage and family therapist because I had seen too many families torn apart. I wanted to join the ranks of great counselors like Kevin Leman and Gary Smalley. Instead, I'm now, after years of hard work, a published author. I don't think I'll be going back to graduate school any time soon! I'm a member of the Christian Writers Guild as well as the local Alaska Writers Guild, where I served for 4 years on the conference committee. I currently live in Alaska with my husband, 2 children, 2 boxers, and a cat.

In\nthe late 1960s, the United States eventually took the Soviet Union's psychic\nresearch seriously and began psychic research programs. Additional\njustification for the US initiating such programs came when the intelligence\ncommunity, around 1970, learned the Soviet Union was spending 60 million rubles\nper year on psychic research. Therefore, as with the arms race, the two super\npowers began a race in psychotronic research, including remote viewing.    It is with this background that I\nhypothesized a scenario bringing psychic warriors from the two super powers to\nbattle each other in the paranormal theatre of war.", "related": [], "rank": 4033909, "title": "The Ninth Martini", "author": "Craig L.

This compendium of extraordinary papers and essays reflects more than five decades of research, reflection and clinical practice. It documents and explores Professor Browne's life-long journey of scientific enquiry,therapeutic evolution and personal development, and is an excellent companion volume to the equally impressive Music and Madness. The Irish intellectual landscape contains very few thinkers who can match his intoxicating combination of scientific method, intellectual rigour and willingness to evolve in his thinking over the course of his remarkable career -Brendan Kelly, Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry, University College Dublin.  As a final year medical student with Ivor Browne in the late 1980s, I greedily purloined many of these papers from his (always open!) office and still have the dog-eared, underlined copies in a large lever arch file marked \"Ivor\". I knew then, as now, that these writings were not just the reflections of a learned man, but urgent messages. How we relate to suffering, both our own and that of others, is one of the great challenges of being a human being. These papers starkly illustrate how removed Irish society, and the modern world in general, has become from this theme. Listen to this man! Join him in understanding that we must redefine our relationship with many things... Never angry or hopeless, often humorous, almost always offering a (albeit often radical!) solution, these writings are those of a wise and gentle giant. Malcom Garland,Consultant Psychiatrist, Dublin North Mental Health, Services and Senior Lecturer, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland  Ivor Browne is a great psychiatrist and an original thinker. These eloquent and searching essays chart the progress of his mind as he sought to find new ways not only to heal his patients, but to work out a better way for the society around them to progress.

His focus was then put on that as the creator of the music magazine Platinum Bound that featured the stars of tomorrow. Steven's pioneering ventures landing him in the music history books.  Years later, he became recognized as one of the top graphic artists/air-brushers in the country, and once again, he set the pace for others to follow. This led Steven back into journalism. He wrote instructional articles for art magazines such as Airbrush Action. As the Internet began to take over and open up new possibilities, Steven created the first ever \"fully interactive\" digital magazine. AirbrushTechLive took digital publishing to a brand new level.  Now he's doing it again in the literary world by breaking all the rules to produce literature that is unique, fresh, and staying true to everything he has done in the past, highly controversial in nature.", "related": ["B004OL25XG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She will take you very deep into the dark and secret world of Katt Williams, as his personal assistant and stray.  Her words of true testimony are the long-awaited front row seat to an unearthing like never before.  It's such an exceptionally captivating and intensely mind gripping report of events that begins when they first met in 1999.  This is the anecdote for all who have been aroused with a certain curiosity about Katt Williams private circle.  The answers that she gives to so many unanswered questions, in the past, are very hard-hitting and uncompromising.  There's very little to be humorous in the up-close and personal side of Katt Williams.  It instantly compels you from start to finish to be intensely absorbed.  Her honesty, compassion, and sincerity all come shining through in what is also her very gritty and tremendously painful truths.  And it will definitely overwhelm you as she takes you step by step, very candidly, through the incredibly mind blowing leaps and bounds that she took to redeem her life with God.  It's without question an exceedingly narrow and unusual spiritual path where God has planted her feet.  It's so extraordinary that you'll also find it to be most unforgettable.      She is also the author of SUMMONED BY GOD \"Ruler Ten Coming U.S.A. - Heat!\" and Celebrity Inner Views from God.", "related": [], "rank": 147825, "title": "STRAYED \"My Katt Williams Experience\"", "author": "Ursula Renee Cottingham", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His drawing technique is the most classical one: boards, pencils, ink and lots of brushes and nibs.", "related": [], "rank": 2903172, "title": "The Lydian's Treasure eBook", "author": "Giancarlo Cogoni", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unfortunately, the way Kate stumbles upon her unique and high paying opportunity means the dashing yet arrogant billionaire believes her to be a prostitute. A reasonable assumption since she was hired as an escort initially. After a rocky start pierced with many moments of pure attraction, their lust is satisfied but quickly starts to grow into something more. Clarissa Cartharn writes a beautiful and poignant retelling of Cinderella in Red Collar. Kate struggles with her job, with what she is resorted to doing for survival, but at the same time she feels drawn to and inflamed by Clayton.Six days. That is all it should have been between Kate and Clayton. Six days playing a young couple madly in love for his family. But it could never be because she is a feisty woman who doesn't bend to his whims and he's a handsome billionaire who makes her lose her mind with one touch. Clarissa Cartharn put a truly fantastic spin on Red Collar, simply dropping the reader into the tumultuous relationships in Kate's life. The way she paints Clayton as both arrogant and kind takes the reader on a journey to discover who Clayton Reid really is and if that man is good enough for kind and caring, if a tad bit cynical, Kate Ripley. Between the burgeoning love they both try to fight and the steamy erotic scenes, Red Collar will have you wishing for your very own Prince Kinda-Charming.", "related": ["B00EW6QX0E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 70.0}

Being interested in how we think as humans and how we all achieve different levels of success, yet all have the same equipment, Robert spent many years studying material in the personal development genre, exploring how our minds work. The last few years has seen Robert putting into practice some of the amazing things he has learnt about the mind and how we use our thoughts and beliefs to control our lives, sometimes without even being aware that we are doing so. He set up his own website, www.awesomeminds.com which as you may have guessed from the title is all about how awesome our minds really are. As the new year turned and 2013 arrived, Robert made a decision to lay down his own understanding and ideas of this subject, so he could help other people to improve their lives, and so began writing his first book 'A Fabulous Life' which is now complete. Knowing that he has more to share, Robert has been busy working on his next book.

Sometimes a story develops slowly over time, inspiration trickling in. Other times, it comes in a flash. With Measure of Devotion, it came as an image.I was standing outside my bedroom closet when, as clear as day, I saw Kale in the last scene of Measure of Devotion. I instantly forgot what I was doing. There was something about him that drew me in. The anguish on his face was so compelling. I had to know how he got there. What had happened to him?Over the next few days, Kale told me his story. I was instantly in love with him, and getting to know him and Jason was like connecting with old friends. I even found myself feeling for Renee and the difficult situation in which society had placed her. All the characters came together to form the story of Measure of Devotion.The first person who ever read Measure of Devotion was my best friend. I actually read the end to her while she was driving and I was positively giddy to see that she cried. I was elated that she felt so close to the characters that she was brought to tears by their pain. The very first thing she wanted to know was what happened next.\"That's the end,\" I told her.\"You can't do that,\" she said.From the beginning, I had intended Measure of Devotion to be the story of this particular slice of Kale's life. Nothing more. I was happy with the ending. Kale got what he wanted, and that was that.\"Well then, write a sequel just for me.\" As if novels are the product of a long weekend.This argument went back and forth and ended with me conceding that I would remain open to inspiration for a sequel, but I wasn't going to force anything.Life continued.Work progressed on getting Measure of Devotion published, but there was that nagging voice of my best friend demanding a sequel. I spoke to Karen, my editor, about it and she liked the story as a standalone. She understood that I liked it as it was: a beautiful, bittersweet story of a man who experienced true love instead of the selfish love that is so rampant. However, she did think that a sequel would certainly be welcome if one came to me.Meanwhile, I moved on to other stories while Measure of Devotion was being prepared for publication.And that's when it happened.As soon as I turned my attention to another story, inspiration struck again. Only this time, it was Jason who called to me. I saw him sitting in the bar at the beginning of Measure of Strength. I needed to know where he was going from there.It didn't take long for Measure of Strength to take form after that. Additionally, I knew what would happen in a third book, although I didn't think at the time anyone would ever be interested.Why do I tell you this now?Mainly because several people have stated that I only wrote Measure of Devotion as a cliffhanger and setup for Measure of Strength. The truth is, the sequel wasn't even a thought until right before Measure of Devotion was released. I'm sure after reading this, those of you who thought I was mean before will think me doubly so now that you know I was willing to let Measure of Devotion stand.Also, my best friend wanted credit for the sequel.So there you have it, the story of how Measure of Devotion came to be.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 78.0}

I\nmean, how sexy is it to fall in love with a Viking / Scottish warrior /\nCowboy / PIRATE when the dude must have had some nasty hygiene issues?\nHence began The Noble Pirates.

They sat absolutely still, completely focused, and followed the whole\nstory. They clapped at the end, which they only do for stories they really like.\nI thought that it might be a little too complicated a plot for them, I had it\nfigured as a first grade book, but they really followed what was going on. So\nthere's a professional opinion for you. It's definitely a keeper in my\ncurriculum. Thanks very much, and congratulations.\" \"....My brother had to go out of town for several days and I had my 2\nnephews age 4 and 6. I read the book first and really enjoyed it. The true test\nwould be the boys. I told them I had a special story to tell them before bed, and\nI kept telling them that all day long (hoping they would want to go to bed\nearly to hear the story). They kept asking me all day long about Dr. Jeff and\nthe skunk, and I told them they would have to wait till bedtime. Well...they\nloved the story and the fact that the skunk came back to help Dr. Jeff. It kept\nthem interested and wanting to turn the page the see the new pictures and what\nhappened next! Congratulations on the book and the best of luck.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2685701, "title": "ebook,Jeffrey Gilbert, Regina Farrell,Milton's Moment,Jeffrey Gilbert, MD,NATURE / Animals / General,JUVENILE NONFICTION / Animals / General\" />", "author": "Jeffrey Gilbert", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sadly, George died in 2012, but happily Nicholls is back with an account that shows why the archipelago that shaped Darwin’s ideas still matters to us.”—New Scientist, 2014 books preview“[A]n accessible introduction to the islands’ natural history.... [Nicholls’] writing is always skillfully rendered and his enthusiasm for the islands, where he has spent much time, is palpable.... [T]his book is a solid addition to the existing literature on the Galápagos. A pleasant, anecdotal work, it will delight armchair travelers and tourists hoping to maximize their own trips to these magical islands.”—Library Journal“A fascinating overview of the natural and human history of this remarkable archipelago, from prehistoric times to the present.”—Kirkus Reviews\"I have been to the Galapagos five times, including an extended private expedition retracing Darwin's footsteps in these magnificent islands that so inspired his insights into the evolutionary process. I thought I knew everything about the islands until I read Henry Nicholls'sThe Galapagos, the best single-volume work I've found and the perfect guide for travelers. Every visitor to the islands should be given a copy of this marvelous natural history to read in order to fully appreciate the richness of one of the most important pieces of real estate on the planet. A captivating book.\"—Michael Shermer, publisher ofSkepticmagazine, and author ofWhy Darwin Matters“Tourists should read this book before they visit the Galápagos. In a relaxed and conversational style, Henry Nicholls introduces many of the animals and plants that live there, explains why so many are strange and unusual, and shows how natural history has been first shaped by geological history and then influenced by human history. The book is an inspiring call to visit the islands, to experience the animals and plants in the sea and on land, and to join in conserving them.”—Peter Grant, Professor Emeritus, Princeton University, and coauthor of40 Years of Evolution: Darwin's Finches on Daphne Major Island“Nicholls’s book is filled with fascinating natural history tales, from volcanically-heated seas melting the resin that holds a ship together to encounters with foot-long centipedes, and also includes a sobering, but ultimately hopeful account of the efforts to conserve the archipelago’s flora and fauna. It’s a book you’d want to read on a plane flight to the Galápagos. It’s also a book that will make you want to book that flight.”—Alan de Queiroz, author ofThe Monkey’s Voyage“The Galápagosis an engaging, informative introduction to the natural history of the archipelago. Charles Darwin’s observations and insights on the Galápagos are effectively used to highlight key aspects of the archipelago’s terrestrial and marine environments, the unique plants and animals they support, and how our understanding of them has evolved since his historic visit. The book also gives an accurate account of the current challenges facing Galápagos, and how they are being addressed. A surprising amount of information is packed into this concise and entertaining overview. An inspiring pre-travel read for anyone considering a visit to ‘Darwin’s Islands’.”—K. Thalia Grant and Gregory B. Estes, authors ofDarwin in Galapagos“In his new natural history, Henry Nicholls transforms the Galápagos archipelago from perennial example to subject. Chapters devoted to geology, plants, animals, and insects finally provide a landscape framework for some of biology's most famous stories—from Darwin's finches to the giant tortoises that give the islands their name. Nicholls also includes a welcome and thoughtful discussion of the archipelago's most recent and transformative arrivals, its people.”—Thor Hanson, author ofFeathersandThe Impenetrable Forest“Henry Nicholls has turned his most observant eye on the remarkable, but less often described human history of Galápagos. The future of the islands and their distinctive biota will be in the hands of the national lawmakers and growing number of Galápagos residents as the isolation enjoyed by Galápagos becomes a distant memory.  In his lively prose, Henry lauds the unsung scientists and conservation managers who work doggedly and successfully on persistent wildlife management challenges wrought by human accident or design.  His persistent focus on stewardship—man’s absolute responsibility to nature—is refreshing and important in the world of natural history literature.  A thoughtfully executed and excellent read.”—Johannah Barry, president of the Galapagos Conservancy“If you read one book about the Galápagos, make sure it is this. Thoroughly researched, highly informative, lively, and enjoyable, each page is a real pleasure to read. Whether a first time visitor or an old Galápagos ‘hand,’ Henry Nicholls’sThe Galápagosshould accompany you on any physical or virtual trip to these Enchanted Islands”.—Ian Dunn, chief executive officer, Galapagos Conservation Trust“This is the perfect book to take with you if you are planning a trip to the Galápagos. Even if you are not, this is an enchanting and enlightening account of the most scientifically significant islands in the world.”—Tim Birkhead, author ofBird Sense“Henry Nicholls has added an informative, fun, and up-to-date read to the Galápagos literature.  By sprinkling his discussion of the geology, biology, and history of the islands with quotes from historical figures, including Darwin, the Bishop of Panama, Herman Melville, and many others, he takes the reader on a unique journey of discovery of the wonders of Galápagos.  He merges historical information with up-to-date science and conservation, then brings the reader back to the sites and species they will see when visiting the islands.  Most importantly, he discusses why Galápagos matters and the challenge to all of us to ensure its long-term protection.”—Linda J.

She grew up in various towns along the eastern seaboard, raised in an environment where writing and researching the past were as natural as spending weekends tromping through old-growth woods looking for stone wall foundations.  Her concept of art focused on cemetery stone rubbings and photos of old homesteads.  When Lisa moved to Sutton, Massachusetts in 1995, she finally found her true home. Sutton's rustic charm, dense forests, and bucolic farmland all resonated with her creative spirit. The stories she had been writing since she was young now had a fertile ground in which to flourish. Lisa's first book set in Sutton, Aspen Allegations, was written in November 2012 in a chapter-a-day style. Each day she explored Sutton and its surrounding areas and then wrote those experiences into the chapter. The mystery-romance earned a gold medal from the 2013 IPPY awards. Her second book, Birch Blackguards, was written in the same chapter-a-day style in August 2013. The third book in the series will be written starting on May 1, 2014. All proceeds from the Sutton Mass Mysteries series benefit local battered women's shelters. Lisa Shea has written 18 fiction books and 67 non-fiction", "related": [], "rank": 372525, "title": "Birch Blackguards (A Sutton Massachusetts Mystery Book 2)", "author": "Lisa Shea", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her writing credits also include \"Newt's World Beginnings Workbook\" (teacher's and student's editions), the second in the series entitled, \"Newt's World: Internal Byte\" and accompanying workbooks. Susan Womble lives in Tallahassee, Florida with her family. She is a National Board Certified teacher with a career of teaching grades K-12th in the areas of reading, special education, language arts, math, social studies, and the profoundly handicapped. While teaching overseas in Hohenfels, Germany, she traveled extensively throughout Europe. Her first series deals with issues she saw in her class. She looked at her students in her classroom and wrote her book with video gaming, computers, texting, technology, virtual worlds, bullying, cyberbullying, tolerance, and fitting in issues. Her book is a story of friendship. The hero Newt who uses a wheelchair discovers what friendship is about and how to deal with bullies. “The Big Wheel” and “Take the Helm” are dystopian stories. Womble decided to write about her experiences in Bavaria in these books using her firsthand accounts of the setting to weave a tale about a society long separated that has to find a way to work together again.
