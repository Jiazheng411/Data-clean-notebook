The 128 entries range in length from 400 to 4000 words, and include biographies of women from all regions of the U.S. Well-known figures such as Harriet Tubman, Clara Barton, Louisa May Alcott, and Mary Todd Lincoln are represented but so too are African-American sculptor Edmonia Lewis, poet Lucy Larcom, and Emma LeConte, whose Civil War diary is \"one of the clearest articulations of the patriotic ideals and emotions of Southern white girls and women who clung to their faith in the future of the Confederacy.\" As well as biographies, there are superb thematic entries on women living in the West, prostitutes, industrial workers, family life, and invasion and occupation. Discussions of such events as the New York Draft Riot of 1863 or the Battle at Gettysburg explain the role of women or the event's consequences in regard to women's lives. Much of the information came from primary sources, especially diaries, and students are sure to find them fascinating. A few black-and-white photographs are included. Cross-references direct readers to related articles. Each entry is followed by a short list of suggested readings.

It's 1928, and Woodrow and his recently widowed mother relocate from Washington, DC, to Lawton, his father's hometown. The 13-year-old misses his father but hopes that his neighbor, Senator Crawford, who had lost his own son, will fill that void. Crawford takes Woodrow under his wing and introduces him to \"the right kind of people.\" However, before long, the town's ugly secrets are revealed. Woodrow discovers that the senator is the imperial wizard of the local Ku Klux Klan and witnesses Crawford whipping a \"Negro man\" during a nighttime meeting. Afterward, the senator pressures Woodrow to commit to this way of life, and the boy struggles between wanting the acceptance and love of this father figure and following his own moral compass. Tensions build to a fever pitch, positioning Woodrow to make complicated decisions and perform hurtful actions that have consequences beyond his understanding.

This short-'n'-sweet 72-page guide cuts out the jargon, and  shows you how to manage the position-filling process in three key stages:  preparing for interviews (writing the job description and ad, deciding how to  recruit, assessing résumés, selecting interviewees and arranging  interviews, preparing questions, and honing your listening skills), conducting  interviews (evaluating an applicant, guiding the interview, reading body  language, and opening and closing the right way), and analyzing interviews  (recording impressions, making a shortlist and conducting call-back interviews,  matching an applicant to a job, and making a final offer). Throughout, boxed  tips; sample job descriptions, résumés and formal offers; handy  checklists; and easy-to-follow and adaptable flow charts clarify the  interviewing process, and bring it to life. Granted, if you're looking for very  specific or in-depth guidance, you might find this book too cursory and general  in its approach. But, if you're looking for a thumbnail guide to the basics,  it'll do just fine.It's worth mentioning that the book is part of the \"Essential Managers\" series  by reference publisher Dorling-Kindersley--a series comprising 20 itty-bitty  books on business and career topics that range from communication, leadership,  and decision-making to the management of time, budgets, change, meetings,  people, projects, and teams. Combining the talent of the \"For Dummies\" book  series for breaking down a lot of information into bite-sized bits and sidebars  with Dorling-Kindersley's signature design style of crisp, classy graphics on a  gleaming white backdrop, the books don't represent the cutting edge of business  thinking or reflect necessarily any unique individual perspective. Instead, it's  as if someone had collated the best general thinking on these 20 topics, and  rolled them out into 72 brightly designed and easy-to-read pages--studded along  the way with boxed tips, color shots of a multiracial cast of \"coworkers\"  animatedly hashing through the workplace issues of the day, and, on the last few  pages of each volume, a self-test of one's skills in the topic at hand. Again,  they're not for anyone who's looking for more in-depth or focused help on any of  the covered subjects, but they're perfect as a quick general-interest reference;  and, let's face it, they're so damn cute, and look so smart in a neat little  stack or row, that probably you'll want to buy a whole bunch to give as gifts to  your entire staff or department.--Timothy Murphy", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They were invariably draped in toga-like robes and adopted pseudo-Grecian poses. In the 1930s, ads for a Midwestern varnish company used completely naked models; as they were used in trade magazines with an almost entirely male readership, it was considered unlikely that any woman would ever see them. Reichert, a University of Alabama advertising professor, unearthed these tidbits and others in the course of researching this entertaining and fairly comprehensive history of the use of sex in American advertising over the past 150 years. At first, this research may seem unnecessary, since the sex and advertising are so inextricably intertwined. Yet Reichert plots a telling time line, from the late-19th-century petticoat-wearing women coyly exposing themselves on beer tavern walls to the double entendres of 1960s magazine ads and the lasciviously photographed nudes plastered throughout today's fashion glossies. Although Reichert doesn't delve fully into the social ramifications of the constant rise of and backlash against overt sexuality in advertising or how the ads are targeted differently at men and women, he provides a fun, accessible survey of a subject everyone's familiar with.

She especially doesn't want to talk to her new father, Sam, or her new step-brothers, Rory and Jake. Lizzie is afraid of the changes in her life, and very concerned that the good times won't last. She stops speaking to punish her mother and as a test for her stepfather. Everything begins to change when Lizzie meets her new step-great-grandmother and her doll collection. The story is engaging and the characters are realistically drawn. British actress Sophie Aldred does a superb job as narrator. The Briticisms might be distracting to young listeners, although they are not essential to the plot.

Rabbi Schreiber here provides an accessible entry into this remarkable prophetic person, voice, and tradition that live in the extremities of faith. Accenting the key issues in this prophetic articulation, Schreiber shows the bold way in which Jeremiah moves in revolutionary leaps beyond the closed tribalism of his antecedents. This wise book merits careful and sustained attention. It will evoke conversation that will continue to vex and nourish responsible faith, just the vexation and nourishment the prophet himself intended. The move toward an inclusive openness voiced by the prophet continues to be a demanding agenda for his present-day readers. (Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary)Books like Mordecai Schreiber'sThe Man Who Knew God: Decoding Jeremiahare important because they clue us in on what we are missing....the author does an admirable job of elucidating the remarkable historical significance of the prophet for Jews and Christians. (Tikkun, July/August 2010)Jeremiah is a critically important sacred author but not easily understood. Rabbi Schreiber takes his readers through the vicissitudes of history, theology and linguistics in a way which is scholarly but also accessible and spiritually rewarding. . . . Highly recommending this work, I likewise express hope that teh author would consider follow-up volumes on the other major prophets. (The Catholic Response, Fall 2010)Rabbi Schreiber's central idea, that Jeremiah was the model upon which the author of the famous Suffering Servant songs in the book of Isaiah based these poems and which, in turn, served as a significant inspiration for Jesus' ministry, is both elegantly simple and profoundly important for Jews and Christians. It is high time that we celebrate what we have in common rather than fighting over our diffrences. Rabbi Schreiber helps us to do that. (Alice Ogden Bellis, Howard University School of Divinity)What Mordecai Schreiber has achieved in this work,The Man Who Knew God: Decoding Jeremiahis nothing short of some very incisive detective work…. Schreiber makes a strong case for the exceptional teachings of Jeremiah…. The book is supplemented by a map of the Kingdom of Judah in Jeremiah's time, a relevant timeline of events, a chronology of events in the book of Jeremiah, as well as Notes, a Bibliography, an Index, and Index of Biblical Passages. (CCAR Journal: The Reform Jewish Quarterly)The Man Who Knew Godunravels the complexities of the book of Jeremiah and argues that this prophet is the key figure in shaping Western civilization. Mordecai Schreiber posits that Jeremiah is not only the one who eradicated paganism amongst the Hebrew people, but he can also be considered the founder of the post-biblical Jewish faith.(Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal Of Jewish Studies)Schreiber has written an excellent monograph on Jeremiah's life and message.... With valuable insights into the text of the Bible,The Man Who Knew Godprovides a stimulating read and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the study of Jeremiah, particularly, and in biblical prophecy.(Andrews University Seminary Studies)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With ‘Sheep in the Fold’, his first novel, he is indulging a long held fantasy to explore, through works of fiction, the affairs of governments and large, non-government organizations, both foreign and domestic and what crimes one might find within that milieu of the rich and the influential. If only one could point an invisible looking glass into the hidden inner workings of such tightly closed organizations, what might one find out? In creating fictional heroine F.B.I. agent Karen Raney and disabled American veteran anti-hero, Johnnie Pellagio and the clandestine patriot organization that Johnnie has founded and leads, the author has assembled just such an invisible looking glass. This looking glass is a vehicle capable of negotiating the hidden pathways of large organizations and exposing their secret inner workings. Now, finally, through the exploits of Karen Raney and Johnnie Pellagio, inquisitive readers and addicts of fictional crime and mystery writings have access to this powerful vehicle. Readers can join Karen and Johnnie and interact and move with them through their fast paced, always intense and sometimes explosive world. The reader will become intimately involved in exposing the crimes we have, all, always known were occurring just outside the field of our vision. In the current and in future novels, the author will be chronicling the exploits of this skilled and resourceful pair, assisted by a most interesting supporting cast of characters, each with unique spirits and fascinating backgrounds of their own, and all working in their strangely juxtaposed roles, to expose/conceal the hidden activities of the criminal underworld as it exists within the large organizations currently controlling the destiny of America and the planet.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And I found it was related to several things: Content, connections, blogging, social networking and a few other factors.Interestingly, Google shifted their algorithm and changed some of the factors. The SEO kings were sent spinning as their one-dimensional solutions fell off the ranking algorithms.But my website did fine.

Andrews is an American born physician who graduated from the University of Bologna Medical School in Italy in 1970. After training in general surgery, neurosurgery, and aerospace medicine, he accepted the position as an emergency room director in a New Jersey hospital. In the late 1970s he entered private practice in California and later wrote a popular series of articles on health care for the Bakersfield Californian. Other articles and comments of his have appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Bergen Record, and Private Practice. While in practice he developed \"Drop-in-Laboratory Services\" to make access to medical care easier and less costly for the migrant workers that comprised a large portion of his patients. Lured back to Italy by medieval castles and the opera at La Scala in 1984, Dr. Andrews worked ten years for the state health system. He was the first physician to participate in the then newly established Italian emergency hot-line system. After twenty-five years of medical practice on two continents, and with the regrettable certainty that patient care has taken a back seat to bureaucracy and to the questionable tactics of some of his colleagues both here and abroad, in 1995 he accepted a position with the United States Public Health Service and was a director of a Navajo clinic on their reservation in northeastern Arizona. He was also director of the clinic's Emergency Medical Services, and a director of the National Native American Emergency Medical Services Association. Dr. Andrews is presently retired and passes his time writing, building model ships, and driving his modified Jeep and camper off-road in the Arizona desert with his wife, Jennifer.", "related": [], "rank": 2137646, "title": "How to Be a Patient and Live to Tell the Tale!

It is a story of overnight riches among railway stock speculators, appalling misery among the people who actually built the railways, the navvies, and a handful of the super rich who created the largest businesses the world had ever known, larger in proportion to the economy of the time than the internet is today.     There were also the very few who managed to struggle their way through the mud and deadly accidents of their daily working lives as navvies to become some of the richest and most influential men of their time.The Iron Beastis about such a man. Like the railways he builds, John Samuelson is made of iron, an iron determination and belief in his own mission and vast wealth. But buried in Samuelson's past is a deadly secret which could destroy everything he values. When he is threatened by a young school teacher, he cannot restrain himself from striking out, before his empire is toppled,  and before he loses the love of the one woman he has ever wanted, a beautiful, gifted pianist who rises to the god-like level of Franz Liszt, one of the greatest musicians of all time. What role will she play in Samuelson's triumph or failure?The Iron Beastis the thrilling tale of an age that will never come again, an age that echoes in our thoughts each time we ride the trains of today.", "related": ["B00G5J536G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Too many times I’ve seen travelers struggling and cursing as they realize they’ve brought three times what they should. Packing light, never checking--those are my goals. Of course, books always have contributed their pounds and I’m sure my outside pockets always will be stuffed with paperbacks. But as everyone knows by now, eBooks are a boon for those who are determined to fly like the wind out of airports and into hotels. If you are heading to Italy soon, I recommend loadingFodor’s Florence and Central Italy. On the flight over, you can settle into your no-doubt very cozy seat and transport early to the magical country that awaits you. The guide’s excellent portfolio of photographs will set you dreaming and the inviting check lists of top attractions can steer you toward the best that the region has to offer.As soon as I reviewed the guide’s hotel recommendations in Florence, I knew I could trust the straightforward advice. Since I’ve lived in Tuscany for over twenty years, I’ve traversed the span of the book’s coverage many times and can vouch for their choices. I like their approaches to a place, too. For instance, they recommend starting your visit to Florence at Piazzale Michelangelo. This is a brilliant suggestion because from that hill top vantage, you see all of Florence spread below you, which gives an instant orientation. They suggest timing your walk to Piazzale Michelangelo at sunset. You’ll thank the authors for this, as you gaze for the first time at Florence bathed in a glowing, lambent light.Several recommended focus trips are hard to choose among: wine tasting in Chianti, discovering Cinque Terre, hiking in the footsteps of Saint Francis (I’d like to do that), sampling Umbrian truffles, or just experiencingdolce far niente, the sweetness of doing nothing. I find that’s what most of my guests end up liking the most. Perhaps they take a jaunt to see the Piero della Francesca paintings, spend the day absorbing Siena or Lucca, but by evening the lure of the serene landscape, the cork popping from a Super Tuscan, a feast under the stars, and a late stroll through the piazza for gelato--those mellow activities spell Tuscany and Umbria.My favorite section ofFlorence and Central Italyis “Introducing Rome.” Rome is decidedlynotTuscany or Umbria, but it makes sense to include Rome in any guide to Italy, since all roads--and flight paths--do lead there. Rome can seem overwhelming but the plans and maps in this book make it accessible. A couple of days following the good suggestions here and you’ll realize what a big and friendly village Rome actually is. You need a lifetime to know Rome but in a few well-planned days you can store a lifetime of memories. As in Florence, the guide directs you to the best starting point, the Campidoglio, command central for the Roman Empire and later redesigned by Michelangelo. Yourprimoview there is from the arcades below the Senatorio building. The museum café also has a grand view toward St. Peter’s. Onward to the Forum, the Colosseum. . . Rome is, after all, the eternal city. At the end of a day, your feet will know that because it is one of the great walking cities of the world. On some lovely rooftop terrace, shoes off, with a glass of something cold in your hand, you can openFlorence and Central Italyand plot your next day.--Frances Mayes", "related": ["B0079M50QQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mom had been very sick and her dying was almost understandble; at least she wouldn't be in pain any longer. My father, however, was in good shape and seemed to be doing well. Just to prove that looks can be deceiveing, I found him dead in his bed one morning holding onto mama's pillow. It had been exactly five weeks. They were both  82 years old and had never loved anyone else. They had been together since they were 17 years old. I watched them make it thru tragedy after tragedy, never heard them complain and amazingly, I never even relaized we had less than others until I was in my teens. I took the fictional character of a wife and mother who cares for nothing more than her family, took all of that away and watched her struggle to find herself again. It is a journey each of us will have to take someday, for tragedy and loss will find us all in some form or another. It is a journey always taken alone and it can bring heartbreak long before it brings joy. But the joy is always worth it.", "related": ["B00AGBHGV4"], "rank": 1551384, "title": "Back To Me eBook", "author": "Tricia Thurman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During 11 years of ecological field work in northern Alaska, the author mingled with wild apes -- bush bums, redneck renegades, sourdoughs, societal dropouts, homesteaders, end-of-the-roaders, crusaders, nudists, Arctic explorers, adventure racers, trappers, goldminers, baseball aficionados, mushers, bohemians, and even fellow ecologists. These diverse humans share a sense of bold adventure, a healthy disrespect for mainstream values, and an esthetic appreciation for the vast wild lands. Their grit, unconventional lifestyle, and worldview make them ideal characters. These Arctic apes are not just wacky and colorful. They're wild.When the author wasn't face to face with apes, he was having close encounters with other charismatic creatures, including bears, muskoxen, wolves, moose, and \"Earth's Best Bird.\" Some of these encounters were of the adrenaline-spiking variety. All of them were thrilling.You're invited to tag along on a series of bumpy rides with a semi-feral ecologist. His stories convey the steroidal nature of the far north. They describe life in a bush village, the adventure of conducting field work in the Brooks Range, his solitary sojourn, and the lives of extreme yet ordinary Alaskans.", "related": ["B00KVP433Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She's not!\"No one in the Palmer family ever thought Jodie was ready. She sat on her bed, struggling to raise her left arm high enough to push her hand through the strap on her summery, sparkly, brand–new tank top. The hand wouldn't go, which meant she couldn't start the long journey down the stairs to join the Fourth of July family barbecue as the—not her idea—guest of honor.She pushed again, the feeble muscle refusing to obey the muddy signal from her brain. It was noon; time for everyone to start arriving. \"So I guess they're right. I'm not ready,\" she muttered, but she knew this wasn't what her sister Lisa's comment had meant.It had meant Not Ready, capitalN,capitalR,and during Jodie's twenty–nine years had covered everything from her learning the shocking truth about the Easter Bunny at the age of seven, to going out on her first date at fifteen. She vaguely remembered from last summer, about a hundred years ago, that Elin had even questioned her readiness to see Orlando Bloom's wedding photos in a magazine—and, admittedly, she had been a little envious of the bride.What wasn't she ready for this time?It could be anything. Going back to work?Well, yes, she knew she wouldn't be doing that for a while, since she managed and taught at a riding barn for a living and spent hours in the saddle every week at Oakbank Stables.Reading the police report on the accident scene? Might never be ready for that one. Fixing her own coffee? Wrong, sisters. She'd been practicing in rehab and, not to sound arrogant or anything, she wasdynamitewhen it came to spooning the granules out of the jar.\"Guys?\" she called out to her sisters. \"Can I have some help up here?\"From down on the deck she heard an exclamation, voices, the scrape of chairs. Lisa and Elin both appeared half a minute later, flinging the bedroom door back on its hinges with a slam, wearing frightened looks to complement their red–white–and–blue patriotic earrings.\"It's okay,\" she told them. \"You can put the defibrillator down and cancel the 911 call. I just can't get my arm into this top, that's all, and I know people will start arriving any second.\"\"Maddy and John just drove up,\" Lisa confirmed. \"And Devlin was right behind them.\"\"Devlin's coming?\" Jodie's heart bumped sideways against her ribs. Dev. Every time she saw Dev…There was an odd little silence. Possibly there was. It ended so quickly that she wasn't even sure if it had happened.\"He's been so great, hasn't he?\" Lisa said brightly. \"How many times did he go in to see you, while you were in the hospital?\"\"You tell me,\" Jodie joked. \"I was unconscious for most of them.\"\"Do you remember anything from that time?\" Elin asked, hesitant. At forty, she was the eldest of the four Palmer girls, and managed to be both the bossiest and the most nurturing at the same time. \"The doctors said you might retain some memories, even from when you weren't responsive.\"She and Lisa both stood there waiting for her reply, each almost holding their breath. Jodie fought a bad–tempered impulse to yell at them to stop the heck worrying about her so much!Instead she said carefully, \"I wouldn't call them memories… \"\"No…?\" prompted Lisa.\"But let's not talk about it now. Help me downstairs. I'm so slow. My brain sends the instructions but bits of my body don't respond. I'm thrilled I managed to get into the jeans.\"Thirty–eight–year–old Lisa, sister number two, hugged Jodie suddenly with a warm, tight squeeze, and planted a smacking kiss on her cheek. Of the four Palmer girls, she and Jodie were physically the most alike, blonde and athletic, outdoorsy and lean. Lisa liked tennis and the beach and it had started to show in her tanned skin. She didn't take care of it the way she should. Hugging her back, Jodie decided she'd have to give Lisa a sisterly lecture about that, soon, because Palmer overprotectiveness could cut both ways.The slight, strange tension in the room seemed to have gone, chased by the hug. \"Honey, forget slow, we're just so happy you're okay,\" Lisa said. \"Talking. Walking. Getting better every day.Homer\"I know.\" Jodie blinked back sudden tears as they let each other go. \"Me, too.\"Devlin Browne was standing on the deck when she reached it, his dark hair showing reddish glints in the sun, his body tall and strong; there was no evidence of the accident that had injured the two of them in such different ways, nine months ago. He grinned at the sight of her, from behind his sunglasses. \"Look at you!\" She wished she could see the expression in his blue eyes. He ran his life with such quiet confidence and certainty. She loved that about him, wished right now that some of his qualities would rub off on her.\"Yeah,\" she drawled in reply, \"all the grace of a ballerina.\"With a walking frame for a dance partner. The doctors and therapists had promised that if she worked hard, she'd be rid of it soon. She planned to astonish them with her progress.\"Don't knock it,\" Dev said. \"Compared to how you were even a week ago.\"\"I know. I'm not knocking it, believe me.\" She felt so self–conscious in his presence, so aware of the strong length of his body. Nine months and more since those three explosive nights of lovemaking, but to her they felt like yesterday. The way their bodies seemed to fit together so perfectly. The smell of him, warm and fresh and male. The words he'd whispered to her in the dark, naked and blunt and charged with sensual heat. Did he ever think about it?Lisa helped her to sit down and took away the frame, while Elin handed her an ice–cold glass of tropical juice. The deck was dappled with sun and shade, and there was a breeze. It was a perfect day. Dev pulled up an Adirondack chair to sit beside her. He leaned against the wooden seat–back, casually stretched his arms. But his mood wasn't as casual as he wanted her to think. His gaze seemed intently focused behind those concealing sunglasses, and she didn't know if his sitting so close was significant.Were they dating?Could she ask?Um, excuse me, Dev, I was in a coma for nearly eight months, and rehab since. Can you just catch me up on the current status of our relationship?A thought struck her. That Not Ready comment of Lisa's a few minutes ago.Not Ready to hear that Dev had moved on to someone else?But she didn't have time to examine the cold pit that opened deep in her stomach at this idea. There shouldn't be a pit! He'd been up front with her nine months ago. \"I have nothing to offer, Jodie,\" he'd said. \"I'm only here until Dad is ready to go back to work. My career is in New York, it's pretty full–on, no room for commitment, and I'm not looking for it. I really like being with you, but if you're interested in something long–term, it's not with me.\"How did a woman respond to something like that? She knew Dev had said it out of innate honesty and goodness of heart. He wasn't the kind of man who promised what he couldn't deliver, or tricked a woman into bed with sweet–talking lies. He called it how he saw it, and when he laid his cards on the table, he laid them straight.Nine months ago he'd been all about the short term, about saying goodbye when it was over, with a big grin, warm wishes and no regrets for either of them, yet now he was sitting beside her, searching her face, examining the set of her shoulders as if he cared that she might not be coping.Which she wasn't, fully.Everything was happening too fast. Dev stood up to greet Lisa's husband. Mom and Dad came out from the kitchen, Dad in full male barbecue armor, with plastic apron and an impressive weaponry of implements. The front doorbell rang and Elin went to answer it.And sister number three—Maddy—and her husband, John, were here, having at last managed to negotiate the trip from their car. They'd come around the side of the house and climbed the steps to the deck carrying two bulging diaper bags, some kind of squishy portable baby gym and a baby in a carrier.Their baby. Their little girl. Tiny. Just a few weeks old. Jodie hadn't even known Maddy was pregnant. She'd only been told about baby Lucy after she was born—another questionable instance of Not Ready— and hadn't seen her yet, because Maddy and John lived in Cincinnati, two hours from Leighville, the Palmer family's Southern Ohio hometown.\"Oh, she's asleep!\" Mom crooned. \"Oh, what an angel! She already looks so much bigger than she did two weeks ago.\"\"Can we put her somewhere quiet?\" Maddy asked.But it was too late. The baby began to waken, stretching her little body in the cramped space of the car carrier and letting out a keening cry.\"Oh, she needs a feed,\" Maddy said. \"Where shall I go?\"\"Not here,\" Dad said. He was a traditional man, with a passion for woodworking and gadgetry. In his world, feeding and diaper changes didn't belong in the same space as a barbecue.\"You wouldn't believe how difficult it was just to get here, all the gear we had to bring. John, can you set up some pillows for me in? Oh, where!\"\"My room,\" Jodie said quickly. \"There's a heap of pillows, and fresh flowers, and a rocking chair.\"\"Oops, I'm going to have to change her first…\" But John had already gone to ready the room. Maddy held Lucy with the baby's legs awkwardly dangling and her little ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rather, this book is a probing exploration of the methodological and interpretive difficulties associated with Greek religion from the eighth through the second centuries BCE. . . . This work provides a wealth of insights from one of the leading experts in the field. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\"—Choice(October 2011)\"On Greek Religion has all the virtues we have come to appreciate in his writings: a fruitful blend of the factual and theoretical; a simultaneous inclination towards and distrust of categories, schemes, and generalities; scrupulous attention to detail; an awareness of what we do and do not and cannot know about Greek religion; precise and generous but not uncritical discussions of others' views; the integration of literary and epigraphical sources; common sense; and a lively style with touches of whimsy.\"—Jon D. Mikalson,The Classical Journal(CAMWS) (Fall 2011)\"This book derives from the Townsend Lectures given by Parker at Cornell in 2008, but its style is not noticeably different from that of Parker's two previous books . . . . Its scope is wider than those two works, both chronologically, dealing with material from the eighth to the second century BC, and geographically, covering the entire Greek world. Its ambition is also greater, in that its seven chapters and five appendices aim to provide an interpretation of Greek religion as a whole. . . . This is a very important book that everyone working in the field of Greek religion will have to read.\"—Hugh Bowden,The Journal of Hellenic Studies(November 2012)\"This book is an important step in its author's scholarly journey in the field of ancient Greek religion…. This work is outstandingly well-informed, well-written, clever and also very cautious.\"—Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Bryn Mawr Classical Review (March 2012)\"[Parker's] vast knowledge of the documentary evidence for Greek religion makes this essay instructive and persuasive while the questions he proposes offer challenging perspectives on the nature of the Greek religious experience. This essay will be useful to scholars of ancient religion seeking to reassess the milestones of scholarship in the field and to explore complex theoretical and theological questions relating to Greek religion.\"—Marie-Claire Beaulieu, Tufts University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each occupation has pages of details about the tasks involved as well as photos of workers fulfilling their duties. The Victorians and Edwardians worked hard, but as evidenced in \"At Play\", they played just as hard. They enjoyed many of the same activities we do today, such as trips to the zoo and the races, a game of golf  or hunting, roller skating and even enjoying their pint of beer. Both books have a wealth of beautifully tinted vintage photographs and more details about their lives than you could have imagined!

Or nick/borrow it! John Harris, The Guardian Guy Standing provides an incisive account of how precariousness is becoming the new normality in globalised labour markets, and offers important guidelines for all concerned to build a more just society. Richard Hyman, London School of Economics, UK This is an important book. Citizen's Income Newsletter This important and original book brings out the political dangers, so clear in contemporary America, of failing to address the insecurities of the Precariat. It also suggests the way forward: a reconstruction of the concept of work. Eileen Applebaum, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington DC, USA Over 90% of workers in India are informal, poorly paid, without any economic security. Guy Standing combines vision with practicality in outlining policies that are urgently needed to provide security to workers such as these around the world. Renana Jhabvala, Self-Employed Women's Association of India Standing has produced a well-informed and important book investigating, for the first time in a comprehensive way, the direction in which global economic security is moving in the 21st century. The book is packed with statistics presented in a very readable form and drawing on extensive published research. It is a compelling account of economic insecurity... Work Organisation, Labour and Globalisation [T]here is much in The Precariat to recommend it to labor educators, labor studies scholars, and activists of all sorts...a book that provides a clear and detailed understanding of how the situation of precarious employment affects the lives of the \"precariat\" individually, collectively, day to day, and over the longer term. This is the book's greatest value. Standing does this with many international examples, even though his main intellectual base is in Britain. His analysis of the impact of precarity, along with the diversity of examples from around the world, makes this the primary book on the topic to date. -- Joe Berry, Coalition of Contingent Academic Labor, Berkeley, CA Labor Studies Journal In summary, the analysis and arguments are compelling, for The Precariat brings together and develops many current strands of thought within the (social science) literature, and builds on the materialist tradition which ultimately leads to a rejection of 'neoliberalism'. Standing captures some of the collectivist social policy tradition established by Richard Titmuss, but with more attention to all forms of work and notions of occupational citizenship...The social policy community needs to engage more with issues at stake here, making The Precariat essential reading. -- Chris Deeming Journal of Social Policy", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This breakthrough series has found thousands of readers from all of these genres, many of whom praise the series for its exceptional world-building, believable characters, well-paced action, steamy eroticism, and heart-melting love stories. There are currently five books in the series, with the sixth, \"The Vulpirans' Honor,\" slated for release in Fall 2012.  The series is expected to consist of at least seven novels. All novels in the series are only for adult readers who are not offended by explicit sexuality.  Phillips was born in San Bernardino, California and now lives in Northwest Arizona where she is the manager of a small professional office. She has had a number of careers, such as running a medical billing office and working for years as a technical writer, including writing software user manuals. Her lifelong ambition, however, has been to be a novelist, a dream which has recently come to fruition with the publication of the first five novels of \"The Soul-Linked Saga\": \"The Dracons' Woman\" in October 2011, \"The Lobos' HeartSong\" in November of that same year, \"The Katres' Summer\" in January 2012, \"The Bearens' Hope\" in March, and \"The Gryphons' Dream\" in May of the same year.  \"The Soul-Linked Saga\" was born in a discussion over lunch at Denny's with her husband, in which Laura sketched the broad outlines of the series and enlisted his help with the science fiction and military/political elements, a lively (and, according to Laura, \"fun\") collaboration which continues through the series. Based on the popularity her work is enjoying, Laura is leaving office work to concentrate on her writing. Phillips plans several more novels in the \"Soul-Linked Saga\" and looks forward to spending many years travelling with her readers through the fascinating universe of \"The Thousand Worlds\" which she and her husband have created.

Much to his youngest sister’s dismay the story was a hit and became the first story of a series all dealing with the planets that were destroyed by his siblings and their strange quirks and body odors.  Vic moved on to horror stories and then to stories about his friends.  Always one who pushed the edge of convention, it wasn’t long or much of a shock, before he was writing interracial historical romances.  However, Vic realized that his heroes seemed much happier when they were hanging out with other guys and that was when he discovered the M/M genre. Vic now enjoys writing about shifters, humanoids, cowboys, firemen, rent boys, fairies, elves, dancers, doctors, Doms, Subs, and anything else that catches his fancy, all sexy men falling in love with each other and having lots of naughty, dirty, man-on-man sex.  He already has two books published about shape-shifting cowboys, a dancer and a cross-dresser: Unthinkable and Inconceivable, books One and Two of The Tate Pack Series.  Vic is a huge fan of the “happily-ever-after” ending but while his characters all ride off into the proverbial sunset, all sexually satisfied and in love, they all bear the scars of fighting for that love, just like in real life.  No fluff writer here, Vic’s stories can be slightly gritty, dark and hard hitting, but the reason for that, is that love is sweeter when it’s been fought for and won. Never satisfied with only one genre, every book that Vic writes falls into more than one category and has each main character experiencing more than one orgasm. Out and proud, Vic does not believe that love only comes in one form, one race, one gender and that not only is gender fluid, by sexuality as well.  Vic loves to make people laugh and when he’s not writing, or rather, procrastinating in writing, he’s reading, playing the Sims 3, hanging out with his very supportive adopted family, being distracted from his writing by his partner Daniel and drooling over pictures of John Barrowman and Shemar Moore behind Daniel’s back.", "related": ["B00LJ843A0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.7778, "rating_total": 34.0}

They wrote “Navigating Autism” because they were not able to find a book to guide them when Kennedy was diagnosed with autism in 2005.  They were still struggling to get the assistance she needed when Alex was diagnosed on the spectrum in 2006 and Bella in 2008.  Andrew Areffi said that he and his wife decided to write their own “how-to” book to make it easier and quicker for parents to find their way through the system.  “We wrote the book that we wanted to read when Kennedy was diagnosed,” explains Andrew. Since Kennedy’s diagnosis, the Areffis have consulted with parents, schools, therapy companies, large corporations and city governments about the impact of autism on families.  They work tirelessly to support parents of autistic children, “We want to help as many people as possible,” says Melissa.  “With early intervention, these kids can go on to become anything, and not dependent on disability services their entire lives.  As parents, we want our kids to have a shot at happiness, and a ‘normal’ life.  We figured we didn’t have any right to complain about how things are unless we did something about it to help.” The Areffis met when they were both students at Cal State University, San Bernardino.  Now married for 16 years, the Areffis live in Toluca Lake, Calif.  They are both professionals in the entertainment industry:  Melissa as a location manager and scout; Andrew in project development for both film and television.  Together, they are a feature writing team and their current feature-film project, “Booth,” based on the 12 days John Wilkes Booth spent on the run after the Lincoln assassination, is in pre-production. Information about “Navigating Autism” and the Areffis can be found online at the book’s official website – www.NavAutism.com – in addition to social networking sites at Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest.", "related": [], "rank": 2904235, "title": "Navigating Autism: The Essential How to", "author": "Andrew J Areffi", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some dishes were cooked during week days, like Baked Rice (more humble\nand affordable meal), some others on most of the Sundays and special occasions,\nlike Valencian Paella, or mainly during summer holidays, like Seafood Paella. These are the exact ways the different Paella variations are\ntraditionally cooked in Valencia (Spain) and its surrounding counties. Second, because of the quality time I spent with my mom\nwriting them down and trying to tell the story behind each recipe. I liked how\nenthusiastic she was about it. For her, Internet is an unknown world and,\nknowing that her recipes could be reached from anywhere in the Planet she was\nreally excited. If you are interested in traditions and cooking, with some\ninterest and patience you can taste at home the flavor of Paella as it's cooked\nat the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Wishing you to enjoy the good family time I had around these\nmeals. Maria Brull.", "related": ["B00DGK8AQM"], "rank": 789945, "title": "The 7 Most Traditional Paella Recipes: The Way It Has Been Cooked At Home For Generations In Valencia (Spain)", "author": "Maria Brull", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.3125, "rating_total": 69.0}

But the genre is far older than that. The template was created by Samuel Pepys in the 1660s, though it was not until the 19th century that anyone cracked the code of his shorthand and discovered the glory of it -- Matthew Engel Financial Times Diaries are the most intimate historical source, and Ruth Winstone has brilliantly welded together the best of them into a compellingly seductive narrative. We learn of ambition and vanity, of folly and brilliance, of friendship and rivalry, of the law of unintended consequences, and the cumulative effect is like a great rolling novel. Political history has never been so palatable -- David Kynaston A great Christmas gift Bookseller Ruth Winstone's edited volume of diary entries provides a fascinating and original series of insights into modern Britain, spanning the years from Lloyd George's coalition of 1918 to that of 2012. Its miscellany of vignettes, drawn from intellectuals and figures from the arts as well as politicians, illuminates vividly the pieces from which the mosaic of British twentieth-century history was constructed -- Kenneth O Morgan This collection is a delight from beginning to end. There's a gem on almost every page. Such a volume is a great idea, hugely enhanced by Ruth Winstone's brilliant eye -- Peter Hennessy A vivid and vital chronicle of our recent political past, culled from the pages of Britain's greatest twentieth-century diarists, who were there at the time and saw history happen. It is an enthralling read, full of old friends and new acquaintances, and there is no other book like it! -- David Cannadine Fascinating -- Matthew Engel Financial Times A bright idea -- Simon Hoggart Guardian Dipping into Events, Dear Boy, Events and matching one's own recollections of an \"Event\", especially one in which one was a participant, with those of bystanders at the same event is an almost surreal experience.

In this work Mr.Yahia has stripped away the James Bond Supervillain image of USA and CIA, showing the roots of CIA twisted psychology in a radical reading of the USA history. This book and the world it uncovers is far more frightening than any thriller. A superb work, highly recommended. --Time USAAs an Investigatire journalist I am always interested in these true stories, I suppose I am sceptical of most. Having done some background work on the CIA, rendition flights and covert prisons, I am convinced that what this man has said in his book is true. It has long been the policy of the American administraion be it Bush's or other, to deny first and then admit the truth, it will therefore not be too long, a year or so until everything contained in The Black Hole will be confirmed. I myself made a few enquiries to the Austrian government and the CIA with regards to this book, not surprisingly they made No Comment which in itself is an indication that they are aware of his existence. As for the author's motives, well yes it is a great read and maybe he will sell a ton of books, but he seems to be donating his profits to a children's hospital so maybe money isn't the goal, maybe just to be heard is. --Austria News.An exceptionally well written book! Latif Yahia Really is becoming a IRAQI Institution, somebody for us to be proud of. Well balanced thoughtful, and giving a human touch to the most ghastly face of human kind, War Against CIA. Keep on writing Mr.Yahia, your insights are fresh, detailed, and full of insight. You never balk in pointing out the daft decisions made by politicians and the CIA, who obviously think that Joe Public will suck in and digest their propoganda without question. --Irish TimeAs an Investigatire journalist I am always interested in these true stories, I suppose I am sceptical of most.

Latif Yahia Really is becoming a IRAQI Institution, somebody for us to be proud of. Well balanced thoughtful, and giving a human touch to the most ghastly face of human kind, War Against CIA. Keep on writing Mr.Yahia, your insights are fresh, detailed, and full of insight. You never balk in pointing out the daft decisions made by politicians and the CIA, who obviously think that Joe Public will suck in and digest their propoganda without question. --Irish Time", "related": ["B009RYCHT2"], "rank": 462683, "title": "The Black Hole, This book is a sequel to The Devil's Double, which was made into a feature film of the same name.

I explain how you can buy gold coins, but also how to invest in gold by buying mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).Since I focus on investing topics, I thought it would also be helpful to explain why gold is a good vehicle to diversify your investments.  I also thought it is important to sort the myth from the fact about whether gold is a good investment or not.  Read The Easy Way To Invest In Gold, and see if holding gold is s right for you.", "related": ["B009MRLVEQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sometimes with a touch of humor, sometimes with a little sorrow, always with passion and emotion. My latest books are a two-book contemporary romance series, Wolves in Business.  Wolf in Jester’s Clothing and Wolf on Thin Ice tell the story of two brothers who find their true loves where they least expect them.  Warning: These are NOT shapeshifters, but alpha businessmen.  Like the Magic Series, it’s best to read them in order. My award-winning Magic Series is about a group of people who can cast spells to help them with their everyday jobs. Wouldn't you like to have an ability that would help you type faster, make accurate change, fix the plumbing, or grow flowers and vegetables? Or whatever it is that you do? And these people, who call themselves practitioners, are guaranteed to find their soul mates. Ready or not, and whether or not they want one at that particular moment. As the series progresses, the magic gets more complicated and so do the relationships. Included in the series now are the last two stories, never before published. Windswept won the Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Award for Best Romance, Small Press, 2008, and several other awards. Writing this standalone contemporary with a historical twist took me back to my first love, the study of history, and it definitely shows off my Texas roots. There's a terrible secret in the papers of the Windswept Plantation . . . I'm a native Gulf Coast Texan, now living in The Frozen North of Chicagoland. I started life reading mysteries, then sci-fi and fantasy. When I discovered romances, I saw a way to combine all the aspects of books that I liked into my own stories. And what a welcome difference from writing computer manuals--my old job and which has no magic about it at all. Let me know what you think of my stories. Contact me either at ann@AnnMacela.com or AnnMacela@msn.com P.S. Those of you interested in how my magic works, check out the article, A Theory of Magic, on my website.", "related": ["B00AR6ZB60"], "rank": 1200851, "title": "Wolf in Jester's Clothing (Wolves in Business Book 1)", "author": "Ann Macela", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Such an inquisitive nature stood him in good stead for a career in Technology and managing Technology in a multinational Investment bank.  Through peers, staff, children (sometime these are hard to separate) and the particular culture of New Zealand, Ken's ability to work through issues and find resolutions without pursuing conflict lead him to believe in \"cool management\". Further work in training horses cemented this belief that anger should only ever be used in simulation rather than to pass your \"remote control\" to the red mist. This is a lesson which gets swiftly learned from a 500kg Thoroughbred at the end of a 12 foot rope.  Ken's love has always been tools. The learning, using and delivering of tasks and goals with tools was something he excelled in doing. From the early day of taking vintage car restoration classes to help renovate his Morris 1000, through holiday jobs making masts, or working in civil construction on the way to his BSc, these early forays into using tools made clear the ultimate tool was the computer. Later on in life it became more and more clear the most effective 'tool' was your mind, and the minds of others.  Ken hopes you enjoy his books and wishes you every success in finding your passion in life, and its doorway into your own mind.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One thing had run through\nhis mind since he'd heard David's voice. He couldn't wait to see David's\nperfect body naked and strapped to his cross again, or maybe they could strap\nGeorgia to it. David could fuck her while he fucked David and then later they\ncould both take Georgia together.Gavin wanted to\nsee David covered in sweat, his magnificent body glistening, touch his smooth\ncreamy ass cheeks, caress them with his hands after each smack turned the\ncreamy flesh a lovely glowing red. David used to cry out with each swat,\nletting Gavin know how much he enjoyed it. Gavin used to love feeling David\nbent over his lap, his cock growing hard as he waited for each swat to land on\nhis ass. He loved the feel of David's full pink lips circling the head of his\ncock and the heat of his mouth as he sucked him deep and hard. Even David's\ntaste had been exquisite.\"Why don't I get\nrid of these people and introduce you to Georgia?\"David made himself\nat home while Gavin made his way through the crowd of people who were invading\nhis penthouse. He thanked them for coming and told them he was really tired and\njust wanted the party to end. Everyone actually seemed as relieved to leave as\nGavin was to see them go, which made him wonder why they'd even agreed to come\nin the first place. Maybe it was just to be able to see inside his penthouse.\nIt was the first time any of his neighbors had been there, and he was sure it\nwould also be their last. He wasn't worried about what they saw. Most of his\npenthouse was just that, a house. He kept his private life behind the locked\ndoors.David smiled at\nhim as he held a glass up in salute to Gavin once the last guest was escorted\nout the door. Gavin stopped in front of Georgia, lifting her lips to his. He\ncaressed his lips across them to let her know he was pleased with her for not\nletting anyone know anything about their relationship. He gave her\ninstructions, and then Gavin joined David on the couch as Georgia poured him a\ntall glass of bourbon on the rocks. She made her way to the couch, head bowed\nas she stood before him glass in hand.\"Thank you, pet.\nRaise your head and let my friend David see your lovely face.\"Georgia raised her\nhead to look at Gavin first. When he nodded she turned her face toward David.\"Very pretty,\"\nDavid said. \"Is she into threesomes?\"Gavin felt almost\na little disappointed. He had hoped to have David to himself for at least a\nlittle while. Perhaps Paris had changed David. Maybe he was no longer into men.\nThat indeed would be a disappointment since David was so good at what he did in\nthe bedroom department.\"Georgia is into\nanything I tell her she's into, isn't that so pet?\"\"Yes, Master.\" She\nanswered sweetly with just a hint of pink tinting her cheeks as she lowered her\nhead once more.\"She looks excited\nand a little flushed about the idea. I think she just might be into the idea of\nhaving both of us.\" David smiled.\"What about you,\nDavid,\" Gavin turned his head to look at the other man. \"What are you into\nthese days?\"\"Don't worry so,\nGavin,\" David turned his head to look at him. \"I still want to please you in\nevery way I can. I just thought we'd enjoy a woman between us first.\"\"I'm pleased to\nknow some things haven't changed.\"", "related": ["B00F2NMV5C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Because of overwhelming response from the mathematical community, the project now occupies over 1000 pages, arranged into two volumes. These volumes contain both high level research articles as well as key articles that survey some of the cornerstones of Erdős' work, each written by a leading world specialist in the field. A special chapter \"Early Days\", rare photographs, and art related to Erdős complement this striking collection. A unique contribution is the bibliography on Erdős' publications: the most comprehensive ever published. This new edition, dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Paul Erdős' birth, contains updates on many of the articles from the two volumes of the first edition, several new articles from prominent mathematicians, a new introduction, more biographical information about Paul Erdős, and an updated list of publications.The first volume contains the unique chapter \"Early Days\", which features personal memories of Paul Erdős by a number of his colleagues. The other three chapters cover number theory, random methods, and geometry. All of these chapters are essentially updated, most notably the geometry chapter that covers the recent solution of the problem on the number of distinct distances in finite planar sets, which was the most popular of Erdős' favorite geometry problems.", "related": [], "rank": 1764792, "title": "Jaroslav Nešetřil", "author": "Ronald L.

From an early age, I was taught that if you followed the rules and worked hard you'd be able to be successful. So, that's what I did. I worked extremely hard up through and including medical school and into residency. It seemed that everything was going great, but something in the back of my head kept telling me that even though I was, in fact, successful, that maybe I was missing something. Then it came: the email I received as a second year resident from the wife of one of my friends from back in college, saying that he had been killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq. I was floored. My friend had done everything right, and everything I was trying to do: he'd studied hard, worked his tail off, and served his country and now he was gone. What, then, was I doing spending countless hours doing inane scut work (busy work) when I could be gone tomorrow? Fast forward a few years to my experience in Afghanistan. During the intervening years from my friend's death to my \"vacation\", I'd experimented here and there with trying to increase my efficiency. Towards the end of residency, I actually started to succeed, being able to leave the hospital between 4 and 4:30 PM most days. My colleagues were amazed and I tried to help them out too as much as possible so that they could also live a life outside the hospital. Now, though, I found myself in Afghanistan and with 3 young boys at home, and I knew that I needed to make some major changes, take back my time, and take back my life in order to honor the memory of my friend and to truly be able to enjoy each and every day with my family. I made the changes, working first on changing my outlook, then hiring the right personnel to offload those tasks I wasn't passionate about, and leveraged technology in order to maximize my personal efficiency. I'm now a father of four young boys (two in diapers!), husband, full time physician, entrepreneur, snowboarder, and mountain biker, and I do all of these things well. I've created the life I want, and now I'm here to help you do the same.  I applaud you for your efforts so far, and encourage you to \"stay the course\" until you've created the life you want.", "related": ["B00J6WZJIQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found this to be very helpful to do more in-depth research on any particular portion of the book.Managers, Martians & Monstersis an interesting and well-written self-help book that anyone can use to better themselves in the business world. It gives the reader some very important insights into the workings of big business.-Reader Views", "related": ["B008QJO3YQ"], "rank": 4385898, "title": "Managers, Martians & Monsters", "author": "Jonathan M.

An attractive and articulate television presence who has retained the looks which made her a supermodel in the late 60s/ early 70s, she  has over the years been a frequent contributor to all the major television channels on both sides of the Atlantic, including CNN, Fox TV, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese TV,  ITV and the BBC.  Her list of royal scoops is second to none. It was she who first revealed that Diana had an eating disorder; a psychiatric history; would be separated, then divorced; and would lose her royal title, amongst other firsts. She is frequently credited by publications worldwide with having written the best of all the Diana biographies, of which the following People Magazine quote is typical:  \"Some Palace watchers note that she has an impressive roster of well-placed contacts and credit her with writing the most believable Diana biography.\"  She lives with her two sons in London and frequently visits the south of France, where the family has a chateau. She is a noted dog and cat lover whom the journalist Lynn Barber said is \"the greatest gossip since Pepys\" and Jenny Johnson of the Daily Mail claims is \"the most entertaining person alive\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes cats are evil, and also detests dogs with a bitter passion--mainly because she'd been bitten over a dozen times on separate occasions by the rambunctious creatures in her formative years (she's got the scars to show!). A lover of all things 'romance', Ann has always been a writer of poetries and songs of any kind.

Her top list of people-obsession includes King Solomon, Anne Boleyn, Chris Brown, Jonathon Rhys Meyers... When she's not abusing her computer keyboard, you can find her nosing a novel, watching anything on television that makes her laugh out loud, studying the Bible, or nursing any of the three alcoholic beverages: Black Label and Coke, Heineken, or a glass of Merlot.", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 713763, "title": "Choose You (The Billionaire Brothers Series Book 3)", "author": "S.

I assembled them in small stories but was never quite able to find time to fashion them into a completed work. I decided to challenge myself to the task, completing this second novel, the first was Unlovely Letters. Surprising myself, I became a winner along with the woman in this novel “Unlovely Lives.” Now that I have retired, I continue to find time to write working around four rescue dogs and three cats. If you find me at home, I am probably tweaking details, or pondering plots. I am originally from the Edison Park, a suburb of Chicago and moved through the US on my way to Florida, where I have resided since 1971. My husband, two wonderful children and their families are my inspiration.

I'm married to a strong, intelligent and great looking man whose number one priority is to have my back. He rocks my world, and I love rocking his. We've had some pretty hot adventures together, which were the inspiration for my first books. Why do I write? I write for the same reason I love to read. Something happens and I'm swept away by the story. It didn't happen right away when I began my first story, but it happened pretty quickly. It's hard to describe... yes, I know, that's a bad thing for an author to say but it's true. I write because I can't not write. And I love it! ABOUT MY WRITING What can happen after Happy Ever After wears off? After the house is bought. The kids on the way. Bills start to pile up. Work gets harder. Sometimes... time slips by and we get 'caught up'. If the picket fence needs a coat of paint, if the car needs a new set of tires... oh for God's sake--if the sheets on the bed are getting a little worn at the edges... maybe some other stuff is too. I write about everyday couples that are living normal lives. They have jobs--some have professional careers, homes, some even have kids. They have full lives. But something's missing. And it used to be there, dammit. In my books, my characters explore questions like: \"How DO you fall for, get turned on again like you were first dating, but with someone who's been farting in your bed for the last five, ten, or more years?\" Re-ignite the spark? Not the 'I love you, here's some flowers' spark. Not the 'I love you, here's a bubble bath with candles' spark. Don't get me wrong- I love flowers and bubble baths too. I'm NOT talking about 'Date Night' either. Don't get me wrong--those are really important. Just hanging out with my husband is great. What I AM talking about here is something different than that. I'm talking about ((((THAT))) spark. The being wanted? No. The being desired? Nope. The being craved spark. Where your partner's not just thinking about you... but where your partner is obsessed by you. The early sex was awesome, wasn't it? That craving, and your craving being returned in spades. The kind of sex that stays with you for three days after. Those are the aspects of relationships I write about. The afterglow that lasts for three days. Or a week. So, what can happen after Happy Ever After? Happier Ever After. And, dear reader, that's what I write about.", "related": ["B008G07I06"], "rank": 317438, "title": "Swingers Club Box Set (First Time Hotwife Bisexual Menage Romance, First Time MM Bisexual Experience): All Four Episodes Value Priced!

I have taught these techniques to many people\nwith some extraordinary results. These techniques are not another\ngarden-variety sessions of meditation, self-hypnosis, mindfulness and such,\nmost of which are no more than relaxation techniques and put most people to\nsleep. The power of using \"mental tools\" is due to the fact that it leads to\nvery specific and very personalized solutions in the most effective manner and shortest\ntime possible. When you practice these techniques, your body's immune system shifts\ninto high gear immediately and responds with immense vigor. Additionally, you\nhave a \"solution\" to the problem - a way of perceiving and approaching your\nspecific type of pain, which you can apply repeatedly till such solution is embedded\nwithin your system, and you attain a higher level of well-being. I was always puzzled and somewhat\nsaddened that such simple, effective and elegant means of self-help are not\nwidely known or even published. Not anymore - my goal in writing this book,\nurged and cheered on by my family and friends, is to unlock these secrets for\nthe benefit of everyone. This is a labor of love for me, and not a get published\nquick scheme. I am sure that as more people learn and practice these secrets,\nthey will appreciate the forgotten wisdom of the 3000 year-old tradition called\n\"Tantra\", which seems to have originally proposed the use of such techniques. I\nbelieve that sooner or later, these techniques will inevitably sink into public\nconsciousness once again. While this book is not a lengthy\ntreatise, my goal is to teach the reader the core foundation of using active\nvisualization based on the \"mental tools\" techniques, which then can be applied\nin any number of pain management situations or for enhancing one's general\nwell-being. It is not intended as a \"Heal so and so in X steps in Y weeks\". Here's how to read this book to gain maximum value:\n  The\nbook lays the critical foundation through the Preface and Chapters 1 and 2.\nChapter 2 introduces the concept the \"Zone\", an effortless and trance-like\nstate of mind where your subconscious is actively working on your behalf in\nseeking healing solutions and their application, while you watch the play of the\nvisuals as a mere observer in a very relaxed state of being. Attaining this\nstate can do immense good for the practitioner at many levels. Chapter 2\ncontains details on how to achieve and remain in such state till you hit upon\nthe solution very specific to your problem. Such solutions begin to show\nresults almost immediately. More\nbroadly, this book is intended to teach you how to develop new solutions\nyourself (\"solution design\") by way of some case studies, which are presented\nin Chapter 4. The case studies not only discuss the solution design process for\nhealing, but also demonstrate the versatility of the techniques and the range\nof the possible solutions. The detailed analysis with some case studies must be\nconsidered an extension of the theory provided in Chapters 1 and 2. The root\ncause and the cure for some conditions (such as, costochondritis) are not\nwell-understood by the medical community, and therefore, serve as a perfect\ntesting ground for the techniques of this book. The\ncase studies covered in the book include the following conditions:   Sore\nthroat / Common cold, Headache, Stomach pain, Tennis elbow, Knee pain, Back\npain, Neck pain, Costochondritis, High Sugar, Toe injury. Chapter\n5 and the case studies therein provide insight into how to use the techniques\nof this book to rewire one's brain to enhance mental performance, and  channel energies towards financial planning,\novercome personality limitations and achieve life's goals.", "related": ["B00KOW20KC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She then meets up-and-coming race-car driver Sam, and quickly becomes attached to him, spending her weekends hanging out in his professional garage. John does not want to give her up, and threatens to tell Sam all about their affair. In the meantime, John’s wife divorces him and finds a new life. Their lives all intertwine through local criminal activity, and Sam falls prey to sabotage. Readers will be satisfied with the conclusions to the various plotlines in this fun story about two women finding independence and love. Best of all, Tate brings readers back to 1950s fashions and attitudes with entertaining detail in a novel that will delight fans of Mad Men and LaVyrle Spencer’s titles. --Amy Alessio", "related": [], "rank": 3618659, "title": "Games Lovers Play", "author": "June Tate", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not so in The Great Game, which gives equal attention to both and so creates a novel filled with action, intrigue, and the concerns of two persons who find themselves playing a game they never asked for or thought about. How do ordinary individuals become extraordinary? How can simple lives be changed by complicated circumstances? And how can even those with no special abilities rise to meet life-changing challenges from outside forces?  All these facets and more make The Great Game a satisfyingly-complex novel that engages the reader in just one battle of what will ultimately prove a greater war. Any who want a vivid, fast-paced adventure story will find its characters and action more than a cut above the ordinary.D.

He's been published in LA review of LA, Nine Line Anthology, and Afterwords. Born in the bubbling cauldron of Tanzania, where he picked up his first pen at the age of two and chewed. He's progressed much since then. He wrote his first story at 5, a knockoff of all the prince-saves-princess stories he'd read at the time. Life did not rest. It took him to India, then frigid Michigan. The shock, according to parent-sources, was a character building exercise. Lowhim, however, only remembered clenched fingers trying to write. Shorts about teen angst kept him going. Soon he was hitchhiking the mountainous American West where the outlaw locals kept his journal full of color. It wasn't long before he joined the US Army where the detritus of Babylon only furthered his literary ambitions. Iraq wasn't done with him. He would return, an engineer in 5th SFG. When he returned from this trip, he finished his first novel. Released upon the world, he attended Columbia University. He spent his free time writing and working with other authors. He graduated and has since been penning some of the most ambitious novels this side of that Pluto rock. Lowhim currently lives with his girlfriend in the Bronx.

What are the boundaries of their politics? And what decides whether they moderate or grow extreme? These are questions of great importance, which Shadi Hamid addresses inTemptations of Powerwith clarity and erudition. Hamid relies on his intimate experience with Islamist politics to provide an expansive picture of religious and political issues that are shaping the future of the Middle East. This book is a welcome contribution to the debate on the future of Islamism, one that all those interested in Middle East politics should read.\" --Vali Nasr, author ofTheDispensable Nation\"The best book I've ever read on political Islam and the Arab spring.\" --Peter Beinart, author ofThe Crisis of Zionism\"In this first draft of history, Shadi Hamid advances a bold, counterintuitive thesis about the Muslim Brotherhood's trajectory: that political repression before the Arab Spring forced moderation, and electoral victory in its aftermath brought on illiberalism and failure. Even those who disagree will have to take on Hamid's arguments about the centrality of ideology. Required reading for anyone who cares about the future of Islamism, liberal democracy, and the Arab world.\" --Noah Feldman, Bernis Professor of International Law, Harvard Law School\"Shadi Hamid has an almost oracular knowledge of the Middle East. His analysis of the rise and fall of the so-called 'Arab Spring,' which he distills in this excellent and eminently readable book, has been frighteningly accurate. This is mandatory reading for anyone interested in the past, present, and future of Islamism across the Middle East.\" --Reza Aslan, author ofZealotandNo god but God\"Foreign policy experts have long had a blind spot regarding political Islam, failing to understand or appreciate the complex interplay between a deeply rooted vision of a purer society and the competing demands of democratic legitimacy and constitutional liberalism.Temptations of Powerleaves us no excuse for continued ignorance.

Rostain and Regan give readers a solid primer, translating arcane principles of accounting. Then they add a human touch with telling details mined from a public record few others have explored.(David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer Prize-winning tax journalist and Syracuse University law and accounting lecturer)Few of us imagine that we will cross the line in our professional lives -- and be jailed, fined, or both. ButConfidence Gamestells a sobering tale of individual weakness and institutional and regulatory failure that allowed esteemed law firms, accounting firms, and multinationals to reap illegal profits at the expense of the nation.(Diane Ring, Professor of Law, Boston College Law School, and coauthor ofEthical Problems in Federal Taxation)This book manages what many might think impossible: it's a page-turner about tax. It shows what can happen when very smart people unconstrained by ethics invent and use ingenious schemes. The history is fascinating in its own right, but it is also, unfortunately, a much-needed reminder of how gameable regulation can be.(Claire Hill, Professor and James L. Krusemark Chair in Law, University of Minnesota Law School)Rostain and Regan have captured one of the most interesting -- and most troubling -- episodes in the checkered history of tax shelters. Their analysis raises critical ethical and policy questions about how we train, monitor, and discipline lawyers and other financial professionals today.(Anne L. Alstott, Jacquin D.
