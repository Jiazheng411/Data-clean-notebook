Still no sign of Buck and Ryan. She trusted her father to take care of her eight-year-old son, but that didn't stop her from worrying.On the plus side, he was a good rider, and his grandpa had taken him out on the trail many times. Just not overnight.And never had they been four hours overdue.Mallory paced the large ranch kitchen and stopped at the wall phone. Unable to stop herself, she picked up the receiver and called her dad's cell phone. It went right to voice mail…again. They must be in a dead area.She looked up when the housekeeper, Rosalie, walked into the kitchen. \"Still no sign of them?\"Mallory shook her head. \"I'm getting concerned.\"\"Do you think Buck is checking his watch? No. He has his grandson out there, teaching him the cowboy way of life.\"Over the years the housekeeper's once rich brown hair had turned salt and pepper. It was pulled back into a no-nonsense ponytail, revealing warm hazel eyes and defined cheekbones. Rosalie Dudley had been the only other female in the house since the death of Mallory's mother over fifteen years ago. Mallory loved her like a second mother.\"So you're saying I'm being overprotective.\"Rosalie smiled. \"No, I'm just saying Buck wouldn't let anything happen to the boy. You two are his life.\"Buck Kendrick owned a lot of land in this part of West Texas. On his forty-three sections he ran a large cattle operation, along with numerous oil wells, dotting the mostly barren landscape of mesquite, ocotillo cactus and buffalo grass that survived the area's lack of rainfall.Mallory knew her father would give it all up to have his wife by his side, and another half-dozen kids to inherit what he'd worked so hard to build. But she was his only child, and Ryan his only grandchild. And since her husband's death, there weren't going to be any more children. Sadness welled inside Mallory as she recalled her turbulent marriage to Alan. Toward the end she'd feared for her and her son's safety.Living outside of Lubbock, Texas, she'd been able to play the part of the dutiful wife. And keep Buck from knowing the truth about her husband's drinking and incomprehensible actions.She brushed aside the thought. \"You know, Dad isn't as young as he used to be.\"\"You better not let Buck hear you say that.\"Mallory smiled. \"Well, he still does too much. And I'm afraid he's going to show off for Ryan.\"\"Probably, but he's got Joe and Mick with him,\" Rosalie assured her. \"So let the ranch hands deal with Buck. And we better concentrate on the roundup. We'll have about three dozen hungry cowboys to feed this weekend, not to mention the other family members.\"\"That's why I'm here.\" Mallory let herself smile. This was the weekend she came home every year. Lazy K Ranch's late-spring roundup. With Mallory's busy horse broker's business in Levelland, they couldn't get back to Midland very often. Just about four times a year.\"Are you going to make fried chicken?\"Rosalie nodded. \"Your dad has already put in his order. He knows it's the only time I let him indulge in fried foods. How about you making that potato casserole?\"\"And some red beans and rice, of course.\" Mallory reached for a note pad when her attention was drawn to the kitchen window. Outside, a horse and rider were walking toward the barn. She looked closer. It was Joe. He was slumped over his mount.\"Rosalie, Joe's back, and something's wrong.\" She hurried out the door and kept the momentum going until she reached the horse just as two other hands arrived to help him down.\"Looks like he's been worked over,\" the ranch hand said.Mallory knelt down beside him on the ground. \"Oh, God, Joe, what happened? Where's Ryan and Buck?\"The foreman's face was etched with pain. \"Two men ambushed us right before dawn. They shot Buck and worked over Mick and me pretty good.\"She gasped. \"What about Ryan?\"\"That's why Buck sent me for help.\"Mallory's heart pounded harder as she looked around for any sign of another horse. \"Where's my son?\"\"I'm sorry, Mallory.\" He grimaced. \"I tried to stop them, but they took the boy with them.\"He had to be overlooking something.Chase Landon sat in his office at the Ranger Company in Midland, Texas. He'd gone over and over the same information for the past week. He'd prided himself on his ability to find clues that others had missed, but this old case still had him stumped.Since joining the Texas Rangers nearly nine years ago, one of his goals had been to find his uncle's killer. He also knew he should leave it to the Rangers'Unsolved Crimes Investigation Team in San Antonio. But this was too important to Chase, and he refused to give up.\"Anything new show up?\" fellow ranger Jesse Raines asked as he stuck his head though the doorway.\"No.\" Chase leaned back in his chair. \"Ballistics still doesn't match. There had to be another gun there. Another shooter.\"\"We could go back and take another look.\" Just being recently commissioned, Jesse was eager to help out on any and all cases. \"But after all this time, it's probably long gone.\"\"I don't think the shooter had enough time to get rid of it,\" Chase said more to himself than to his partner. He closed the manila folder and stood. \"Anything more on the Sweetwater escapees?\"Jesse cocked his thumb toward the door. \"The captain is talking with the state troopers now.\"Although he'd been in the Midland Company for only the past year, Chase knew this area well. He'd grown up in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas. His first job in law enforcement had been with the highway patrol there.Suddenly the captain, Bob Robertson, walked in. \"Landon. Raines. It looks like we've been called in,\" he told them. \"The two escapees, now identified as Charles Jacobs and Berto Reyes, have shot a civilian and carjacked a vehicle. Now, they've taken an eight-year-old boy hostage. So I need you and your gear ready in thirty minutes.\"The captain glanced at Chase. \"Sorry, Landon, looks like your vacation is temporarily on hold. I need you on this.\"\"Not a problem,\" he said. \"Where did they abduct the boy?\"\"It was on the Lazy K Ranch. Southeast of Interstate 20.\"Chase felt as if he'd been socked in the gut. Then dread washed over him. \"Buck Kendrick's place?\" He barely got the words out.The captain nodded. \"It's Kendrick's grandson, Ryan Hagan.\"Chase stopped breathing. Mallory had a son?\"You know the man?\"Chase managed a nod. \"A long time ago.\" He had trouble thinking of her with a child.\"So you know that even from Kendrick's hospital bed, he's demanding that every law officer in the state join in the search for his grandson. Not that I blame him.\" He sighed. \"We better get to it. The helicopter will take off in thirty minutes.\" The captain walked out with Jesse.Chase sank down into the chair and rubbed his hands over his face. This was crazy.Mallory Kendrick.The pretty, ebony-haired girl with big green eyes. An incredible contrast to her olive skin from her mother's Spanish roots. Tall and slender, she had legs that men fantasized about. But Chase had had to quit seeing her. She was too young, and way out of his league.She was the daughter of rich oilman and rancher, Buck Kendrick, and he was a kid from the poor side of town who would never fit into her lifestyle. But damn, even after all these years, thoughts still lingered of what might have been between them.Mallory Kendrick…Hagan had made him crazy for years. From the time she'd turned eighteen clear through to their heated summer romance and their breakup when he went off to join the rangers.Chase leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. If there had been a woman who could have deterred him from his dream…Mallory was the one.Funny thing was he'd returned to Midland to see if they could work things out between them, but he quickly learned he was too late. He'd remembered vividly how good old Buck persuaded him to back away when he'd showed up at the door and learned Mallory had gotten married to another man and was on her honeymoon.Over the several months that followed, he'd tried to convince himself it was all for the best. It didn't stop his misery. Even concentrating on his new career with the rangers, he managed to let Mallory interrupt his thoughts for a long time. She was the one reason he'd nearly refused the transfer here a year ago. He'd wondered if he might run into her. He hadn't so far.And now, he was going to drive up to her door.Her son was in danger. That had nothing to do with their past. It was the little boy he had to concentrate on…the boy he had to find. As a ranger, he couldn't walk away.Mallory stayed in the kitchen, and there was no point looking outside to see anything. It was after dark, and in the country that meant black as pitch. Besides, there were dozens of law officers who had cordoned off the area and set up a base at the barn. She could go down there. And do what? What she wanted was to grab one of Buck's guns, climb on a horse and go search for her child. They weren't about to let her do that. Look where that had gotten Joe and Buck.She had seen her father brought in hours ago. She didn't go with him in the ambulance, sending Rosalie instead. Luckily, his wound wasn't life threatening, and he only had to spend overnight in the hospital.Afraid and anxious, Mallory resumed her pacing while her mind worked overtime thinking about how scared Ryan had to be. And she knew that the convicts were lifers and had nothing to lose if they killed her son.No. No. A tear ran down her face as she began to tremble again. She had to get him back. Ryan was her life…. They'd gone through so much together.Her thoughts turned to the man from her past. Chase Landon. Nine years since Mallory had seen him. Back then he'd been a state trooper, with dreams of being a Texas Ranger. And when that day finally came, their idyllic summer had come to an end…and he had walked away from her, break...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She eventually grew up in middle-class comfort in England, missing the hardships, deprivation, and war in Eritrea. But she also grew up with the fantasy of many adopted children of someday being reclaimed by the birth family, as well as the guilt of being curious about her birth family and seeming ungrateful of the adopted family. In Pool’s case, there were the additional layers of differences in race and nationality. Still, when a biological brother contacted her, she wavered for 10 years before returning the contact. At nearly 30 years old, Pool returned to Eritrea to meet her family and reconnect with the culture of her birth. In this exhilarating and very personal account, she chronicles the emotional roller coaster of overcoming her insecurities and finding the courage to go and meet her extended family and try to blend together the very different parts of her life. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Enormously fat and relentlessly kind, Lara distracts the local bullies from all the negative attention that Laney has previously received. Unfortunately, Laras cheerfulness attracts quite a lot of nasty attention from her other classmates as well until something happens that tears down Laras remarkable spirit entirely. Laney is an engaging narrator. Particularly delightful is the way in which she tells the story. Each chapter has a title that is related to the narrative, such as Rising Action, Suspense, Dialogue, etc. Laney then explains why she chose to include or hold back pertinent information in accordance with her teachers storytelling rules. Her explanation of how to write a book is just as interesting as the events that shes describing. Best of all, none of this detracts from the novels emotional core. Thoroughly enjoyable and unexpectedly wry, this book is as intelligent as it is succinct.

Incidentally, tinnitus makes for a lousy souvenir.    The action takes place during the anti-war protests that transpired during the first Nixon administration.  It combines a whiff of tear gas, true love, and drug-fueled heart-breaking loss.  Incidentally, the author marched with the Veterans' Caucus of Oregon State University to protest the president's visit to Portland.  In the news photos, he's the guy trying to shield his mug.     Yeah, there were about nine of us there, leading a parade of a thousand or souls.  In the charter granted us by the university, our goal was to be the last generation of veterans.

Ross, an arts reporter for Toronto'sGlobe and Mailnewspaper, offers a unique historical survey based around a broadly interpreted theme: the power of reading. The chronologically arranged chapters touch on censorship, literacy, and the influence of political texts. Later chapters introduce Roman poet Lucan's works, which criticized the emperors' abuses of power; the development of the printing press and of Braille; defiant female authors in eleventh-century Japan; \"sanitized\" editions of Shakespeare; African American hero Frederick Douglass; and secret schools where girls were taught to read in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The focus is too wide; the narrative, anecdotal format may deter report writers; and the included source notes don't separate dramatized fiction from fact. Still, the accounts are fascinating, and Ross is an accomplished storyteller who brings history right into the present. Scattered black-and-white photos and art illustrate this timely, powerful text that teachers across the curriculum may want to share aloud, chapter by chapter.Gillian EngbergCopyright © American Library Association.

A hearing child of deaf parents, Allen enjoyed comfort and seclusion in his early family life, an experience that he tries to re-establish in the new family he is creating. His family's history is related somewhat self-consciously: \"These are stories my father never told me,\" begins the chapter on his Hungarian immigrant parents' experiences at a repressive school for the deaf. Tracking the development of Allen's family and the one he's trying to establish with Jeremy and the two boys, Jeffers draws parallels between deafness and homosexuality but fails to forge a convincing link. Despite his perceptive prose, Jeffers skirts his characters' hopes and the paradoxes of their lives rather than risking a fuller exploration of the tenuous safety that they find in love.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like fellow Brit Martin Amis, Self sees too clearly and then proceeds to revel in all that is horrible about modern life. Whether it’s the interminable monologues of the fusty anthropologist who spends years studying a tribe whose most discerning feature is that they are boring, in “Understanding the Ur-Bororo,” or the rise and precipitous fall of the drug-dealing brothers who operate in London’s West End in “The Rock of Crack as Big as the Ritz” and “The Nonce Prize,” Self never tires of serving up all that is most depressing about human nature, and he does so in language possessed of such ghastly clarity that there is no escape from his diabolical worldview.

Revenue management is timing price increases or discounts to boost profits. Airlines, for instance, often use special fares to fill otherwise vacant seats. The author founded a consulting business that maximizes the corporate income of his clients by using complex computer models to determine the best pricing systems. Cross, as reader, provides a clear presentation. He offers useful examples of how revenue management deals with supply and demand issues, although at times he seems to be using his platform to drum up business.

What is the best area to stay in? What clothes should we bring?\"And the list goes on!

They see the grow-at-any-cost mentality: corruption, factory sweatshops, pollution, lead-tainted toys, and massive infrastructure projects. But how do Chinese view themselves? Author Anand Giridharadas, who writes on global culture forThe New York Timesand theInternational Herald Tribune, ventures to four of the country's largest cities, spending time with people across a range of professions. He discovers that many Chinese feel that the country has grown too quickly--centuries of progress in decades--and lost its roots in a massive money chase. Part narrative, part reporting,Chinese Dreamsis contextually intelligent, exploring a country and people adrift between borrowed and inherited cultures. Voyeuristic and deeply nuanced, this well-written piece tells the stories of people trying both to hold on and to let go of their culture. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He briefly studied engineering, then law, and contributed to university magazines while a student. Despite life-long poor health, he was an enthusiastic traveller, writing about European travels in the late 1870s and marrying in America in 1879. He contributed to various periodicals, writing first essays and later fiction. His first novel was Treasure Island in 1883, intended for his stepson, who collaborated with Stevenson on two later novels. Some of Stevenson's subsequent novels are insubstantial popular romances, but others possess a deepening psychological intensity. He also wrote a handful of plays in collaboration with W.E. Henley. In 1888, he left England for his health, and never returned, eventually settling in Samoa after travelling in the Pacific islands. His time here was one of relatively good health and considerable writing, as well as of deepening concern for the Polynesian islanders under European exploitation, expressed in fictional and factual writing from his final years, some of which was so contrary to contemporary culture that a full text remained unavailable until well after Stevenson's death. R. L. Stevenson died of a brain haemorrhage in 1894.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book includes four, diverse case studies, showing readers how to apply the method to solve industrial-scale software design problems. These traits make this book unique within the field of software design and engineering.\"Kevin Mills, NIST\"This book presents a general, complete, and precise engineering solution, illustrated by many thorough examples, for model-based architecture and design. I strongly recommend it to anybody who wants to teach, or get acquainted with, the practice of modeling software.  Beyond notation, this book focuses on fundamental and practical modeling and architecting principles.\"Lionel Briand, Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo\"This is a 'must have' book for any senior technologist actively involved in the software development life cycle. It provides not only principles of software architecture, design and development but also practical examples of how to apply these techniques to produce high-quality, maintainable and extensible software. Dr. Gomaa, a recognized thought leader in software engineering, hits another home run with this volume.\"Mark Gianturco, Intelligent Discovery Solutions\"Software modeling and designing are complex activities. Developing high quality models, particularly by novice analysts, requires a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of modeling as well as its nuances. This book provides a comprehensive coverage of modeling the static and dynamic aspects of software systems and architectures. It presents a fresh perspective on software modeling and design through the application of the UML based COMET (Collaborative Object Modeling and Architectural Design Method) approach to real world examples. Dr Gomaa has done an excellent job of presenting the material in a simple and elegant manner. The fundamental concepts have been explained with lots of examples and further solidified through several case studies presented at the end of the book. Overall, this is an excellent book on software modeling and design that will be valuable for not only software engineering students but also practitioners.\"Vijayan Sugumaran, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan\"Software modeling continues to dominate as a method of choice for practitioners to gain an in-depth understanding of complex systems. Gomaa's book stands out from other titles on software modeling in both its breadth and depth of coverage. Its detailed case studies are second to none when it comes to really seeing how modeling can be applied in practice.\"Jon Whittle, Lancaster University\"The COMET method is a unique UML-based approach covering theories and practices for modeling and design of software systems. This book is the core of author's experiences and philosophy on software development.\"Michael Shin, Texas Tech University\"This is a large book with interesting, well-presented material; it is particularly strong in its wealth of examples, as well as its discussion of concurrency, which permeates the book. It is a strong contender for adoption as the textbook in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in object-oriented analysis and design, particularly when architectural design is the focus. Practitioners will also find it to be a useful tutorial and reference.\"Christopher Fox, Computing Reviews\"Software Modeling and Design is well written and concise, effectively describing a variety of software models and architectures. Gomaa has served in industry and academia; his research revolves around this book's topic, and he has made numerous contributions in the field. Possibly the best part of the book can be found toward the end, where the author presents a series of case studies.\"D.

When he was finally diagnosed, he was told that one of his testicles had to be removed. In this Kindle Single, he offers a detailed narration of his life and thoughts as cancer encroached, walking readers through the big moments: when he first noticed something was not right, doctor visits, the operation, radiation treatment, and beyond to the healthy, active life he currently leads. Sanford's writing is smooth as works to shine light on a misunderstood cancer.  He's also remarkably honest, often telling readers of highly personal and embarrassing moments. This personal essay offers a window into one man's life as it's briefly interrupted by cancer. While many still view it as a death sentence, Sanford considered his a springboard for a more fulfilling life. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 1088646, "title": "The Sum of My Parts (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "James Sanford", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 44.0}

In the discussions recounted here, John learns about three American Indian heroes (two real and one spiritual) and listens to a series of humorous folktales, related by Chasing Deer, about Iktomi, a Lakota mischief maker whose escapades illustrate what can go wrong when principles of cooperation are abandoned. Kaltreider’s portraits of Dakanahwideh, who founded the Iroquois Confederation, Sweet Medicine, and White Buffalo Calf Maiden, a holy woman who taught sacred traditions are engaging. And he manages to work a great deal of little-acknowledged conventional history into his conversations with Chasing Deer, who emerges as an inspiring ethical thinker.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book fits the bill by presenting a seldom-heard perspective, that of the African American community whose children too often find themselves on the wrong side of the gap. Hill, an urban school district administrator, argues that the concept of the achievement gap represents more than just a set of data; it is also a social construct that places poor and minority students at the bottom end of academic ability and potential. In framing her argument, she skewers both the conservative view that African American students do not achieve because they do not have either the capability or the drive to do what is necessary to succeed, and the liberal view that the students are merely the victims of uncontrollable outside forces. The author also identifies instructional models to support her contention that educators need to be focused on helping all students find their academic wings.Summing Up:Highly recommended. Graduate, research, and professional collections.(CHOICE)Dr. Hill has written an insightful book that offers an alternative view of the achievement gap; one voiced by members of the African American community, and one that must be taken into consideration as we attempt to find ways to promote more positive educational outcomes for African American students.

What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as \"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds,\" and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including \"embonpoint,\" \"quietus,\" and \"pluperfect.\" Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, forPeter Panhas a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are \"literary\" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as \"youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg,\" and the author interjects: \"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.\" A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Doka, PhDProfessor, The College of New RochelleSenior Consultant, The Hospice Foundation of AmericaHispanics, the fastest growing minority population in the United States, are increasingly willing to seek mental health counseling, creating a critical need for counselors to understand the values and traditions of Hispanic culture. This book examines these values and traditions and their impact on the ways in which this population copes with loss, grief, and bereavement across the life span.The book addresses the unique losses that may be faced by Hispanics, particularly newcomers who must adapt to a different language and unfamiliar customs. It focuses on such important cultural considerations as styles of verbal and nonverbal communication, personal space, social organization, environmental control factors, and the significance of gender. Competency-based models and Latino-specific counseling frameworks are integrated into the text, along with the historical and political context from which they arise. Numerous practical recommendations for improving quality of care are provided, with specific attention given to the great diversity of cultures within the Hispanic population, and the need for counselors to take these variations into consideration.Key Features:Facilitates understanding of Hispanic values and traditions to promote more sensitive and effective treatmentProvides exercises to help therapists evaluate their own knowledge and awareness of particular Hispanic culturesAddresses factors that may impede a successful therapeutic relationshipPresents specific techniques for building trust with Hispanic clientsIncludes illustrative case studies throughout the text\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is his earliest memory of a lasting fascination with the Church.  As the years went by, the author lost touch with the church of his youth, but his family’s drinking difficulties ultimately led him into a new career as an alcoholism family counselor. In time, he became director of therapy at an alcoholism treatment center in North Carolina. It was during this period that he began to hone his writing skills, producing many lectures and professional articles on alcoholism and drug addiction. As an alcoholism family counselor in the 80’s, he counseled a retired priest and a young associate priest who acted as family member. That telling encounter prompted a return to the church of his youth and eventually ignited a renewed, lasting interest in those extraordinary men and women who consistently dedicate their lives to a traditional faith, Church, and way of life. It became the key to his inspirational story of Father Sal and Sister Grace, who struggle with a burning love for their God, their Church, and each other.  Synergy is the author’s first major work of fiction. Donovan lives with his wife in North Carolina where he enjoys writing, gardening and volunteering in the parish community.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loves to write par-anormal romance (mostly because there is nothing paranormal about her life at all!) as well as horror and sci-fi.

Everspell makes her third book with Astraea and she has many more in the works. You can find her short stories, too, if you look real hard.  She is closer than ever to calling herself a full-time writer and the idea is both frightening and amazing.

Her life’s path veered abruptly, turning her home into a battleground and upsetting the orderly, predictable world she once knew. In presenting her story, Ritchie chooses to share fragments of her life both before and after that point, and she writes each vignette like a short story. She notes in the introduction that the experiences are true but that creating a fictionalized memoir allowed her to make some people and events into composites. In many ways, the approach also provides a sense of objectivity about difficult events and gives Ritchie greater freedom to contemplate the emotions and motivations of others....many times they are stand-alone stories that convey greater power as a single, focused event… For example, in “The Sand Quarter and the Starfish,” Ritchie details the budding relationship started at her factory job, but also weaves in other memories of that intense time, like taking her children to the beach. When one of her sons is anguished over the death of the starfish he took home as a prize, Ritchie’s character, Jean, tries to comfort him but feels parental guilt over her failure to explain that the starfish wouldn’t live out of the water. The parallel between the intertwined stories is subtle and heart wrenching… The staccato pace of the stories works well to create a portrait of Ritchie, and her graceful, wistful writing style pairs beautifully with the many complicated situations that have given her life meaning… Ritchie’s mosaic doesn’t always fit together neatly, and that’s her point. She delivers fragments that shimmer with honesty but remain as singular events that transformed her in distinctive ways.”  —ForeWord Clarion Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Gay & Lesbian", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Raised in Fairfax, California in a house built by his father Umberto. During World War II, Umberto worked as a cabinet maker in San Francisco during the day and simultaneously at MarinShip in Sausalito building Liberty Ships at night. During this time, Bob's mom Rose worked at Carson Glove in San Rafael making gloves for bomber crews. Bob had an older sister, Vera and an aunt, Saida who would take care of him at home. Bob attended Oak Manor grammar school, Central School and the San Rafael Military Academy. He played football and graduated from Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo in 1966. Bob enlisted in the United States Army in Sept. 1966. After training in Washington and Georgia, he was sent overseas to Germany in the Military Police Corps. At that time he was responsible for the processing of Soviet Military Liaison missions from Communist Eastern Europe into the Western section. In 1968, he was transferred to a NATO base in Livorno, Italy where he was assigned to a CID unit as a Military Police Investigator and interpreter as he spoke fluent Italian. He was also the base Traffic Accident Investigator. Upon his Honorable Discharge in Aug. of 1969, Bob returned to San Rafael. In Jan. 1970, he was hired by the Marin County Sheriff's Department as a Deputy Sheriff. He worked in the County Jail for a year, at which time he was transferred to the Patrol Division and stationed in Tiburon, California. He then was assigned to the West Marin area where three Deputies were responsible for a patrol area of over 425 sq. miles. During this time, he graduated from the Police Academy, Santa Rosa J.C. with a degree in Criminal Justice, obtained a California Dept. of Education Teachers Credential for vocational law enforcement courses at the college level. After a period of time, he went to work as a private investigator then put together an act as an Elvis Presley entertainer and performed in local venues; once performing on the Jerry Lewis Telethon.  Always looking for new ideas, one morning, he arose from bed and started writing about a cat which he actually owned. An orange tabby called \"Kitters\" which he had adopted from the Humane Society. According to him, the words/story just flowed and he could not write fast enough for his thoughts. A new career had just started for the Marin born native. Subsequent stories followed to be published at a later date.", "related": ["B005PFOIGW"], "rank": 1546070, "title": "The Kitten That Roared: A Kitten Called Kitters", "author": "Bob Guelfi", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.6429, "rating_total": 65.0}

Under Firth's guidance, Haring produced his first book on The Buccaneers in the West Indies in the XVII Century. This research laid the ground work for Haring's life long work on the history of the Spanish Empire and in Latin America. While at Oxford, Haring also studied briefly at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1909. David W.

The issue(s) it exhibits are historic yet current to touch and capture the post-independent ethnic conflict and cattle rustling. The question of small arms proliferation among Eastern Equatoria State ethnic communities, war culture and its aftermath in terms of social, economic and cultural family dislocation and trauma.... inter and intra ethnic conflict to promote proxy war that will finally weaken these ethnic communities and seeds among them sense of permanent hatred and continuous bloody conflict and social instability. The author made use of African traditional techniques of story telling: high quality of narrative styles. They combine third, first person point of view, dialogue and soliloquies. The nature is personified to evoke the resilient spirit of the African ancestors. The noble spirit of the forefathers and mothers play determinate role evoking moral and material extra-power to the heroine young mother and her royal son. Namala and her son is an epitome of the South Sudan man and woman on an ongoing process of social, economic and cultural transformation process. The spirit of resilience is well stated and is the leading theme in the many thematic issues that can be unmasked as one reads. Paul Atanya definitely deserves a credit for this excellent work.

For the Mole sisters, anything can become a fun adventure with a little imagination. InCool Breeze,the moles long for relief from the heat. Fortunately, a dandelion's leaf makes a fabulous fan: \"Swoosh swoosh.\" Soon, swooshing is everywhere, with comical and cooling results. InQuestionthe moles ponder the problem, \"Who are we?\" and set off to find out. Are they fish? they wonder. Fish live in water. Are they snails? \"Snails live alone. We could never do that.\" Finally they reach a satisfying conclusion: they're \"mole sisters, of course!\" Simple, succinct text incorporates child-friendly vocabulary and humor, and the whimsical colored-pencil art portrays the cute, expressive sisters engaged in activities children will recognize. The sisters' curiosity, playfulness, delight in little things--and in each other--continue to make these small, square books big in terms of charm and child appeal.Shelle RosenfeldCopyright © American Library Association.

I found the beginning somewhat slow but Joan's sudden appearance at an orphanage without a memory drew me in, I yearned to find out about her past. It's clear from the start that Joan was no normal teenager. Joan is gifted in her ability to have no fear of gangs or boys, a ruthless combination as an orphan against those who seek to oppress her, but to what end? What happened in her past that moved her to become so courageous? But then the toy telescope showed up in her life. That's when the story begins to take off. Joan Darcy begins to recall memories. She has been devoid of such things for a time, however these memories are very old and include intimate knowledge of places and war hundreds of years in the past. Her new friends, Miranda and Milton Caldwell, decide to take up the cause of helping her to regain information about her past. Strangely her past is connected to an organization that also offer philanthropy towards Autistic individuals. Questions build faster than answers. Cleary Joan is somehow connected to what the telescope shows, what is not clear is how. The story is suspenseful as the connection unfolds to the end.I found the story exciting and very fresh. It certainly doesn't have wizards, magic, or realms in middle Earth. The story relies on real cutting edge science which makes it so desirable to read as a science fiction fan. Things to watch for as a reader, never ask what Pisscannte means (Yes, this is the true spelling.) and don't miss the paper airplane trick, it gives new meaning to how dangerous paper can really be.

She loves challenging herself and would write on a dare. On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby.

It remained this way until it became painfully obvious that it was more lucrative working for other bands. Ken soon found himself in one bar or rock club every night, all the while keeping a full time day job.   Eventually , after many years Ken finally found himself on tour with KISS, Alice Cooper, Stone Temple Pilots, and many other bands, touring the world using the skills he had learned working the clubs night after night. After many years and even more miles, in 2001 Ken decided to leave the road and took employment in the entertainment field in Central Florida . Ever restless and seeking a challenge it wasn’t long before Ken started looking for new horizons, new worlds to conquer. The first project was a short film called “Santa 26:12, a short film that Ken wrote, directed and produced, shot in his living room after work with a budget of 3 pizzas. After that came film school, and working on as many film shoots as he could, even running for coffee if need be. All the while still working full time. It wasn’t long after that Ken started writing his first book, “We Are The Road Crew” which he self published.

After many late nights hanging in the salon listening to her clients complain about their relationships woes, Raina promised them that she would write a book for them that would give them a heads up on the games that are played in the dating world. Ridiculous Situations is the result!

Marianne, Charlotte’s younger and optimistic sister, decides to heal the breach between the families. But while searching for Nick aboard his ship, she falls into the hold and is not discovered for two days. Seeking revenge against Charlotte, Nick does not return to Poole. Instead he continues on to Boston, fully aware of the scandal that will ensue for Marianne, an unmarried lady in 1850 and unchaperoned on his ship for several weeks. Nick is a gentleman, however, until he begins to fall for Marianne. When she returns to Poole, Marianne is prepared for gossip, not the harsh words from her sister, who then throws her out of the house. Once again, Woods delivers a historical romance that leaves the reader wanting more; happily this page-turner hints that more is to come in a sequel. --Patty Engelmann", "related": ["B00AABP7JS"], "rank": 1876927, "title": "Salting the Wound", "author": "Janet Woods", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No matter where she is, there is always a book close at hand. Her love of reading began at an early age and blossomed over time to include many different genres, her favorite now being fantasy. As a preschool and elementary school teacher, Greta tried to instill the joy of reading in the children she worked with. Books were an important part of her classroom and story time was the highlight of the day. It has been a while since Greta was in a classroom but she had lots of experience in reading to children of various ages and remembers what they enjoyed listening to. She tries to incorporate that knowledge into her work as an author and believes it makes her a better writer of children's and young adult books. She now resides in SC with her husband, Robert and three dogs. Greta has five books published at the present time; three children’s books in the Patchwork Dog and Calico Cat series, one MG/YA fantasy entitled \"Gerald and the Wee People\", and a nonfiction account of her experiences with an autoimmune blood disorder called ITP - \"Heartaches and Miracles.\" One more book is in the works at the present time; \"House on Bo-Kay Lane\", the second book in the Wee People series.

You're awesome!\"5-Step Marketing Plan to Get More Customers, Referrals & Make More Money: A Winning Marketing Strategy for Small Businesses\" by Violet James debunks two myths about this pivotal business practice: marketing is mandatory, and every business owner can easily achieve results with a little know-how. According to James, marketing is the act of communicating the value of a product. This explanation logically leads the reader through five results-oriented steps. Knowing your competition, and finding a need and filling it are just the beginning. You will want to learn more as you read page after page of marketing-savvy tips. And if that isn't enough, her comprehensive resource guide reads like a Who's Who on the field.I expected this book to be much like any other marketing book lining the shelves of any bookseller in America. I was wrong. As I read it, I kept wondering about the author - predictably, she must be a seasoned pro. She spoke in simple terms but included the lingo of the marketing world. She gives the reader step-by-step instructions and assignments that could be completed the same day. However, she only gave one real-world example/illustration; I wanted more. James is a prolific writer, entrepreneur, marketing manager and web designer with over 20 years' business consulting experience. Other books include \"Simple Truths to Personal Success: You Can Have a Winning Attitude for Life.\" No doubt, we will be hearing more from James in the future.-Reviewed by Danita Dyess for Readers Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 1668627, "title": "5 Step Marketing Plan", "author": "Violet James", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, is never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From this love of history comes a love of paranormal history. Jeri has spent many hours studying firsthand what goes bump in the night, be it in the dark woods or run-down sanitariums and prisons. She believes that without historical context, the stories and legends of the haunted present wouldn’t be nearly as fascinating or spooky. Jeri is the creator and director of the paranormal group Cuyahoga Valley Paranormal. She uses this perspective when speaking on the radio and television and in print, like with WNIR, 19 Action News and Cleveland Scene magazine. For those who share her passion for historical hauntings and local history, she currently provides a variety of classes about both at the Quirk Cultural Center in Cuyahoga Falls, throughout the year and delivers information through lectures at public libraries and other local venues. Jeri also shares her experience by organizing community events such as haunted scavenger hunts and history hikes.

The story telling is excellent as befits two such strong characters. Boardman could be seen as the establishment Team GB figure reserved and scientific while Obree was a working class maverick riding home-made bikes using parts of his washing machine. To a degree you can paint their rivalry as that between science and art but ultimately both were united in their quest to go faster and their quick intuitive minds. To have two such world class time trial riders going head to head simultaneously was obviously a massive short term boon to British cycling but reading this book also left me with the feeling that the constant competition between the two lies at the heart of GBs cutting edge bike technology.\" -- Brendan Gallagher Sweetspot Cycling Book of the Year shortlist nomination \"A great read about a wonderful episode not just in British cycling but in world cycling too. Pickering brings a fresh perspective to the telling of the tale and strips away some of the myths that surround two riders who have become living legends.\" Podium Cafe \"The bare essentials is hardly how the modern sport of cycling is best described. With the genius behind the two-wheeled success of Team GB and Team Sky Dave Brailsford describing his philosophy as the 'aggregation of marginal gains', the attention paid to the smallest engineering, physiological and psychological detail is obvious. It is an evolution that is retold quite thrillingly in Edward Pickering's book The Race Against Time. This is the story of the 1990s rivalry of Chris Boardman vs Graeme Obree and their battle for the one hour track cycling record. Boardman remains well-known today thanks to his TV work as a pundit, Obree meanwhile has become a virtual recluse, a superbly gifted athlete who doubles up as an inventor. It's a great story, which in many ways created the base for the later success of Hoy, Pendleton, Wiggins, Cavendish, Froome and Trott.\" Philosophy Football, Mark Perryman's autumn sports books review", "related": [], "rank": 1672771, "title": "The Race Against Time eBook", "author": "Edward Pickering", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anyone interested in gaining insight about how the logic behind options pricing works needs to learn the visual quantitative finance skills in this book. This is the key to managing risk and to designing options strategies. The author has combined mathematical formulation with clarity of thought and expression.”--Michael C. Thomsett, author ofOptions Trading for the Conservative Investor, and co-founder of ThomsettOptions.com“Visual Quantitative Financedemystifies the complex mathematics of quantitative finance by moving from the abstract to the intuitive. Lovelady lays bare the mechanics of the Black-Scholes formula and then uses the framework to explain, both intuitively and visually, risk management and options-based structured securities. A crowning achievement in simplicity that will benefit investors and students alike!”--Don DePamphilis, Ph.D., Clinical Professor of Finance, Loyola Marymount University, and author ofMergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring Activities, 7th EditionModern Quantitative Finance Demystified!  A simpler, visual approach for every investor, financial professional, and student.Most investors today recognize the inadequacy of traditional strategies and instruments. However, they sensibly refuse to invest in securities they don’t understand. Unfortunately, alternative investments based on quantitative finance have been shrouded in confusion and advanced mathematics--placing them off limits to many investors who could profit from them. Now, Michael Lovelady cuts through the complexity, introducing a powerful visual approach to understanding options and related alternative investments.Blending practice and theory, Lovelady illuminates and simplifies the core principles of modern quantitative finance. Lovelady introduces an intuitive, visual framework for understanding option pricing: foundational knowledge for managing risk and designing alternative strategies. Then, building on this framework, Lovelady presents a complete option-based model for tailoring risk/reward profiles, adjusting market exposure, generating income, and building creative portfolio structures.Visual Quantitative Financewill be invaluable to retail and institutional investors contemplating alternative investments, to advisors who guide them, and to all students of finance.Coverage includes:• Random variables and option pricing• Option pricing methods• VaR and CVaR• Black-Scholes models• Investment profiles and model building• Stock-only and option-based profiles• Covered calls, condors, and SynAs• Understanding price changes• Greeks• Position management• Synthetic annuities, and moreMichael Lovelady makes quantitative finance more intuitive, visual, and accessible than ever before--giving investors the knowledge they need to confidently consider alternative strategies for controlling risk and increasing profit.Lovelady introduces powerful visual techniques for analyzing options pricing, profit probabilities, virtual dividends, market risk exposure, and more. After introducing his visual approach, he applies it to one of today’s most important investing trends: lower-volatility, higher-income strategies.Visual Quantitative Financewill be invaluable for everyone interested in quantitative finance, options, risk, structured securities, or financial model building--and for everyone who must explain these topics to nonspecialists.", "related": ["B007XGVPBM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A church member pulled up in the parking lot about that same time; he watched her well-meaning but under-achieving efforts, and he felt sorry for her. He had a nice long ladder in his big pickup, and he knew another member that had a power-sprayer, so he called him on his cell phone to ask him to come over and help out as well.

I expand the landing a little from the point of view of Mercy Smith, the introverted engineer.

Her losses only push her harder to preserve the friends and teammates she has left. Even before the crew determines that the artifact is a test, she sets the curve for caring and caution. Others have their own agenda for the alien technology, which is so advanced it feels like magic.The easiest part was capturing the wonder and finding tech to play with. I loved finding new ways for Lou, the pilot, to offend people in the politically correct climate.The hardest part of writing this story was watching a character I liked (in book two, Sirius Academy) twist to the dark side in response to bullying and mental imbalances induced by subspace. It gets dark, and he professes several things I don't believe in. To the people who are creeped out reading him: writing him was even worse. I knew I had the right tone when I had to shower after the first scene where he tells us how he really feels...it started with a joke I heard in high school and the subsequent bragging from the boy who told it.The mission is projected to last twenty years, and most of the eighteen astronauts have already paired with a partner of the opposite gender. Mercy is left with only two choices, neither ideal. I tried to make her choices (in part) mirror the ones facing the species. Both men have flaws and wounds. Both need mercy to heal and become the leader that the team needs.The fourth book, tentatively called \"Oblivion,\" is already planned.My wife hated that the plot in Antarctica succeeded.

I didn't even know that hard-boiled existed\nuntil a friend recommended The Killer and I stumbled across the genre.  I\n bought all three books, began reading and have had very little sleep\nsince.  I simply couldn't put them down.  What a page turner.  I\nintended to write individual reviews for each book (I still might) but,\nhaving just completed the whole trilogy, then I have to commend Mr.\nElgos for the way he has played games with my head.  I don't like the\nIRA.  I don't like terrorism.  So why have I been rooting for an Irish\nassassin turned MI6 operative?  Because I couldn't help myself, that's\nwhy. Yet now I am questioning my whole set of beliefs.  I'm sure that\nJack Elgos did not set out to be political here.  This is a story of\nrevenge set against a political background, that's all, yet the author's\n avoidance of any deep, moral point only serves to make that point more\nstrongly. Conflicts, troubles, war all lead to a futile loss of life.\nWithout giving anything away, the ending is absolutely brilliant.  This\nhas something for everyone.  It's action packed, seriously fast paced\nand a thriller for sure.  It even has a bit of the mystery, whodunit\nabout it. I highly recommend reading this trilogy, but make sure you\ndon't have anything pressing that you need to do in the meantime.Third Time Lucky ByIris Gioia", "related": ["B00J1QC2KK"], "rank": 1165198, "title": "The Killer Book III: The Final Reckoning (Start of Action 3)", "author": "Jack Elgos", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the product of an ongoing effort to know our place in the universe and share with readers the underpinnings of the magnificent cosmos where we are given a chance to exist only very briefly. The essays incorporate a group of challenging ideas that modern physics and cosmology are struggling to understand, in a unique way that incorporates mythological, religious, and philosophical perspectives. The author relies on a simple and powerful philosophy that we are part of the universe and the universe is part of us. This wonderful collection of essays provides a journey through the current frontiers of modern astrophysics and cosmology. Its depiction of the most important unsolved mysteries about our place in the Universe is peppered with original insights and philosophical perspectives, making it an intellectual treat.– Avi Loeb, Professor, Harvard University Chair, Astronomy Department; Director, Institute for Theory and Computation In these essays, Santhosh Mathew combines an impressive knowledge of physics with an eye to its connection to Eastern philosophy as well as its relevance to our life in modern times. In his thoughtful investigation of natural phenomena and their relationship to universal philosophical truths, he takes up where The Tao of Physics leaves off. You may well find his keen curiosity about the natural world and our place in it infectious.– Carole Bugge (C. E. Lawrence), author ofStrings In this informative assemblage of engaging essays Santhosh Mathew takes the reader on a deeply human quest for truth, a truly inspiring journey that boldly addresses the big questions of what the Universe is, how it came into being, and where it may be heading. This exciting adventure is as much a rich scientific history of elegant physics, mathematics, and cosmology as it is a philosophical and spiritual pursuit fueled by human imagination. In this age of globalization Mathew recognizes that we need a new and a more whole story, a new epistemology that links our current and cutting edge intellectual scientific understanding of the physical Universe with our deeply spiritual, mystical, and philosophical insights, and he skillfully weaves the foundation for such a story, leaving the reader with a sense of awe, wonder, power, humility, and belonging.– David Morimoto, Division Director, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Lesley University", "related": [], "rank": 2181050, "title": "Essays on the Frontiers of Modern Astrophysics and Cosmology (Springer Praxis Books)", "author": "Santhosh Mathew", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A truly powerful and inspiring story. Susan Sarandon It's a risky business putting yourself between whale and harpoon but someone's got to do it! Gripping, real life adventure from a crewmember who served in the Whales' Navy. Reading of the cold, the ice, the enemy, and the whales who got away, you are there with the Sea Shepherd crew. Ingrid Newkirk, Co-founder and President of PETA The vast majority of people in the world make up the force that is driving species extinct not by the day but by the hour. Yet in spite of terrible odds and difficult conditions there is a small and dedicated number of people who are working selflessly to stem the rising tide of extinction. Laurens de Groot is one of them. Read his book and you will learn what it takes to lend a hand to reverse the extinction crisis, Mother of All Crises and you will be inspired to activism. Douglas Tompkins, conservationist and founder of outdoor brand The North Face An insightful and heartbreaking account of the daring crusades against illegal whalers. Shocking and utterly gripping, this books shows how one person can make a difference, and just how important that difference can be. Isabel Lucas, Actress and Environmental Activist The vast majority of people on this planet, whether they realize it or not, are living by killing. That's the primal image of life, with humankind and its casual killing - of each other, the environment, animals, insects, etc. And yet, there are also people on this planet who have evolved beyond this primal image of life, wherein living by killing has been transformed into living by loving. Such is the author of the book that you now hold in your hands. Shaun Monson, writer/director of Earthlings, winner Best Documentary Film at San Diego Film Festival You can't help but admire the sheer determination, unremitting spirit and extraordinary courage of de Groot and his fellow activists. A terrific and eye-opening book about life on the frontline and the people who risk everything in their desperate bid to stop the atrocities of commercial whaling. Mark Carwardine, zoologist, conservationist, presenter, photographer and writer Laurens is the living embodiment of my favorite strategy: Do unto others as they do unto others. The days of allowing whalers to destroy the greatest creatures - and cousin mammals no less! - just to show how big and tough they are should have been ended by governments. But because they didn't act, it's important to know what inspired Laurens to take his pursuit of justice from Holland to the oceans. This is his story. I hope it becomes as well known as Ulysses. Please read this book, and get others to do so ASAP! Alex Lightman, futurist and winner of the first Economist Reader's Award for 'the innovation most likely to radically impact the world over the next decade' A powerful reminder of this ongoing battle against brutality and greed. The Lady an action-packed account...there's no denying the tension in descriptions of sabotage attacks on the whalers, nor de Groot's commitment to the cause.

For Bill Jeter, all it took was a counselor’s probing inquiry about a scene in his childhood. She asked him to work through grief by writing about a painful childhood experience—his little sister’s death after falling off of her bicycle. The counselor had no idea that opening the wound would facilitate Bill’s discovery of a world of joyful memories underneath the sadness. As soon as his very sharp #2 pencil hit the paper, exciting recollections of his Huck Finn childhood seemed to call out from the depths for expression.Bill went from writing about his little sister to composing hilarious mosaics drawn from childhood adventures that he and his friends engaged in to amuse themselves during those innocent years when he thought kids weren’t supposed to die.Surprised by the powerful, life-giving force of writing about people and places that impacted his growing up years, Bill enthusiastically shared his stories with these long-time friends. Their positive feedback encouraged him to share his artfully crafted stories with a wider audience, which led to greater demand for his book.Bill’s passion for adventure and for the great out-of-doors, as evidenced in the ten vignettes in BOYHOOD ALONG THE BROOK CALLED HORN, did not stop in childhood. Over the years he pursued backpacking, canoeing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, skydiving, flying lessons, and art lessons. Ever eager to answer the call to a challenge, at the age of 50, Bill started serious mountain climbing. All of this was in addition to his years as a successful businessman (including 27 years as a self-employed State Farm agent), a Sunday School teacher, and a Boy Scout leader. A dedicated family man, now a widower after 34 years of marriage, Bill enjoys the freedom of retirement which allows him to spend more time with his son, daughter, grandson, and his sister… and his new passion, writing.", "related": [], "rank": 2962188, "title": "Boyhood Along the Brook Called Horn eBook", "author": "William F.

Claire firmly believes that stories we share with others are a way for people to connect, whatever the story may be. This is where her love of writing and storytelling began. An avid reader since her youth, she became a story teller through her retelling of stories, redeveloping them, and then creating her own through various life experiences. Her favorite stories are the ones that have left deep impressions on her heart, enlightened her mind, and strengthened her spirit. From these beloved stories that touched her, she began writing for writing’s sake. As she wrote, more elaborate stories developed, and then plots for her books were born. As a wife, a mother of two special needs boys, and a lifelong educator and pupil of life, and now a writer, Claire’s life never has a dull moment. She is a university administrator by day, and by night she lets the hopeless romantic in her aid in her story telling, writing, and dream weaving. When there is a free moment, she spends this time in ministries through Church communities in Southern California. Whether it be through music and song, sharing stories with others, or spending time with the brokenhearted, such ministries have been fulfilling to her and providing much material for her ongoing storytelling. Claire hopes that the stories she shares through her writing will inspire and encourage readers to seek and live a life of purpose, and to find their own meaning. Each story Claire writes is a glimpse into her faith, her hopes and dreams, and her love for her family and friends. She loves to meet new people and making new friends. Claire is looking forward to meeting her readers and sharing more stories.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I look forward to a long run on this freshly graded track. The hero of my novel, Andy Pettigrew, decides to leave a prosperous career on Madison Avenue to be a singer-songwriter. He dreams of an inner peace that money cannot buy. And when he says he's \"dying to actively pursue his bliss\" he's not kidding. Like Andy, I'll joyfully create books, songs and poems whether or not anyone notices. The creative process itself provides its own rewards. For me, finishing a novel is an exciting accomplishment. It's something to be savored. It makes me feel really good inside, and the relatively simple act of putting \"Dreams Worth Dying For\" in the Kindle Bookstore makes me smile. Seeing my book's cover in print (albeit electronic for now) reminds me of how I felt when I saw my first byline atop a newspaper story.
