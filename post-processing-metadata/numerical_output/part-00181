For instance, on day three (integrity), readers are asked to notice contradictions in their behavior and reduce hypocrisy. Strategies for achieving results are given every step of the way; readers are encouraged to keep a journal of daily progress.

Entries include  pronunciation, definition, and often a sample sentence to  illustrate use. However, only about a quarter of the words have  sample sentences, and many of the less familiar words were not  among them. In addition, many of the samples are quite generic,  and some include a citation noting the source, which seems  unnecessary since this is not an academic book. This work may be  of interest to the \"browser\" of the title and of limited  assistance to someone seeking a simple etymology, but the  serious scholar or lover of the language will find it  lightweight.

Current applications are as diverse as high-throughput screening for drug candidates to 3-D prototyping for nanoscale fabrication. Microdrop generation is also critical to many major industries ranging from the food, cosmetics and vaccine producers to the manufacturers of integrated circuits and displays. What continues to be exciting is that there are still undiscovered ways to create and use microdrops, many of which have huge commercial implications that have yet to be tapped.Microdrop Generation by Eric R. Lee does more than justice to this complex and fascinating subject. It is essentially a practical book that provides students, scientists, and engineers with all the relevant theory - from particle physics to fluid dynamics - while never losing sight of how the theory works in reality. It covers the practicalities of how microdrops can be ejected, how drives and nozzles can be engineered, as well information on key imaging techniques and hints on troubleshooting.This book is the result of nearly ten years of experiment and wide consultation by an expert in the field, and apart from being the definitive work in the area, is not only highly informative, but also highly readable.

All of these discussions are productive; some of them are dazzling...These narrative turns create the dual impression that, first, there is virtually no corner of American politics, society, or culture where the discerning eye will fail to discover evidence of \"race\" and its workings; and, second, anywhere Lipsitz casts his gaze he will find something interesting and insightful to say.

And while things do in fact change over time, the basic underlying idea of seasons and seasonality is that even though things do change, they often return to a particular state over and over again—often in a very predictable way.Over the course of the past twenty-five years, author Jay Kaeppel—one of the most experienced profes-sionals in the areas of seasonality and stock, options, and futures trading—has examined a wide range of seasonal and cyclical trends as they relate to the stock market over the past century. Now, with Seasonal Stock Market Trends, he shares his extensive insights with you.Written in a straightforward and accessible style, this book will show you how following the calendar—and taking advantage of consistently strong seasonal trends—can help you to achieve long-term stock market success. Kaeppel introduces you to a wide array of seasonal stock market trends—most based on 70 to 100 plus years of actual market data—and identifies objective \"rules\" for utilizing each one. Along the way, he also presents a process that allows you to track the performance of a given strategy, so that you can gauge its overall effectiveness.Just a few of the trends touched upon include:Holiday Seasonal Trends, which looks at the trading days surrounding market holidays to reveal some surprising resultsMonthly Seasonal Trends, which focuses on a variety of intramonth market trends and breaks the month  down  into clearly defined favorable and unfavorable trading daysRepetitive Time Cycles of Note deals with the performance of the stock market in relation to three specific, and repetitive, time cycles—the 212-week cycle, the 40-week cycle, and the 53-day cycleSell in May and Go Away thoroughly analyzes the  advantages and disadvantages of breaking the year into two six-month periods for investment purposesRounding out this detailed discussion is a chapter devoted to using a variety of seasonal trends to build three separate investment models—the Long-Only Method, the Long-Only Plus Leverage (LOPL) Method; and \"Jay's Ultimate Seasonal Barometer\" (or JUSB). These detailed models are designed to generate specific buy and sell signals, and require no interpretation on your part.Seasonal Stock Market Trends will help you incorporate seasonal trends into your current investment or trading endeavors and put you in a far better position to generate consistent profits over time. Free of complicated trading systems and so-called surefire secrets, this book will set you on a solid path to finding opportunities in the markets based on recurring seasonal patterns.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With Dewey solidly ahead and third-party candidate Strom Thurmond expected to siphon off much of the traditionally Democratic southern vote, Truman’s prospects look dim. Snap Malek, a Truman backer, covers the police beat for Dewey’s most ardent media supporter, the Chicago Tribune. On a slow news day, Malek receives an anonymous call from a man representing the New Reich, an anti-Semitic group with plans to assassinate Truman on an upcoming Chicago campaign stop (Truman was the first world leader to officially recognize Israel). Malek immediately takes the information to his connection with the Chicago police. The plan is to keep the threat under wraps, but that gets tough when the group begins killing random citizens and demands that the Tribune give it a forum. The fourth Malek mystery builds on its base of detailed historical context and on Goldsborough’s 21 years of experience at the Tribune. Clever plotting and a well-developed protagonist close the deal. A solid historical series that deserves a wider audience. --Wes Lukowsky", "related": [], "rank": 1240943, "title": "A President In Peril (A Snap Malek Mystery Book 4)", "author": "Robert Goldsborough", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I first moved to Oregon I had trouble finding an apartment I could afford that would allow me to have my dogs (at that time, two Jack Russell terriers.)  SO... despite it being winter/early spring, I lived in a tent in various locations between the Deschutes National Forest outside Bend (where a friend lived, making it handy to grab a shower before work) and Eugene (where a sister lived). Every location in the story; the weather, the bright nights with or without a moon, the tree Povre hugs, the U of O, even the house on \"Agate Street\" (which is a real street but the real house is actually a few blocks over and where my sister used to live) is a location I experienced.I was writing stories about the blue-furry Sirgel race since 1974 or so, so for the readers who think current blockbuster movies and suchlike were the inspiration, let the record show that I didn't get the idea from James Cameron or even from Star Trek the Original Series. If anything can be blamed, it was probaby \"Super Friends\" since my original Sirgel characters were twins pretty much like the Wonder Twins in appearance, except blue and slightly furry. (Just in appearance, they didn't have superpowers, heheheh.)  Hopefully, one day, I will dust off the adventures of who are now Povre's great-great-great something kids and make them suitable for public consumption.I hope you enjoy this story!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.1875, "rating_total": 67.0}

Priestley, the son of a schoolmaster, was born in Bradford in 1894. After leaving Belle Vue High School, he spent some time as a junior clerk in a wool office. (A lively account of his life at this period may be found in his volume of reminiscences, Margin Released.) He joined the army in 1914, and in 1919, on receiving an ox-officers' grant, went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1922, after refusing several academic posts, and having already published one book and contributed critical articles and essays to various reviews, he went to London. There he soon made a reputation as an essayist and critic. he began writing novels, and with his third and fourth novels, The Good Companions and Angel Pavement, he scored a great success and established an international reputation. This was enlarged by the plays he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s, some of these, notably Dangerous Corner, Time and the Conways and An Inspector Calls, having been translated and produced all over the world. During the Second World War he was exceedingly popular as a broadcaster. Since the war his most important novels have been Bright Day, Festival at Farbridge, Lost Empires and The Image Men, and his more ambitious literary and social criticism can be found in Literature and Western Man, Man and Time and Journey Down a Rainbow, which he wrote with his wife, Jacquetta Hawkes, a distinguished archaeologist and a well-established writer herself. It was in this last book that Priestley coined the term 'Admass', now in common use. Among his latest books are Victoria's Heydey (1972), Over the Long High Wall (1972), The English (1973), Outcries and Asides, a collection of essays (1974), A Visit to New Zealand (1974), The Carfitt Crisis (1975), Particular Pleasures (1975), Found, Lost, Found, or the English Way of Life (1976), The Happy Dream (1976), English Humour (1976) and an autobiography, Instead of the Trees (1977). In 1977 J. B. Priestley received the Order of merit.

A must-read for those who lead! (Lawrence Kemper, coauthor, The Politically Intelligent Leader)Strong Schools, Strong Leadersis filled with so many ideas that will advance collaboration in our schools today. Not only does Wiseman offer readers the all-so-important foundations to school leadership, but he also provides specific activities to bring each of them into fruition. This is really what has to happen before a true professional learning community can! (Stephanie Cereceres, retired middle school principal, San Bernardino City Unified School District, CA)Finally, here is a book that understands the complexities of educational leadership today. In a step-by-step process, Wiseman outlines a realistic, plain-speaking approach to not only leading, but inspiring collaborative change in our schools. As a university president with a school of education, I only wish that we had had this book available for our educational leadership students. (Sharon S. Caballero  President, New Mexico Highlands Uni, president, New Mexico Highlands University)Educators thinking about starting professional learning communities or other collaborative groups will findStrong Schools, Strong Leadersa must-read. As someone with years of experience building teams and people, I found the tenets of the four key foundations contained in this book compelling. Those key foundations—listening to people, building agreements, cocreating purpose, and fostering effective teams—are the hallmark of today's successful leader. (Bonita Drolet, coauthor, Building Teams, Building People)What Perry Wiseman manages to achieve is a useful synthesis of multiple ideas and strategies, presented in a compact, readable form. He imparts his ideas clearly and backs them up with ample examples, which ably move the reader from theory into practice. This book contains information that would be of interest to any school administrator, regardless of length of tenure in that capacity. It would be especially valuable to a novice school leader or anyone needing an easily comprehensible roadmap for guiding and molding a fragmented school into a functional, unified community.

He served in the Royal Engineers (popularly known as ‘sappers’) from 1907-19, being awarded the Military Cross during World War 1.  McNeile started writing in France, adopting the pen name because serving officers were not allowed to write under their own names. When his first stories, about life in the trenches, were published in 1915 they were an enormous success. But it was his first thriller, ‘Bulldog Drummond’ (1920) that launched him as one of the most popular novelists of his generation. It had several amazingly successful sequels, including ‘The Black Gang’, ‘The Third Round’ and ‘The Final Count’.  Another great success was ‘Jim Maitland’, featuring a footloose English sahib in foreign lands.  Sapper published nearly thirty books in total, and a vast public mourned his death in 1937, at the early age of forty-eight. There are several feature films of his work.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": 1848037, "title": "Knock Out (Bulldog Drummond Book 8)", "author": "Sapper", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the only child to live to adulthood, his father, Captain William G. Fitch, a graduate of West Point and a Union officer in the Civil War, encouraged him to become an architect or to engage in a career of business, but his mother, Alice Clark, in whose eyes he could do no wrong, always believed in his talent. She would hire the architectural firm of Hunt & Hunt to design the sarcophagus set inside an open Tuscan temple for his final resting place at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York. Fitch graduated from Amherst College in 1886, where he was a member of Chi Psi Fraternity. He was the first American playwright to publish his plays. His first work of note was Beau Brummell (1890), a major work set in the English Regency which became a showcase for actor Richard Mansfield (1857–1907), who would play the title role for the rest of his life. His 1892 play Masked Ball (an adaption from Alexandre Bisson's Le Veglione) would be the first time that Charles Frohman put Maude Adams opposite John Drew Jr. which led to many future successes. In 1900, Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, made a star of Ethel Barrymore. He is remembered particularly for his works such as Nathan Hale (1898), The Climbers (1901), The Girl with the Green Eyes (which ran 108 performances at the Savoy Theatre in 1902, and starred Robert Drouet as John Austin), The Woman In the Case, (which also starred Drouet and ran 89 performances at the Herald Square Theatre in 1905),The Truth (1907) and The City (1909). His works were popular on both sides of the Atlantic. His play based on the heroine of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem Barbara Frietchie met with mixed reviews in 1899 because of the romance he added to the tale, but it would be successfully revived a number of times. In 1896 he wrote the lyrics to a popular song Love Makes The World Go 'Round, with the arrangement by William Furst.", "related": ["B007ENRKBS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Another murder in Boston before the opening sends ticket sales over the top and Wetzon over the edge. Her love life founders and collapses, her business ventures suffer and she is unable to save Smith from a shocking discovery. Then Dilla's lover Susan dies with a crucial secret, leaving Wetzon and Carlos facing a final curtain and keeping readers guessing up to opening night. Meyers was assistant to producer Hal Prince for many years; theater buffs will have fun trying to identify the real-life characters behind her fictional ones.

Not all lead to the results as in the case of the USS Frank E. Evans in 1969.

This is not turning a corner in your corvette, a lot of room is required and above that, good solid communication and attention by all responsible for keeping their collective eyes on what is going on.The story would be of great interest to sailors and history buffs. It would help greatly those who have not or do not travel on the seas. It awakens you to the dangers that exist at every minute on board a ship. An error such as what happened in this event takes numerous lives, the ocean is unforgiving.The nature of the story may turn off the casual reader who is used to Hollywood's action packed thrillers, but do not put the book down.  This book will result in your learning something new and you will come away from it with a new pride in those that serve in the U.S. Navy.This is a story of tragedy and survival, as the efforts of many resulted in the saving of numerous lives that would have been lost if not for the combined efforts of all. -- Military Writers Society of America", "related": ["B008E6SOF0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An author of books and screenplays, as well as a musician and songwriter, Dayne thrives on the creative process. The hardest part has been finding a balance between the creativity and the day job. Dayne loves books, music, travel, her family, things with motors, cowboy boots, football and cooking. Her parents have been her biggest supporters, as well as her biggest fans.  Dayne is single and lives in northern Oklahoma, but she was born in Texas and considers both states home.  Along the way to publishing her first novel, Dayne has worked as a librarian, secretary, accountant, retail salesperson, cashier, and a host of other odd occupations. But the creativity is what drives Dayne, and it's the creativity that makes every other crazy thing in life worthwhile. Dayne finds creativity, not only in writing, but in music, cooking, sewing, quilting, and cross stitch.  She has a passion for automobiles and movies.  Dayne is active in the music field, working as a songwriter, publisher and recording artist. She likes music  that is real. She believes that music which comes from deep inside the artist, is music that will deeply touch the listener.  A woman of wide interests and even wider dreams, Dayne has a quest for knowledge that cannot be quenched. She has a strong quality of empathy, which is reflected in her books and in her work.", "related": ["B007MGCPW6"], "rank": 1149639, "title": "Marriage 101", "author": "Dayne Gearner", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When they visit an old hotel in Mineral Springs, Texas, they meet a gorgeous, naked hunk named Patrick, who needs a bit of help passing through the light. While exploring the hotel, they discover a body in the elevator shaft. The local sheriff considers them suspects, so Alice and her motley crew--a rottweiler, a Siamese cat, and her ex-husband, Detective Jack Robecheau, in addition to Aunt Twila and Granny Chisholm--set out to find the true culprits and satisfy their dead clients. This fast-moving story gets still more complicated when a band of guerrilla survivalists joins the cast. Alice and friends must solve the crimes before a bomb destroys them along with the hotel.

McBride, well known in the movie industry for such works as Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success (S. & S., 1993) and Orson Welles (LJ 6/15/96), details Spielberg's life from his childhood in Cincinnati, examining the artistry as well as the man. McBride includes numerous interviews and minute detail of the artistic development of Spielberg, promoting the image of the director as a serious artist who has been possessed by the idea of filmmaking since childhood. The accounts of filming Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with their never-before-attempted special effects, provide fascinating insider information. The sound quality here is excellent. This work will appeal to serious moviegoers who want to know every detail of Spielberg's life and career.?Nancy R.

She believes that learning and experiencing life is an art form, a gateway to transcend and express abstract dreams into concrete realities, having an opportunity to leave a unique impression on others, changing their lives by seeking answers to the same questions she has had in life--to question things for herself, to find alternative answers, to go back to nature, and encourages her readers to do the same in their lives.Carrie is a bestselling author of several books, including \"The Essay Tutor\", \"Bodymorphosis: A Mind and Body Curriculum\", \"Patience through Perspective\", \"Simplify and Beautify Your Life with Natural Coconut Oil\", and \"The Home Spa Book.\"In addition to writing, Carrie has served as an instructor and tutor of English and writing at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": ["B00A6A2M9Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As both a magazine and art collector's buying guide, Eyes in spotlights fields of art, books, design, architecture, film, fashion, music, photography, culture, real estate, culinary arts, and travel. Eyes in delves into the respective insights, disciplines, pieces, and peoples of each field in easy-access formats, such as digital issues and mobile publishing solutions. Aiming to provide both accessibility and exclusivity to creators, collectors, gallery owners, art institutions, film production companies, and education facilities, Eyes in offers readers the latest trend updates and innovations in each field. Future expansion of Eyes in includes the exploration of multitudes of artistic arenas appropriate for both children and adults. Additionally, in the near future, technological advancements will allow Eyes in to provide you with information about anything and everything interesting in fields of art, travel and culture at the click of a mouse, touch of a stylus, or swipe of a finger. For now, Eyes in is committed to an offline and online magazine. Any product or service that can be developed or implemented to allow us to more closely monitor those innovations in the art, culture and travel scenes for our audience will be of our interest. Eyes in Magazine is published by Eyes in America Corp. in New York and is owned by editor Vivian van Dijk, an inspirational and mulch-faceted individual. With design and fashion education from the London College of Fashion and Saint Martin's College for Art and Design in London, van Dijk has a plethora of fashion and design knowledge. Taking her knowledge of design and fashion to the masses, van Dijk became an interior decorator and designer. Before that point, van Dijk earned a Master's Degree in Psychology and a Bachelor's in Business Administration. Now combining all of her experience, education, and love for the arts, van Dijk aims to produce a solid, sophisticated magazine that touches the aesthetics of the arts and the hearts of numerous art lovers. More personally, as a child growing up in an artistic family in the business of arts, Vivian learned from a young age to appreciate how creative disciplines can benefit the innumerable people involved in the arts. Even as a child, witnessing the arts, artists, brands, companies and institutions educating one another to create and enjoy more future arts innovations, Vivian realized that both national and international movements in the arts influence more arts movements. Now, as an adult acknowledging this fluidity and influence of arts movements, Vivian sees a need for Eyes in to follow movements and update the readers, artists and companies. Because art is timeless and inspiration border-less, aspiration will always follow.", "related": ["B008E88ZDY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 40.0}

Wiggins believed that life on Earth was much more ancient than was generally assumed-predating the known paleologic eras by millions of years. For 35 years, he explored the remote corners of the world, seeking the relics of these ancient creatures. Now, in his recently discovered journals, the world's greatest paleozoologist describes his arduous travels and astounding discoveries. Accompanied by his pet Gibear, an odd, furry little creature with seemingly mystical powers, the doctor treks from continent to continent in his quest for prehistoric remains. He finds them everywhere-from the Amazonian Umbrella Fish to the Brittle Bones of Cornwall. Written in chatty diary style, the journals often draw moral parallels between contemporary society and the fossil record. For example, Wiggins records that the Two-Headed Mammoth Bison of ancient Nebraska had both herbivore and carnivore heads and ultimately devoured themselves, demonstrating that people are often their own worst enemies. The journals are a fascinating mixture of whimsy and reality. While the prehistoric creatures are wildly fantastic, the settings-from Yellowstone to Antarctica-are real places. References to historical figures and events are sprinkled throughout. Authentically rendered antique maps, sepia-toned pages, and annotated \"hand-sketched\" illustrations, complete with mock-Latin classification names, enhance the impression of a rediscovered antique travel record. An amusing science fantasy with some subtle but incisive commentary on modern civilization.-Elaine E. Knight, Lincoln Elementary Schools, ILα(c) Copyright 2011.

The loyalists, she argues, saw an ‘unnatural rebellion’ when revolutionaries found ‘a glorious cause.’ In a close examination of loyalists in New York City, she shows that the differences between the two groups were sharp even though they shared many of the same values.Chopra’s book is not an apology for the loyalists.

Jill's frenetic sleuthing is further muddled by her personal angst with boyfriend Howard, until a flabby sting operation finally nabs the killer.

Now, the McKenna Chronicles are ready to be read by the public.  As Peaster states:  \"It's only right.  Writing about the McKennas during naptime all these years has made it possible for me to raise all these kids.\" Peaster and her husband still homestead on their land, raising vegetables and chickens and selling eggs to their neighbors while caring for the children who are still at home.

In this third Bernard-Snooky mystery, the unlikely sleuthing partners are visiting wintry Vermont, where the relatives of Snooky's current sweetheart begin dropping like flies.

Never was a son more indentured to his mother's  love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel, D.H. Lawrence's  young protagonist. Never, that is, except perhaps Lawrence himself. In his 1913 novel he grappled with the discordant loves that haunted him  all his life--for his spiritual childhood sweetheart, here called Miriam,  and for his mother, whom he transformed into Mrs. Morel. It is, by  Lawrence's own account, a book aimed at depicting this woman's grasp: \"as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers--first the eldest, then the second. These sons areurgedinto life by their reciprocal love of their mother--urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't  love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives.\"Of course, Mrs. Morel takes neither of her two elder sons (the first of  whom dies early, which further intensifies her grip on  Paul) as a literal lover, but nonetheless her psychological snare is  immense. She loathes Paul's Miriam from the start, understanding that  the  girl's deep love of her son will oust her: \"She's not like an ordinary  woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb  him.\" Meanwhile, Paul plays his part with equal fervor,  incapable of committing himself in either direction: \"Why did his  mother  sit at home and suffer?... And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so  cruel  towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother  suffering, then he hated her--and he easily hated her.\"  Soon  thereafter he even confesses to his mother: \"I reallydon'tlove her. I  talk to her, but I want to come home to you.\"The result of all this is that Paul throws Miriam over for a married  suffragette, Clara Dawes, who fulfills the sexual component of his  ascent to manhood but leaves him, as ever, without a complete  relationship to challenge his love for his mother. As Paul voyages from  the working-class mining world to the  spheres of commerce and art (he has fair success as a painter), he  accepts that his own achievements must be equally his  mother's. \"There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich  with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled... All his work was  hers.\"The cycles of Paul's relationships with these three women are  terrifying at times, and Lawrence does nothing to dim their intensity.  Nor does he shirk in his vivid, sensuous descriptions of the landscape  that offers up its blossoms and beasts and \"shimmeriness\" to Paul's  sensitive spirit.Sons and Loverslays fully bare the souls of  men and  earth. Few books tell such whole, complicated truths about the  permutations of love as resolutely without resolution. It's nothing  short  of searing to be brushed by humanity in this manner.--Melanie  Rehak", "related": ["B00H2JY71K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 29.0}

The protagonist of this dark novel is a 23-year-old American named Joe who, inspired by a photograph of a slain World War II Russian patriot named Zoya, travels to Moscow in the waning days of Communist power. Once there, he soon meets another Zoya--this one a very much alive woman \"with a broad, smooth, blond face, made taut, it seemed, by her high cheekbones\". Whereas the Zoya that brought Joe to Russia in the first place was a martyr for her country, her namesake is doing everything she can to get out--including recruiting women for a sex-slave ring run by the degenerate Gerald. It isn't long before Joe is drawn into an unholy alliance with both. This is a dark novel and one that can, at times, become somewhat overwrought--Joe, for example, \"stopped having religion when [he] stopped being able to f---.\" Nevertheless, Plante touches on themes that preoccupied the great Russian novelists before him: faith, free will, the riddle of God and the existence of evil.

A well-written and engaging effort to sketch out an intelligent 'anthropology of Islam' by presenting what particular Muslims 'do' and how those Muslims understand what they do.' William A. Graham, Murray A.

W and Lars are back in England.

He suggests to Lars, a fictionalized version of the author, that they embark on one final lecture tour, traveling the country and speaking about the impending death of philosophy as a subject of study and as an intellectual pursuit. Like the previous two novels, this one is definitely not for all tastes. It’s deliberately disjointed, bouncing from subject to subject, often without any warning or transition, the story shaped by W and Lars’ seemingly directionless dialogue (but, if you pay close attention, a direction does emerge). Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle: you can get a sense of where it’s going at various points, but you can only see the big picture when you’ve finished it. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mulaney started life in the middle of the depression in Mena Arkansas, clinging to principles and values that gave family importance and kept the country together. He served in the Army during the Korean Conflict from 1952 until 1957. Home again, he attended college in Overland Park, Kansas, finishing up in Lamar, Colorado, where he and his wife, Esther, settled, while they raised two daughters.  He was quite the cowboy in those early days, working farms and ranches in the southeastern Colorado area. Sometime near 1959, he arrived at the Bus Depot in Lamar, where his wife and some friends were gathered for coffee in the evening. Dressed in chaps and side arms, with his hat low and his spurs jingling, he startled the many customers, who weren't used to cowboys showing up in downtown.  He spent the next several years working as a lineman for the electric company, then rescuing people in the 1965 Flood along the Arkansas River. After that he hung up his lineman belt and began working for a local appliance company. Eventually, the entrepreneurial spirit grabbed him and he opened his own appliance company until he retired in 1993. Always an adventurer, his retirement came after he fell out of a tree he was trimming.  After years of storytelling, he decided to try his hand at writing. A collection of ideas became a plot and Out of the Forest was the working title for this adventure. He continues to write while working in the Hospitality Industry, enjoying the opportunity to meet a wide variety of people and pursuing his interest in photography.

This 22-year-old single mother of one is the hottest new writers to enter the literary game (urban fiction genre) in a long time. She has a writing style all her own. Though it maybe true, ''There's nothing new under the sun,'' nobody can quite write a story like Keisha Ervin. She is destined to take the literary world by storm and breathe new life into the urban fiction market. Growing up, she received numerous accolades and awards for her writing skills. Keisha has been honing her skills and practicing her art since childhood. However, by the time she reached her turbulent adolescent years, fate interceded, altering her childhood dreams. At the ripe old age of 18-years-old, Ms. Ervin became a casualty of teen pregnancy. Her literary career would be a dream deferred. Refusing to become a victim of circumstance, Ms. Ervin was forced to buckle down and re-analyze the direction in which her life was going. Accepting motherhood as a blessing in disguise instead of a curse, she was forced to mature. Realizing she had another life depending upon her for survival, she cleaned up her act, severing her street ties and making the successful transition to motherhood and author.  Hailing from the Midwest, St. Louis, MO to be exact, Keisha Ervin is determined to bring more long deserved recognition to her birthplace just as rappers Nelly, The St. Lunatics and Chingy have done. With her debut novel Me and My Boyfriend, Ms Ervin takes you on a journey to her hood where we meet Meesa and Black.

For those working with psychodynamic treatment, his case vignettes and his deep appreciation of the natural goodness in human beings is an added bonus!(Peggy Hutson, MD, Florida Psychoanalytic Society)Contrary to what its title suggests, this is not a self-help book but a relatively dense psychoanalytic exploration of its subject matter. Akhtar (psychiatry, Jefferson Medical College) draws primarily on classic psychoanalysts (e.g., Karl Abraham and Melanie Klein), more recent contributors to the field (e.g., Donald Winnicott), his own clinical experience, and other sources, while also making references to popular culture and thinkers outside the psychoanalytic movement. Although the writing is quite technical, the book is well written and will appeal to anyone interested in the topics addressed. For example, the discussion of courage in patients and psychotherapists is compelling. This book exemplifies the strength and limitations of relatively orthodox psychoanalytic theorizing and practice: provocative and experientially grounded insights are intermixed with assertions based on assumptions accepted within the psychoanalytic community but less than self-evident to psychotherapists with other orientations. Summing Up: Recommended.(CHOICE)By elucidating the origins, dynamics, social pleasures, and clinical benefits of courage, resilience, gratitude, generosity, forgiveness, and sacrifice,Good Stuffsheds light on a corner of human experience that has remained inadequately understood by psychoanalysts and other mental health professionals.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are 28 different\nWellness Enablers that help with your physical fitness, psychological\nhealth, emotional fulfillment and spiritual satisfaction. At the end of\nthe text, there are weekly and monthly scorecards for marking down each\nday's Wellness Enabler with room for comments. There is also an\nadditional 28 days of Wellness Enabler included which could easily allow\n you to extend your Wellness Program further.I smiled as I read this book. I had expected this would be exactly like\nthe usual wellness prescriptions but that was not at all the case with\n\"Improve Your Wellness Quotient\". The Wellness Enablers are fun and, for\n the most part, easily accomplished. Narayani's presentation of each\nenabler is inspirational and open-ended. There is never the sense that\nthe author is telling you to do something a certain way; instead, there\nis more of a gentle nudge showing you how you can expand or improve your\n life, health and wellness. While some suggestions may be more appealing\n than others (I, for one, shudder at the thought of de-cluttering),\nthere are so many simple and practical things to promote wellness, such\nas an hour spent in a park, coffee with a friend or playing with your\npet. Who knew wellness could be so much fun?", "related": [], "rank": 4864629, "title": "Improve Your Wellness Quotient in 28 Days", "author": "Lakshmi Narayani", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She's addicted to House Hunter's International and has never missed an episode, though she acknowledges that she could never live in most of those countries because the houses are just too small. She is also addicted to Starbucks' Chai Latte, and never passes up an opportunity to have one. Sandy grew up on the Texas Gulf Coast with sand between her toes and perpetually frizzy hair. Which is why she now lives in the middle-of-nowhere Virginia, in a place with minimal to moderate humidity (for perfect, non-frizzy curls,) rolling hills and farmed forests. The only downside to that is the temperamental satellite internet and the closest Starbucks being a thirty minute drive away. Home is a renovated old farm house she shares with her hero husband, in the foothills of Blue Ridge Mountains, where she's owned by more cats, dogs and horses than she cares to admit to. She's a long-time member of RWA, and is a member of VRW and the Beau Monde. Second to writing is her love for her horses. She practices natural horsemanship, and loves to ride her barefoot Tennessee Walkers on the trails and in the woods around her home.

Indeed, she had never been interested. Until now.This has to stop, she thought fiercely. Yet even as she considered this, she was helpless to do so. The heat was becoming almost unbearable now, the fluttering in her heart, wild with excitement and aye, she will admit it to herself, fear -- a fear that her control of the situation was slipping away fast.It was madness, she knew. She had tight control of her actions. In fact she had spent a lifetime successfully controlling every aspect of her life. Yet this man, with only one melting look, could strip away her barrier, her one protection, and leave her feeling stripped naked, vulnerable, and wanting something that only he could deliver.Derrik's hand slipped around her nape, gently cupping the back of her head. His other hand trailed down and lightly clasped her jaw. He then tilted her head ever so slightly to the side.\"What are you doing?\" she asked, watching him breathlessly, the blood humming through her veins.Her gaze settled on his mouth as she became mesmerized by his lips which were inching, closer and closer.With his lips just above hers, his eyes locked onto her brown ones, and he murmured, \"You entice me too much, my lady.\"And she was very enticing. He had kissed a number of women; he had even stolen a kiss from the object of his affection when he was young, but he had never felt this all consuming desire to savor the sweetness from one woman's lips. His brain told him to stop. He knew that one kiss wouldn't satisfy the raw hunger that ignited the moment he saw Amelie standing at the foot of the castle steps. But even as his mind told him this, his body continued to act on its own accord.His eyes followed his long fingers as they traced her jaw line, caressing her smooth, silky skin. They trailed along her throat, feeling the fluttering pulse there. His mouth stretched into a smile to discover that she was not wholly unaffected by his touch. Her breathing was erratic, coming out in short, rapid spurts, as if she was underwater, struggling for air.But the smile that touched upon his lips faded as his own breath quickened. And as his lips hovered over hers, as their breaths intermingled, the roar of his racing heart drowned out all other sounds.His eyes fastened to her mouth once again and all his thoughts, all his desires zeroed in on her plump, luscious lips.Like a loaded cart set in motion along a hill, there was no way to turn back; he could only move forward, could only go where temptation beckoned.And when their lips finally touched, the electricity as powerful as a lighting bolt ripped through his body, awakening, charging it, causing that part of him, which had been asleep, to become fully aroused, fully alert...--Books by the author:First Kisses - A Medieval Romance Edition (FREE)The Knights of Honor Trilogy:One True Knight - Book 1A Knight's Duty - Book 2Fallen Knight - Book 3  -Available now!The PromiseHeart of a Knight", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": 369471, "title": "A Knight's Duty (The Knights of Honor Trilogy Book 2)", "author": "Dana D'Angelo", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A 'hunter' from early childhood, which was spent on the Cornish moors where anything that wriggled, walked or ran was of interest, Penny has a keen interest in hunting dogs of all types, though the canines which sparked her interest in hunting with lurchers were the Irish Wolfhounds she kept in her youth, one of which managed to catch rabbits on a regular basis. Though preferring to be labelled a hunter for the pot, targeting edible game, Penny uses her dogs for pest control as well, and though lurchers will always be her foremost love, her terriers play an important part in many of the tales in this book.  However, getting inside the minds of her domestic predators is what Penny finds the most fascinating, together with the almost symbiotic relationship the hunter has with his or her hounds.

Innovation and the interface of art and technology, along with sociology and politics, are his subjects. . . . He writes of 'better appreciat[ing] the sophistication, idiosyncrasy, and value of these oddball contemporary American efforts to find viable poetic strategies for dissent, critique, and utopian dreaming.' Despite what some readers regard as the willy-nilly hodge-podge that is today's poetry, this is a book not of dreaming but of focused attention on what is new.\"—Choice(1 February 2014)\"Nobody's Businesswill provoke real interest as it follows avant-garde poetry into its most recent manifestations. Brian M. Reed has the information on the latest debates concerning Flarf, conceptual poetics, and the unfolding interfaces between poetry and digital techniques.\"—Bob Perelman, University of Pennsylvania, author ofThe Marginalization of Poetry: Language Writing and Literary History\"The title ofNobody's Businessrefers to the nose-thumbing qualities of all avant-garde practices and situates these gestures in a context of global economic crisis. Brian M. Reed addresses a range of important new developments that have emerged after language writing, notably the advent of conceptualism, digital poetry, and Flarf. Reed knows the poetics of these movements extremely well, and his prose is a delight to read.\"—Michael Davidson, UC San Diego, author ofOn the Outskirts of Form: Practicing Cultural Poetics\"Do we have avant-garde poetry, now, in our century? How can we read it? Can we simply read it, or do we need to listen to it, or to see it? How does it differ from the groundbreaking, frame-breaking art and poetry of the past? Can it alter its readers' all too rational, productivity-driven, Internet-enabled, sped-up lives, or does it simply reflect those lives? And can it do anything else? Brian M. Reed's critical writings make him an ideal guide and answerer for all these questions, and (even better) a perfect, and perfectly clear, explainer for the challenging poetry—or post-poetry, or even anti-poetry—that he recommends. Far from content to dissect a zeitgeist (though he does that, too) or to respond to existing tastes, Reed goes on to advocate the challenge in the performed and printed poetry of a transatlantic, transmedia generation, connecting Gertrude Stein to Donna Summer, remix culture to radical political critique, in such not-quite-yet-famous poets and performers as Danny Snelson and Rachel Zolf (he's also got much to say about those often-studied, semi-quasi-antithesis, Conceptual Poetics and Flarf). Reed's critical prose is pellucid, his arguments memorable, and his volume an introduction for writers and creators who could surely use one. This is a book that will stand up with time.\"—Stephen Burt, Harvard University, author ofClose Calls with Nonsense: Reading New Poetry", "related": [], "rank": 3075541, "title": "Nobody's Business", "author": "Brian M.

Opal returns to Woodcock Pocket to visit Toot and Puddle and brings along a much-admired companion. The self-deprecating Opal claims that Daphne is good at everything–much better than she could ever be. Wise Puddle assures her that \"everyone is different and everyone is good at different things.\" Daphne is quite pleasant while proving that she can hold her breath longer, turn a cartwheel more flawlessly, and play the violin better than the others. She enjoys competition as long as she comes out on top, but when she doesn't, her little snout gets out of joint. She's petulant when Opal wins at cards, refuses to try new foods, and won't help out with the raking. However, when Daphne can't deal with a spider in the bathroom, it's little Opal who comes to the rescue. Daphne finally swallows her pride and openly admires Opal's bravery. Hobbie's signature watercolors are delightfully warm and appealing; October leaves on a sunny day almost warrant sunglasses, the glows from fireplace and lamps exude coziness, and the foursome's breath-holding contest is priceless. A gentle, entertaining lesson showing that everyone is special.–Maryann H. Owen, Racine Public Library, WICopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I've tried my hand at painting (which ended when my \"moon\" was fondly compared to a 2-year-olds version of the Death Star) and woodworking (at which point I realized I should not be allowed around power tools), before  finally settling on writing.  Over the past decade my writing has gained a certain level of complexity and maturity, which is a direct result of my own maturing while serving in the United States Army.  I'm now an Army Major with multiple combat and humanitarian deployments.  I've found a balance in my writing between the realism of war (as seen in the Brink of Distinction series), difficulties of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (as seen in Rage), and the complexities of maintaining relationships (which is prevalent in all my writing).

I'm very passionate about writing. Ever since I can remember, I've always been deeply in love with creating new worlds to escape into. I've never bought into putting what I do in one genre or making stereotypical characters. Recently I was asked what genre my books were in and to tell someone what my characters were like. That's a hard thing to answer because when I write a story, I never care about what genre it may fall into or what people may think a certain character should be like. I care about telling stories and creating characters that are as complex as people are in real life. I love to tell stories that involve all of the joy and pain that we all go through in life. Sure, I write fiction, so a lot of it is unbelievable, but that's not the point. I want my characters to have a life outside of whatever they do for a living, and I want their love life to be as big of a part of their story as it is for us. I also want them to doubt what they're doing at times. I've never liked characters that were completely stoic all the time. I like characters who can love, fear, and overcome all in the same storyline.  When I'm not writing books, you can find me doing all sorts of things. I love music and movies, and I take any chance I can get to travel and expand my own little world.", "related": ["B00EJ2A9GK"], "rank": 1719227, "title": "Strange Visions: The Calm", "author": "Mitchel Grace", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I feel that we have much in common in our unconventional management styles, which have helped us overcome adversity and have fun along the way.

Now I see how the story ends it should be compulsory reading and a real inspiration for all budding entrepreneurs.' -- Sir Richard Branson '[Walker's] drive, tenacity and knowledge of his business remained with him throughout his turbulent period away from Iceland, and I was not remotely surprised by his great comeback.

Well done, Malcolm.' Sir Philip Green 'Having competed with Iceland, and therefore Malcolm, throughout my retail career, the insight this book provides into what makes him tick would have been invaluable to me, had it been published 20 years ago!

Robert, as you met him in The Illicit Love of a Courtesan, is an arrogant rake, with a chip on his shoulder. This is the Robert you will meet again. A rake in the full sense, who has lived his life hard and fast. I have studied the real rakes of the Regency period, those who courted the courtesans I studied for the first book in the Marlow Intrigues series, including Lord Byron and his set. Robert is a reflection of the things I have learned in letters and memoirs of the era, and he reflects the behaviour of these men who believed in Romance, for show, but not in fact.", "related": ["B00KGGPK1W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 66.0}

I\nhave had many people say that it was difficult to find a light romance\nstory without erotica. In the year 1600, Felicity is seeking independence\nin a highly restricted society.She decided to adapt her alternate person, Ian Rutledge\nto help her find out what men really think and do in the forbidden\nnight life of London.Felicity cannot accept that in these modern times in 1600\nLondon, she cannot have more freedom in a male driven society. After Jack\nhas betrayed her, she decides to put away the tears of a girl and become\na woman. She will find a way to put the power of her destiny into her hands.\nNot being bound by the gentry of the British as she is Swiss, she has\ndecided to play a man's game, in every way. Will Shakespeare's play has\njust opened and there the events begin that will change everything. Review posted by ifandorbutpublishing.com", "related": ["B00BTNA1QU"], "rank": 1434088, "title": "Felicity's Beaus: How Could She Choose Just One?", "author": "Madison Kent", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.4444, "rating_total": 40.0}
