What I found particularly attractive about this book are the historical notes, the references to many mathematicians and their work, as well as many original proofs included. In closing: I think that any student and any teacher interested in a deeper study of elementary (and maybe not so elementry) study of such topics as sets, polynomials, and numbers should read (pencil in hand!) this book. It may be particulary valuable for future teachers. The book is very well written, and it has detailed proofs and many exercises. Above all, this book will be remembered for its beauty and elegance.\" (M. Poplicher, Read This! The MAA Online book review column (for complete review seehttp://www.maa.org/review/shafarevichdiscourses.html\"... As the book progresses it becomes increasingly clear that the author has planned the development of ideas meticulously, not only so that he can constantly surprise the reader with the next turn of events, but also so that he can demonstrate unexpected links between results in algebra, number theory and probability. There are numerous ideas here for providing stimulating lessons for able pupils as well as for self-study, and the book would make a valuable addition to the school or department library.\" (G. Leversha, The Mathematical Gazette, 88:511, 2004)\"Since it happens so rarely, one must take notice when a great master of mathematics writes an elementary text. ... Shafarevich takes the subject much farther than any high school text. ... This book could form the basis for a great \"transition to abstraction\" course and should certainly have a role in programs training high school mathematics teachers.Summing up:Recommended. General readers; lower- and upper-division undergraduates; professionals.\" (D.V. Feldman, Choice, June 2003)\"... While written for students at the secondary level, the text goes quite thoroughly into foundational matters normally encountered at university ... This book is highly recommended for teenagers with a strong desire to study mathematics and for secondary teachers seeking to contextualize what is on the school syllabus and to appreciate what some of their students will meeet in university mathematics.\" (Edward J. Barbeau, Zentralblatt für Mathematik 1004.00001)\"Discourses on Algebra is an advanced elementary algebra book intended to supplement the content of algebra courses … .

Above all, this book will be remembered for its beauty and elegance.\"(Mihaela Poplicher, MAA Online, September, 2004)\"In this introduction to algebra, the author aims to show that the subject is no less beautiful, elegant and logically coherent than Euclidean geometry. … it should appeal to able students and undergraduates who are looking for a more sustained and challenging course in elementary algebra. … There are numerous ideas here for providing stimulating lessons for able pupils as well as for self-study, and the book would make a valuable addition to the school or department library.\"(Gerry Leversha, The Mathematical Gazette, 88:511), 2004)\"In this book, the author – a famous Russian algebraist – argues with examples that algebra is no less beautiful, elegant, and logically cohesive than geometry.

Wilson Lander, whose tragic childhood (both his parents died before he was 10) left him with a permanent sense of dread, meets Susan \"Cricket\" Page, a sexy woman working in an occult store only until she ships out to sea as a crew member on a private yacht. Feeling trapped and unhappy, Lander, an executive assistant to his girlfriend, Andrea, a v-p at a small brokerage firm in an unnamed coastal city, is vulnerable to Cricket's seductive allure. Around the same time, in a farfetched plot element so smoothly integrated into the story it feels completely natural, Lander falls in with some young African men, survivors of the tribal warfare ravaging their home, the fictional country of Bupanda. Lander ends up going to sea with the mysterious and untrustworthy Cricket. But loving Cricket means entering a world of modern-day pirates armed with both guns and laptops, who live on an island off the coast of barbaric Bupanda, where slavery thrives. Reunited with his Bupandan friends, Lander is forced to choose between Cricket and his own humanity. After a near mythic journey of over two years, Lander comes back to civilization and settles down-but Cricket has a surprise in store for him yet. Intensely atmospheric, occasionally cynical yet somehow timeless in its sensual tone, the book is a clever and intriguing balancing act, a fantasy with enough real-world roots to make it all seem as horribly plausible as it is wonderfully entertaining.

Before that he skimmed through high school with ease and even a bit of boredom that kept him in hot water most of the time.  After high school, he attended business college long enough to realize that he was no good with numbers and would never be an accountant or a programmer.  Off to see the world in the U.S. Navy during the closing years of the Vietnam Conflict, he saw the greater part of Dixieland by moving from Texas to Florida to Tennessee to Georgia to Florida... a great disappointment.  Using the educational benefits offered by the U.S. military, he began his college career in Florida and finished it off in Texas after returning home in the earlier 80's with a bachelor's degree in secondary education. One tumultuous year trying to hammer scientific facts into the unwilling heads of thirteen/fourteen year old students, he turned to public service, working for the State of Texas where he is still employed full time, but his real love, his real vocation is and always has been writing. During a particularly trying time in his life, he was isolated in small motel room for four months due to a change in job status.  It was then that the first book in his Red Cross of Gold series was first written.  Over the past fourteen years, the series has blossomed into an adventure saga of epic proportions.  He continues to write, edit and enjoy his secondary occupation, hoping to write full time now that he is retired.", "related": ["B00APKQH7K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jay Macklin, who six months earlier lost his office manager job, has persuaded his paramedic wife, Shelby Hunter, to spend a few days at a friend's remote Northern California cottage, in a last-ditch effort to save their 12-year-old marriage. At night, in a winter downpour, they have trouble finding the cottage. On a search for matches after a power failure, the couple drive to a neighbor's house, where they encounter Brian and Claire Lomax, whose marriage is obviously in more trouble than their own. Jay and Shelby soon realize Brian physically abuses Claire. When the Coastline Killer, a vigilante who's been targeting random victims because they don't respect the environment, claims another victim, the local police consider Jay a suspect. The denouement will leave many readers feeling cheated. (Nov.) (c)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In her most recent novel, \"Murder in the Stacks,\" Clay spins her tale in New Smyrna Beach. Florida, where a controversy continues with history and archaeology experts over the timing of colonial establishments in St. Augustine and New Smyrna in the 1700s. A much anticipated debate on the subject at the New Smyrna library one night turns into an argument, then a melee. The meeting AND the library are evacuated and shut down.   Word soon gets out that two people are found dead in the library. That's when Clay's characters--primary are friends and former college chums Penny Sue, Ruthie and Leigh, who are now of a \"certain age\"--get to work: first, to determine the causes of death; then to unravel a complex set of seemingly unrelated facts that involve everything from past romances to home security systems, the New Jersey mafia, a women's investment club, book returns at the library and good old-fashioned detective work.   \"Murder in the Stacks\" is a fun summer read and will provide a good mental workout in crime solving.

The collection touches on Wilson's longstanding interests: the importance of character in thinking about crime and education, the centrality of religion in national life, and the role of heredity in shaping behavior (in one recent essay he argues that our genes are a major factor in determining our political attitudes.) Wilson is at his best when he argues from close readings of historical evidence and social science data, which often yield trenchant insights—on the growth and solidification of federal programs, the unimportance of school spending and class size to educational outcomes compared with intangibles like academic expectations and discipline. But sometimes, as in his grousing about Obamacare and his dismissal of European-style social democracy on no firmer grounds than its alleged incompatibility with American exceptionalism, he simply repeats conservative preconceptions. Always good at provoking intellectual brawls, Wilson doesn't always succeed at settling them.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Based on a real-life serial-murder case in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the novel is a surefire winner, with a gripping story, well-drawn characters, and an unusual setting. Peffer is a very talented writer, and readers advisors should recommend him aggressively to mystery readers of all stripes, particularly those who enjoyed the late William Tapply’s Brady Coyne series. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His mother is adamant that he not ride, so the 16-year-old must practice in secret at a friend's family arena. When a rogue bull, Rhino, nearly finishes him off, Jana's grandfather agrees to train Layne. A convenient wedding gets his mom out of the way so that the teen can ride in the local rodeo, predictably, on Rhino. He survives, his mom loves him anyway, and he gets a nice kiss from Jana. Halvorson portrays her protagonist as an everyteen hero with fair success: he gets angry, gets hurt, takes responsibility for his actions, and shows brotherly affection for his younger sister on several occasions. The author also highlights the often-overlooked sport of rodeo riding without dramatizing the very real dangers or flooding readers with unwanted details.Linda Bindner, Truman State University, Kirksville, MOCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 852430, "title": "Bull Rider (Orca Soundings) eBook", "author": "Marilyn Halvorson", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also worked as an examiner for the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) grading both English 1 (English Composition) and English 11 (Literature) papers. During the years of teaching in Guyana, my creative outlet was the short story or play. I gave these to friends who taught at other schools and who used them either for their own entertainment or for end-of-semester elebrations. Very little of these early creative explorations have survived. Despite those early explorations and my conviction that teaching was going to be my life-long vocation, I have shared with my students that I did not always envision teaching composition as my area of specialization, and that I only began teaching composition because I hated the way people of my generation were taught math. I have confessed to students that since English was my second best subject, I majored in English by default.

They are so immediate in their concerns for the parish, so focused on God's Word and Sacraments that they draw us to wonder at the devotion of this man of God. Yet these same prayers and addresses sound most beautiful on the lips of laypeople, for whom Walther first spoke and wrote them. What more-fitting anniversary tribute could we bring to the One who raised up Walther than to turn our eyes heavenward, join our hearts in prayer, and raise up to God's throne these sincere petitions, which still define our highest spiritual needs as His children? --Rev.

Each volume is broken down into regions of the world and includes clear discussions of jewelry, textile production, hair care, grooming, hygiene, and a warrior's battle dress. The garments of both men and women and different classes are addressed, as is the impact of climate, geography, charismatic leaders, and significant historical events on costume. Details such as the development of clothing and accessories in the ancient world are particularly interesting, as the use of tools and materials became increasingly more sophisticated. Colorful reproductions, drawings (some labeled), photographs of artifacts, and informative sidebars are used effectively to emphasize points and help create visual images. The arrangement of the volumes works best for students studying a certain period; it may prove cumbersome for those researching one place over a longer period of time. A Fashionable History of… series (Heinemann Library) offers similar information but within a shorter time frame and with a focus on Western dress. Librarians looking to beef up their collections in this area will find these titles to be useful and engaging.Jody Kopple, Shady Hill School, Cambridge, MACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was born at Geneva, of a family which had already made its mark in the literary and scientific world: his great-aunt, Marie Huber, was known as a voluminous writer on religious and theological subjects, and as the translator and epitomizer of The Spectator (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753); and his father Jean Huber (1721–1786), who had served for many years as a soldier, was a prominent member of the coterie at Ferney, distinguishing himself by his Observations sur le vol des oiseaux (Geneva, 1784). François Huber was only fifteen years old when he began to suffer from a disease which gradually resulted in total blindness; but, with the aid of his wife, Marie Aimée Lullin, and of his servant, François Burnens, he was able to carry out investigations that laid the foundations of a scientific knowledge of the life history of the honey bee. His Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles was published at Geneva in 1792 (Eng. trans., 1806). A second volume of work published along with the first came out in 1814 which covered many more subjects including the construction of comb and experiments on the respiration of bees. He assisted Jean Senebier in his Mém. sur l'influence de l'air, etc., dans la germination (Geneva, 1800); and he also wrote \"Mém. sur l'origine de la cire\" (Bibliothèque britannique, tome xxv.), a \"Lettre a M. Pictet sur certains dangers que courent les abeilles\" (Bib. brit. xxvii), and \"Nouvelles Observ. rel. au sphinx Atropos\" (Bib. brit. xxvii). He died at Lausanne on 22 December 1831. A. P. de Candolle gave his name to a genus of Brazilian trees—Huberia burma.

A clash of egos with equally headstrong director Jeremy Wilcox sets the stage for \"Cloggin'-it Charlie\" Woodend, a painstaking and seemingly dull-witted police detective assigned to find out who planted a screwdriver in star Valerie Farnsworth, leaving her \"dead on cue\" during a live broadcast. Ignoring troubles at home (his daughter has fled to the nightlife of London), the lead-footed inspector dutifully interviews all sorts of scheming characters drawn from television's tawdry world in his determination to solve what becomes a double murder case after Houseman is also done in. Jealous police officials connive against each other, while Charlie remains above it all, just doing his job. Spencer melds her characters' spoken words and inner thoughts seamlessly, and nimbly makes scene changes to places as far away as the California coastline. Descriptions of melancholy English moorlands are reminiscent of Conan Doyle, as is the inspector's sudden revelation of the culprit in a tense final scene, occurring just before an improbable happily-ever-after epilogue.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It would have been a heavily footnoted work and that probably would have driven readers crazy. This version solves the problems without the footnotes by putting almost all the dialogue in English.

Lee considers herself fortunate to have been able to apply her deep love of film and the English language to fifty-five years of working in television, radio and film. She was awarded the first drama prize ever given in South Africa for her play A Candle in the Heart , written when she was outraged by what was happening politically in the country.  Her feature films, books, documentaries, novels and stories are all a tribute to Lee’s ethics, love of nature and the human community. At the age of 78, Lee’s desire to share the richness of her career was realized when she began teaching creative writing, thereby helping others to write their own stories. She takes immense pleasure in watching them blossom.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The day does not end smoothly when\n the couple finds the dead body of an old acquaintance in their motel\nroom. Their main suspects are from the police force. Roger and Suzanne\nhave a murder to solve and corruption to expose. The Body in the Bed is\npart of the South American Mystery Series by Jerold Last.I could never resist a novella as I like its comfortable length.\nTherefore, The Body in the Bed is no exception. I was quickly captivated\n from the very beginning. Even though the pacing is fast, the plot does\nnot seem rushed at all. It is actually very compact and flawlessly\nwritten with its international conspiracy, which is very impressive.\nTogether with a strong dialogue, author Jerold Last also presents\nreaders with vivid portrayals of the Uruguayan culture through his\nadroit prose. It is not hard for me to gravitate toward the main\nprotagonists, Roger and Suzanne. As a matter of fact, all the\ncharacters, main or secondary, are well-developed and believable. The\nstory itself is quite riveting; I finished it in one sitting because I\nreally wanted to know the outcome.All things considered, a very well constructed mystery sleuth for fans\nof the genre. I could actually see South American Mystery as a\ntelevision series. Jerold Last is a gifted writer and I would keep an\neye on his future works.", "related": [], "rank": 1579690, "title": "The Body in the Bed (Roger and Suzanne South American Mystery Series Book 5)", "author": "Jerold Last", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.3333, "rating_total": 26.0}

From the first bear to the last, the paintings are magnificently tinted and full of old world charm. But as a counting book, this is a muddle. Sometimes the bears are to be counted, sometimes they're playing or working with a set number of objects. For the young reader, it might be hard to pick out the four blue eggs in one picture, or the six shells in another, or the 10 clouds that look like fluffy lambs. The artist has hidden Roman numerals in the illustrations to tip off the reader, yet even some of these are difficult to find at first. While the text is lackluster, it does help ascertain what is being counted by which bear. Much work and care went into the creation and design of this book, but one is left wishing that author and artist had taken steps to make this the knock-out counting book it deserved to be.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Andrew Pace (pen name) found himself in midlife crisis recovering financially and emotionally from a  divorce, he vowed to make changes in his approach to life and love.  Over the next ten years, he experienced four serious relationships in which, contrary to his prior behavior of primarily seeking his own satisfaction, he concentrated on pleasuring his partners first.  To sharpen his lovemaking skills, he made mental notes of the sexual techniques which seemed to please each partner the most. He eventually summarized them into a book which he named Delightful Hands.  It is a compilation of ways a man can use his hands to enable his partner to achieve bigger, better, and more orgasms.  This approach radically changed his sex life for the better, increased intimacy, and fostered a much closer relationship with his partners.  He believes Delightful Hands can do the same for any couple.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Madison came into being.  The\ncombination of their lust and fiery passions fused into this one erotic\nbeing.  Or so says mythology.", "related": ["B00APM2MEU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was brother to the more well-known Andrew Bonar, and with him defended D. L. Moody's evangelistic ministry in Scotland. He authored a couple of excellent revival works, one including over a hundred biographical sketches and the other an addendum to Rev. John Gillies' Historical Collections bringing it up to date. Horatius was in fact one of eleven children, and of these an older brother, John James, and a younger, Andrew, also became ministers and were all closely involved, together with Thomas Chalmers, William C. Burns and Robert Murray M'Cheyne, in the important spiritual movements which affected many places in Scotland in the 1830s and 1840s. In the controversy known as the \"Great Disruption,\" Horatius stood firmly with the evangelical ministers and elders who left the Church of Scotland's General Assembly in May 1843 and formed the new Free Church of Scotland. By this time he had started to write hymns, some of which appeared in a collection he published in 1845, but typically, his compositions were not named. His gifts for expressing theological truths in fluent verse form are evident in all his best-known hymns, but in addition he was also blessed with a deep understanding of doctrinal principles. Examples of the hymns he composed on the fundamental doctrines include, \"Glory be to God the Father\".....on the Trinity. \"0 Love of God, how strong and true\".....on Redemption. \"Light of the world,\" - \"Rejoice and be glad\" - \"Done is the work\" on the Person and Work of Christ. \"Come Lord and tarry not,\" on His Second Coming, while the hymn \"Blessed be God, our God!\" conveys a sweeping survey of Justification and Sanctification. In all this activity, his pastoral work and preaching were never neglected and after almost twenty years laboring in the Scottish Borders at Kelso, Bonar moved back to Edinburgh in 1866 to be minister at the Chalmers Memorial Chapel (now renamed St. Catherine's Argyle Church). He continued his ministry for a further twenty years helping to arrange D.L. Moody's meetings in Edinburgh in 1873 and being appointed moderator of the Free Church ten years later. His health declined by 1887, but he was approaching the age of eighty when he preached in his church for the last time, and he died on 31 May 1889.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the first book, the father of the Beverley girls literally kills himself attempting to keep the house in the family, but the girls still lose their family home. The house possesses its previous owners and somehow makes them believe that nothing is more important than living in Mannerling. Those that have lived there once must return, at any cost. Despite warnings from her older sisters (who both attempted to regain Mannerling, at the cost of their own happiness) Abigail Beverley is the third daughter to try to reclaim Mannerling. She plans to marry the new owner, despite his wretched reputation.  Fortunately, Miss Trumble, the infallible governess, and the handsome Lord Burfield teach Abigail the true meaning of love, and she, like her two older sisters, discovers there is more to life than Mannerling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Following the Liberation, he completed his education and graduated in Political Science from the Sapienza University in Rome. He worked as a journalist and on computer technology, but eventually decided that he was more interested in people than in bytes. He became a manager in the personnel department at Olivetti, and then the director of human resources at Mondadori. He is the author of four novels and the winner of the Dino del Bo literary prize. In 2006 he also won the Ultima Frontiera literary prize for Of Jewish Race, which is now also published in an edition for the Italian schools.

After an introduction to the field of forensics, the remaining six chapters look at how evidence is found, identified, and interpreted. \"Fingerprints,\" \"Blood,\" and \"Bones and Bodies\" focus on physical evidence. The last three chapters consider other types of evidence including residues and forgeries but not cybercrime. Each chapter opens with an anticipatory question. Generous side columns are filled with \"Forensic Facts,\" explanations of forensic careers, and other miscellaneous information. Cartoon illustrations mostly fill up space and sometimes work against the text. The \"Inquire & Investigate\" activities that conclude each chapter are closely tied to the topic and will give readers hands-on \"behind-the-scenes\" experience. The instructions can get dense but are not overly technical. The most involved projects are perhaps the DNA extraction activity and the \"Shoe Print Impressions.\" A few activities use open flames and some require readers to find their own recipes for ingredients but provide no URL suggestions. Frequent charts and occasional graphs are needed for record keeping and analysis but no examples are provided. A complete glossary explains the many forensics specific terms. The total package is worthy of consideration.-Carol S. Surges, formerly at Longfellow Middle School, Wauwatosa, WIα(c) Copyright 2013.

Reid scoured historical archives to write this full account of Harper as a theater performer, choreographer, director and producer. Born the son of a poor singer in Birmingham, Ala., Harper performed on the street for pennies as a child. He became a talented performer, and after his father died, he studied soft-shoe in an effort to provide for his family. Reid writes of his grandfather at age 10: He \"was now a first class dancer who could tap rings around most of the adults and veteran masters. In other words, young Harper be boggity-boggity.\" Reid continues with similarly charming turns of phrase as he shares the details of Harper's exploits. Young Harper traveled with vaudeville shows until he found his way to New York, where he went solo at 16. By his early 20s, he found himself at the center of the Harlem Renaissance, and he worked with such legends as Duke Ellington, Florence Mills, Thomas \"Fats\" Waller and Louis Armstrong. Reid provides a straightforward account of the era's racial tensions, with white producers often swindling Harper and his fellow African-American theater professionals out of the rights to their works. However, Harper was resourceful enough to successfully stage dozens of shows. Reid chronicles his barrier-breaking achievements, including his 1929 debut of Hot Chocolates, an African-American production that received great acclaim on Broadway. Though the book is full of praise for Harper, Reid also recounts his grandfather's extramarital affairs and some of the more colorful stories of gangsters and burlesque dancers in the Harlem nightclub scene. An entertaining biography that circles the theater and taps into an important cultural movement.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

David's stardom rises with a streak of winning games that attract the attention of college scouts and media. Tyler becomes bitter, and David forms a friendship with Jon. Through his senior English class journal, David struggles with feelings for his new friend that he doesn't know how to interpret. Jon evokes something in him like no one else has before, including his girlfriend.

She wanted her children to learn about Jesus, so she began reading them story books about the Bible.  It surprised her at how much she didn’t know.  Then one night in 2001, she awoke from a dead sleep with the thought of writing her own children’s books.  She knew how much her sons had learned about the Bible from the stories she read them.   The main character would be Rufus, their Shepherd-Akita dog.  Each book would bring to life the minor characters of the Bible, such as the boy who shared his bread and fish that fed the 5000.  That week, 2 books were written. Unfortunately life took over and the stories were forgotten.  After suffering some devastating losses, including the death of her husband and the closure of her business, the stories resurfaced in 2010.  Lorraine’s current husband, a pastor, happened to come across the stories one evening and loved them.  It was through his encouragement that Lorraine continued to write several more stories.  If you ask her, she will tell you that these are in fact ”God’s stories, I’m just his assistant.”  Lorraine and her husband reside in Phoenix, AZ.  Her boys,Conner and Dylan Lantz, are now adults living in Orange County, CA.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thomas easily digs deeply into its core to reveal both the essential wisdom and the heart-felt compassion that all true sages embody when they are genuinely engaged in the world. The first time Thomas heard these nondual teachings was when he attended one of Timothy Conway’s satsang in 2005. (“Satsang” means “Divine assembly” or “association in Truth” and it is the traditional forum for the nondual perspective.) Thomas continues to attend these weekly meetings and they provide the foundation for all his writing. Thomas teaches his book, Living the Paradox of Enlightenment, as a class for the Center for Lifelong Learning, which is a part of Santa Barbara City College, the highest ranked community college in the United States. In September 2012, Thomas spoke for the prestigious lecture series, Mind and Supermind, which is run by SBCC. Graham Hancock selected Thomas as his Author of the Month for March 2012. Thomas has spoken publicly numerous times, both in person and on the radio.

There is more to\nthe Basher than the plodding big man, ever set on his tasks, or the unshakeable\nand unmovable soldier that I portrayed in those novels that came before this\nwork. My greatest challenge was to pry open Barag's outer armor and look inside\nhis suit, to find what makes up his thought processes. I was surprised and\npleased by what I found.

They make it to a port where Jack, through bullying and bribery, gains passage for them and a cabin for Kathy, unbeknownst to them, displacing Juan and Elena Soto, a Chilean miner and his pregnant wife. Once in California, Jack and Wade have little to show after months of mining. Wade decides to tough it out; Jack turns to professional gambling and kills a man who accuses him of cheating. 126 Kathy, having learned on her arrival that she is a widow, survives by running a hotel for miners until the formerly prim woman discovers she has a talent for singing. The tale entertains through its sheer variety of characters who act honorably and despicably, living in affluence and desperate poverty; yet their stories are not complete until they encounter Juan Soto, who is determined to exact revenge for the prejudice he and Elena have endured.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": 59638, "title": "California Kingdoms", "author": "Robert Broomall", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although her citizenship certificate now reads the United States of America, she considers herself a citizen of the world. Sure she has not physically been around the world and back, but she's travelled in her mind and dreams. Janice is also the proud mother of teenage boys. Janice is an author. She enjoys writing about social issues and personal experiences. Janice's debut release was entitled Damaged Girls. She uses the three books in that series to detail the effects of different forms of abuse, discussing issues that are known to be taboo. Her latest release, Jumping Ship, is a dedication to her country of birth and an introductory novella to the Island Hopping Series - due out in 2014. It's poised to be a colorful and emotional experience of life, love and family. Janice enjoys reading. And is drawn to stories with distinct characters that she can love or hate, characters she can form alliances with or characters that she can swear off and despise. She is also weak for a good cultural tale, preferably in the form of historical fiction. Janice loves to be taken off guard by clever language and settings. Janice is also a devout supporter and promoter of other authors through social media. She hosts a weekly show, Cultural Cocktails, on the largest social radio network, Blog Talk Radio.

The result is a compelling case for why philosophical naturalism, including its cousin, nominalism, must be rejected by anyone who sincerely seeks after moral knowledge. Smith's greatest accomplishment in this book, however, is the way in which he interacts, at a high level, with contemporary philosophical schools of thought and ancient traditions in a way fully accessible to the educated layman and college student.\" (Francis J. Beckwith, Baylor University)\"While ancient and medieval philosophy agrees with Scripture that moral knowledge is possible, the fallout of both modernism and postmodernism is a debilitating moral skepticism. Against this, Smith shows these worldviews to be self-defeating, and defends an ontology of embodied souls and moral essences grounded in God, which rehabilitates the idea of moral knowledge. Anyone dismayed by our culture's creeping nihilism will be encouraged by this important, insightful and timely study.\" (Angus Menuge, president of the Evangelical Philosophical Society)\"Building on arguments advanced in his two earlier books, R. Scott Smith makes a powerful, carefully reasoned case forreal knowledgeof the world, moral values and principles. Along the way he presents an insightful history of Western ethics designed to show the many ways in which ethics has gone wrong, especially in separating itself from factual moral knowledge, resulting in today's relativistic approach to knowledge in general and to moral knowledge in particular. Arguing further that moral knowledge cannot be grounded in any form of naturalistic metaphysics, Smith contends that objective moral values (virtues) and principles (duties) must be transcendentally grounded in the character of God, specifically the God of biblical revelation, finally the God of Christianity. Smith writes precisely and persuasively but not dogmatically, and clearly invites and often articulates counterarguments at every turn.  The book sets the standard for anyone who is drawn to affirm a universal ethic grounded in the character of God.\" (John P. Crossley, Jr., University of Southern California)\"Scott Smith has done an admirable job of surveying the ethical landscape both past and present. And he both challenges various forms of relativism and naturalism that are so corrosive to moral knowledge and quite effectively dismantles the commonly assumed arguments for the fact-value split. Also, he carefully constructs a case for the foundations of moral knowledge. In doing so, he offers much-needed wise guidance in an era that increasingly calls such knowledge into question.\" (Paul Copan, Palm Beach Atlantic University)\"R. Scott Smith's In Search of Moral Knowledge brilliantly argues that objective moral knowledge is possible and that this kind of knowledge is grounded in the character of the Christian God. This bold assertion runs counter to much of what is widely accepted in contemporary ethical scholarship. But Smith is undaunted. He meticulously explores origins of contemporary relativistic ethical theories (in which the so-called 'fact-value split' is fundamental), and he claims that these theories simply cannot stand up to close philosophical scrutiny. In Search of Moral Knowledge will be used by ethical theorists and students for a long time. Smith builds on a deep knowledge of the history of ethical thought. But his straightforward writing style assures that his arguments will be accessible to people who are just beginning to reflect seriously on their own moral experience.\" (John Orr, emeritus professor of religion, University of Southern California)\"Over the years, Scott Smith has, time and time again, demonstrated deep insight into the underlying causes of our contemporary cultural chaos. InIn Search of Moral Knowledge,he has, once again, put his finger on the pulse of the fount of society's moral ills. Smith rightly points out that moral knowledge, and not merely moral belief, is what is needed to live a proper life and form a virtuous society. And he locates the denial of moral knowledge in the views of reality promoted by various extant lines of thought. This is no mere ethics text, examining moral issue after moral issue. This is one of the few books by an evangelical that lays bare the underlying metaphysics and epistemology that generate the various streams of moral thinking today. This should be a text in any ethics class, and I wish for it a wide distribution.\" (J. P. Moreland, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, and author of Love Your God With All Your Mind)\"Scott Smith has produced a powerful new tool for Christian moral apologetics. He clarifies the veracity and strength of received moral wisdom both Christian and classical. He exposes the self-defeating vacuous nature of contemporary moral illusions. And he defends the objective reality of known moral truth grounded in the one true God and accessible to all bearing the imago Dei regardless of culture, feeling or locality. I will use this book with my students and urge others do the same.\" (Daniel Heimbach, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The massive injuries he and his wife sustained are minor compared to the anarchy and social disintegration that is now the norm, firmly established around them. The world has lost all electrical resources which has effectively stripped society of every service that it typically took for granted. What caused this is something that Conrad is duty-bound to discover. His appearance gives him the edge, as he strives to make sense of the world around him. His injuries from the accident serve him well in this new world where you need every means possible in order to live through the day.The world is a place of unimaginable horrors, not the least of which is cannibalism. Degradation and disorder reign, as each person fights for the right to live. One cannot imagine friendship in this cruel place, and yet, despite all odds, it can be found. The story contains graphic detail as horrific cruelty is encountered along the road that Conrad must travel. His daughter is missing amid the chaos, and he frantically holds on to finding her alive. He is driven by his grief and the massive losses he has suffered. His quest is to save as many as he can and re-establish order.The book gives a chilling account of how quickly we, as humans, can become vicious, self-sustaining brutes when our very survival is being threatened. We best hope that we are never privy to this horror - that it never becomes our reality. Powerful. Horrific. Nevertheless, a real page-turner.", "related": [], "rank": 1911890, "title": "Conrad Scott", "author": "Sean Patrick Sayers", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Your jeans don't fit anymore. You're sick of being overweight. You used to be able to lose weight but what worked then doesn't work anymore. You lose weight and you gain it all back, then some. Sound familiar? We've tried it all. We've bought the books, hired the trainers, maybe even tried HCG. Every diet and piece of advice makes sense, yet we can't seem to FOLLOW any of it. We have all the discipline in the world when we need it least, and it's gone when we need it most. We wake up early and go running for an hour, then that night we eat pizza, a burger, or a pint of ice cream. I managed to make major changes to my life and habits as a result of rapid weight loss, and I've written a book to tell you how I made it work! Thank you for visiting my author page! My name is Eric Stoddard, and I recently released my first book, 30 Pounds in 40 Days, which is available now on Amazon.com for the Kindle. I never thought I would lose weight as quickly as I did, while changing my habits, and I certainly never thought I would write a weight loss book. But I did lose the weight, with the help of a great nutritionist, a solid plan, and a million and one tricks I made up along the way to keep my evil twin from coming out and ruining it. I found a way to do it, and I want to share everything about it with you. I'm no expert in nutrition. I'm not a dietician and I'm not a doctor. I'm a regular guy who works in an office and who was attending graduate school. I have a busy schedule like you, and, like you, I struggled with my weight. But I managed to lose 30 pounds in 40 days. This book is what my journal grew into. It's the story of my transformation, and I'm sharing it with you here. Thank you very much for reading about my first release, and feel free to contact me using the information included here!

These stories, with an introduction by Walter Mosley, will be a joy for Butler’s many readers.” —Library Journal“Striking social commentary underscores the action in two dark, previously unpublished stories from the late sci-fi master. . . . A small but important addition to the oeuvre of a writer deeply concerned with issues of race and gender.” —Kirkus Reviews, starred review“One of the finest voices in fiction—period. . . . Butler casts an unflinching eye on racism, sexism, poverty and ignorance and lets the reader see the terror and beauty of human nature.” —The Washington Post Book World“What we have in these stories is actually something less like a childhood photograph, or juvenilia, or apocrypha, and more like the miraculous discovery that the beloved book you’ve read a dozen times has an extra chapter you’ve somehow never noticed. These stories don’t feel different; they feel like just her.” —Los Angeles Review of Books“In both stories Butler is able to create a whole world and a whole history out of very few words, by centering them on women who suffer no illusions about the worlds and circumstances they live in. She addresses race and class head-on as well as in metaphorical terms.” —NPR Books", "related": [], "rank": 54790, "title": "Unexpected Stories eBook", "author": "Octavia E.

Jake splits his time between Las Vegas where he is a partner in a security/bodyguard company, and his ranch outside of Elko, Nevada where he is just beginning to realize the dreams of his childhood.Samuel Davis Reardonis Jake's younger brother by two years and the two men so closely resemble each other that they are often mistaken for twins. Davis is currently employed with the Texas Rangers but visits Jake in Nevada when he can.Michael James Cavanaughis the Sheriff of Clark County, Nevada. Michael met Brinley in Texas under less than fortunate circumstances during the time he held the position of Sheriff in the county where she lived. Little did he know that their paths would cross again in Nevada.Tommy Joe Brandenis a popular country music star who grew up with Brinley and was best friends with her late brother. After his death Tommy took it as his responsibility to fulfill the role of 'big brother' for her and her younger brother.Ronald Casey Williamsis Brinley's younger brother, the baby of the family. With the rest of their family gone, Brinley and Casey only had each other and Tommy. Casey is a college student working towards his dream of becoming a veterinarian, but sometimes dreams change.Jace Garrett (Bo) Cantonis Jake's ranch foreman. Bo was the first man Jake hired and he's been with him ever since. Polite and sort of shy, he'd been a loner most of his life, never staying in one place too long...but no more.Lonnie Case Howardis another ex-Texas Ranger and Jake's partner in their security/bodyguard company based in Las Vegas. Lonnie left the Rangers before Jake and bounced around the country for a while until he eventually landed in Las Vegas.You will meet each of these men in Jake's story. You will learn more about each one through their own stories. Only they can tell you how one chance meeting ultimately leads them all through an intricately interwoven web of hope, love, heartache, lies, deceit, and murder.
