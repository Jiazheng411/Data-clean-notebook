The breakout was initiated by Viktor Pestek, a Romanian of German extraction and a guard at the camp who fell in love with an inmate. To lay the groundwork for the rescue of this Jew and her aged mother, Pestek arranged for himself and Lederer to escape in order to procure forged release documents. They made their way to Lederer's native Czechoslovakia, where the ex-prisoner's contacts made it possible for them to survive. On returning to Auschwitz to accomplish their plan, Pestek was captured and killed; Lederer managed to flee, but the mission was scrapped. Kulka's account of this episode provides a searing delineation of the horrors of the Nazi regime. Photos.

Paul Johnson, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TXThis book covers the major theoretical orientations that have been influential in American sociology since the mid-twentieth century. These include symbolic interaction, phenomenological sociology and ethnomethodology, social exchange and rational choice theories, sociology of emotions, functionalism and neofunctionalism, conflict and critical theory, selected feminist theories, structuration theory, systems theory, sociobiology, selected sociology of culture perspectives, and major themes from postmodern orientations.The distinctions between micro, meso, and macro levels serve as the organizing framework, with the micro/macro distinction related to the contrast between agency and structure. The various theories and theorists are compared, contrasted, and integrated as appropriate in portraying the complex and multidimensional features of the social world. Everyday life examples enable students to apply these abstract ideas to personal experiences and current social issues.Distinctive features include:Summaries of major ideas of the classical stage theorists which serve as a foundation for contemporary theories, including previously neglected contributions of women theorists;A chapter on formal theory construction, with discussion of its relevance to both quantitative and qualitative data analysis and to the status of sociology as a multiple-paradigm discipline;Coverage of communities, complex organizations, markets, and socioeconomic classes as distinctive meso-level social formations;Integration of rational choice theory and sociology of emotions, with application to communities and complex organizations;Focus on contrasting perspectives within each major theoretical orientation, plus conceptual and analytical linkages among these different orientations;Cultural systems and sociobiological characteristics covered in separate chapters distinct from the micro/meso/macro levels of the social world;Explicit attention given to individual identities, personal relationships, social networks, groups, residential and other kinds of communities, internal and external organizational relations, impersonal market transactions, socioeconomic class distinctions, institutional structures, and international relations.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Addie is quite a fanciful young woman, spinning all sorts of wild tales and fantasies to liven up her rather dull life.  Then one starlit night, her Prince Charming comes riding up, wounded and in need of her assistance.  It turns out that her prince is a musician in a brass band--  and a southerner, too!  Why, it's as if he stepped right out of her dreams... and Addie doesn't intend to let him go.  Charley Wilde is no southern gentleman.  Sure, he's from Georgia, he's a carpenter and  the director of the brass band, but his intentions are hardly noble.  Charley's ragtag group depends on him and they've had to resort to theft to keep from starving to death.  They once served the confederacy proudly and vowed to stay together after the war.  But Georgia is a burned out shell overrun by carpetbaggers, so the America City Brass Band went west hoping to find jobs.  When Charley hears about the Blewitt family rubies, he formulates a plan to relieve the Blewitt ladies of their jewels and rob the local bank.  He figures that will be enough to help the band get settled somewhere.  What Charley doesn't count on is falling in love with Addie.  Wild Dream is a nice, lighthearted tale.  Addie is at times annoying rather than endearing with her constant prattle and wild imagination.  In fact, many of the characters seem to be playing with less than a full deck which makes for humorous scenes but not a lot of reader empathy.  However, Ms. Duncan does a nice job with developing the romance between Addie and Charley into something sweet and meaningful.Take a lighthearted romp through the old west with Alice Duncan. Quirky characters and a satisfying love story make Wild Dream a fun read!  A sweet summer treat! Alice Duncan has a talent for combining humor and history to create a one-of-a-kind romantic tale!Kristina Wright  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

Sitting in the park one day eating a popsicle, Jordan is suddenly launched into the future he had been manifesting in his mind. Finding himself lost and alone, he is shocked that he'd finally dreamed hard enough to make it come true. Found on the other side by a woman, she works to help bring him home, touching his soul in a way he will never forget. After dreaming himself back he learns to control this new talent, never forgetting what the woman had done for him and vowing to return the favor, even if it meant sacrificing his own life to do so. Now bound to Jordan by fate, Kenzie Ashcroft finds her life riddled with bad dreams. Every night when Kenzie falls asleep she wakes up to a parallel life where things are not only normal, but are eerily real. Struggling to keep the two worlds straight she grows up wondering how this happened to her and why, wondering who the shadow of a man growing up beside her really is. Thinking life is wonderful, Jordan begins changing Kenzie's fate, giving her everything she ever wanted and making her the woman he always thought she was meant to be. As he delves deeper into his web of time and space, however, fate sends him a curve ball and he finds that he is not alone. Followed by a girl with turquoise eyes and skin cold as death he struggles to learn who she is, what she does, and why she is here. As he gets to know this strange girl in the hopes of learning more about himself, Jordan finds that what he thought was the right thing was not in the end. In a desperate attempt to take back the wrongs he thought were right, Jordan takes the leap to trust the strange girl. It is then that Jordan's world begins to fall apart, or does it?

The women are close and discuss the gambling, alcoholism and \"Don Juanism\" of their men, even with the younger girls present; they encourage the girls always to remain able to support themselves and their children. Pearlman's gift for characterization shines through in her portrayal of her intelligent and charismatic father, who explains Freud to her and her brother at family dinners, which are often served late because he secretly visits his mistress after work. Following the sage advice of her female relatives, Pearlman travels, takes lovers and earns her M.S.W. to become a therapist/counselor. \"Determined not to redo my mother's marriage,\" she eventually marries an African-American football player and artist she is certain will remain faithful to her and to whom she can be faithful. After 30 years with him, and after having published a book on keeping the passion alive in a long-term marriage, however, Pearlman discovers her husband's affair with a married Japanese student in one of the university art courses he teaches. While the experiences of her clients in therapy hauntingly reflect her own, Pearlman gives herself one year to either save her marriage or end it. In compact sentences and chapters, Pearlman uses the present tense to bring scenes from all stages of her life to full-color vitality. This collection of vignettes coalesces into an immediate, personal story of depth and power, as gripping as a good novel.

Penny Bell is a brilliant 17-year-old musician living in New York City and writing music that uses emotionally-manipulative Extra-Low Frequency sound waves when she simultaneously discovers that her neighbor, an aging dancer named Ula obsessed with immortality, took Penny's music for use in her own work, and that Ula's apartment was broken into. Then Ula takes off, so Penny and a dubious character named Alessandro fly to Paris to find her. Most of the characters -- themselves mostly artists of one sort of another -- are living breathing flesh, but what follows is a surreal, almost disconnected series of episodes where occasionally the plot advances but amid a lot of descriptive touring of Paris and Rome, long-winded talks, sprinkles of untranslated French, and a sinister German doctor named Zut whose speaks in a distractingly phonetic accent. There are gems scattered throughout, including a cathartic moment where Ula's \"immortality\" is erased. But overall the book has the feel of fitting tightly into a niche, like a black-and-white avant garde film exploring light and shadow as much as human nature. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organizationEvery performance artist wants to knock his/her audience dead, and Penny was no exception--until, that is, she literally knocked several members of the audience at her big recital dead as a doornail. She's no Yoko Ono, though; it wasn't the musical performance that was awful. Penny's specialty, you see, was the use of extremely low frequency (ELF) waves. These things have been known to influence a person's mood and feelings, but the last thing Penny expected was to find her career all but ruined by a string of deaths in her ELF music wake. She has been studying her music ever since, living an isolated life of self-imposed exile, trying to unlock the secrets of her unique art form. Her life changes again after one of her neighbors disappears, and Penny finds herself in Europe trying to find the missing woman. Strangely enough, though, everything that happens seems to relate back in some way to her ELF wave music and research. In Over Her Head definitely has the makings of a good suspense novel full of intrigue and mystery. The subject of ELF waves is actually quite relevant, as the military has conducted its own research into the possibility of using ELF waves on the battlefield to incapacitate the enemy. The story also calls to mind Lovecraft's story The Music of Erich Zann, especially in terms of the strange power certain pieces of music seem to unleash from within...As long as the search for Penny's missing neighbor doesn't devolve into something silly or tiresome, I have to believe that In Over Her Head is a novel quite deserving of an audience. --Amazon Top ReviewerThe young prodigy Penny Bell, off beat in appearance and devoted to her work, lives in the same apartment as Ula Nova, in her forties. Ula is usually somewhat disdainful of Penny, but when Ula returns home one day to discover that her apartment has been broken into it is Penny she turns to. The very detailed and descriptive prose creates a vivid picture and reads very satisfyingly; that is not to say it necessarily flows with ease, but there is something very pleasing about the assemblage of words; it is enjoyable to read just for its own sake. The characters are precisely depicted, individual, and interesting, and in the case of the main characters eccentric. Even the incidental characters are carefully thought out and add colour. The dialogue is carefully observed and convincing. --Amazon Top Reviewer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I passed my fifth level black belt test on November 25, 1987, and became a master in Wing Chun Kung Fu and Chinese Ninja.    For years, I have studied martial arts. During those years, I’ve had the privilege to teach many girls and women. Most of these females ranged in age from eight to thirty. I have taught rape prevention seminars, and demonstrated the techniques that you will learn in this book. I know that these techniques are effective in women’s self-defense. I have taken in and instructed females who frankly seemed hopeless, yet after teaching them the basic concepts contained within this book, they left my private instruction with the confidence that they need never fear rape again. I didn’t always have the desire to teach women these rape prevention techniques. On the contrary, the first three years that I taught martial arts I concentrated almost exclusively on teaching men. However, in August of 1984 something happened to change that. I had just opened a small school in Salem Alabama. In an effort to increase business, I decided to teach a rape prevention seminar free to the public. In preparation for that seminar, I sought out literature on the topic, which I planned to quote at times during the seminar. As I studied that literature, I was stunned at the projected figures on the women who would probably be sexually assaulted at some point during their lifetime. Prior to that introduction to the facts, I confess that I was ignorant of the true scope of the problem. As I continued to absorb all the literature I could get my hands on during that period of research, something within me changed. I no longer wanted to do the seminar to drum up business. I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to do my part to help females of all ages learn to defend themselves against sexual offenders.  I contacted the martial arts Grandmaster who had trained me, and told him about what I wanted to attempt to accomplish. After a long conversation, he agreed to teach me the rape prevention techniques that I needed to know so that I could teach the best course possible.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We decided to write this book to help the reader not only understand the growing Hispanic market opportunities but effective business and marketing strategies we developed that target this ethnic group. The group is referred to as Generation Equis (pronounced: EH-kees) or Gen-Equis. The name represents those born after 1960 that are of Hispanic or Spanish origin. We use the Spanish pronunciation of the letter X - `Equis'. This is similar to the well known Generation X population born after 1960 but Gen-Equis is focused on the growing Hispanic population.We draw on a vast amount of knowledge gained over the years dealing with various cultures. Similar yet unique patterns are evident when marketing to, and doing business with, different cultures. This book is an introduction and a guide to how the reader and any business organization they touch can do better when selling, servicing or marketing to the Generation Equis population group. The focus of the book is how to effectively use the Internet to reach this group. We provide complete information on strategies that any business or individual that desires to use the Internet to reach this Generation Equis must understand.When writing this book we used real world knowledge. Some was painful to obtain and required countless hours and dollars to perfect. Through our personal and professional adventures we learned many lessons and will share those that apply to Generation Equis. We have traveled the country and the world on business and pleasure ventures. This enabled us direct exposure to and appreciation of many cultures in our country and around the world.We would like to thank the many people we have done business with and encountered over the years. We shared life experiences with many that helped us learn and understand more. They enabled the foundation for this book.There are far too many names to mention.

While not a perfect story by any means, the author managed to keep this contemporary interesting enough for me to keep reading and care about the characters. The overall feeling I had about this book was that it was enjoyable and affected me on many levels. It’s mainly a story about growth and opening up to new possibilities through love.Heart of Change started out great for me. I’m partial to a female protagonist who works in a profession considered immoral (sex trade) and who openly enjoys it. I especially like it when there’s no stereotypical justification given for it either to make the reader more sympathetic or comfortable like: using funds for school, an abusive past, they are psychologically damaged, etc. I’d rather read a character who unabashedly loves being a whore, stripper, or in this case, a porn star and makes no excuses.This story is written in first person present tense, which normally is hard for me to read. However, this gave significant insight into Simone’s head. She’s a deep and real person, not some fluffy bimbo. She gets that her relationship with Simon is hurting her. But she also has an attachment to him that she just can’t shake. Simone also self reflects about her life in general and how she acts, taking full responsibility for her actions, which is a character trait I admire.She loves being a porn star and has been able to compartmentalize that sex as just work having nothing to do with love and relationships. And it really hasn’t made her jaded about men and sex, although at the same time, because of it, she won’t date. I felt it good that she wasn’t portrayed as a flaky sex maniac, but as someone who has some self discipline and makes her own choices.Simone has been meeting up with a group of lesbians at a bar for 6 years every Friday night. This I liked also because I think it’s unusual that a group of lesbians would befriend a porn star, the very type of woman who perpetuates woman as sex objects, which those lesbian friends find objectionable. However, personally, I love the idea that people can meet as humans and go beyond differences like that to be friends. So this is also something I got off on in this story. Simone is made to feel welcome and comfortable even if she’s doing something they detest and she doesn’t hide or make excuses. They all accept each other knowing exactly what’s going on.Another break in the usual is that Geri, out of all the lesbian friends, is the most serious and intimidating and she scares Simone because she’s been the most outspoken against what Simone does. And yet, it’s Geri who Simone starts feeling something for and thinks is the most beautiful. Since we don’t get into the head of Geri due to POV, it’s hard to tell where she’s coming from. But she’s written as having some gender identification issues, which I also enjoyed because she wasn’t just a stereotypical butch type of lesbian.Geri herself is a top who likes to pack (wears a strap-on while going out), but feels self conscious about it. She’s very male-ish in her appearance but she never comes across as an aggressive butch type. In fact, she’s got her own stuff going on and is more insecure and tender than aggressive, even when she’s being dominant. She’s as complex a character as Simone and is vulnerable with relationship issues as well. So none of this is stereotypical, but came across as real. I feel most people are usually complex with huge contradictions so I like to read characters that don’t act in stereotypical ways. In this book that’s what we get.How Geri and Simone get together is very sweetly written. It’s rather poignant and emotionally honest, both of them feeling something for each other but both in foreign worlds; Simone never having been with a woman or even attracted to a woman, and Geri having feelings for a straight woman and a woman who does something Geri detests.Because of the attraction and love both women feel, they are forced to re-evaluate their own personal reality and what is true for them. For instance, not knowing the “lesbian” rules, Simone does something sexual to Geri that normally as a top she would never allow, but feels OK to let Simone do. And for Simone, being with Geri gets her in touch with that part of her that wants sex to mean something deep and spiritual.I think because both women are so out of their normal element, they can allow themselves to change and open up to new things about themselves that they normally wouldn’t do when operating in their normal worlds. The idea that change and growth can happen in love is big in this story, which was a positive for me.Obviously since this review is really long, there was a lot in it for me. It touched me on several levels and was not a easy breezy fluffy love story. While there is lots of sex in this story, I was more affected by the relationship dynamics and feelings between the women. I definitely recommend Heart of Change for anyone who wants a good f/f story that's not just about the sex.", "related": ["B00CK69NMI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Shy, 10-year-old Billy; his pet ferret, Zucchini; his sister, Emma; and his divorced father visit the prairie in this sequel to Zucchini (HarperCollins, 1982). This episodic tale is the story of that trip, with portions told from the cheery ferret's point of view. The journey gives Billy a chance to spend time with his actor father and to meet the scientists who are working with an endangered species of ferret. The boy wants to find out for certain whether Zucchini is one of that rare breed; if so, he would be forced to hand the animal over to the lab. Five-year-old Emma provides some comic relief to a rather involved plot. Billy's character develops slowly and the adults appear stiff and one-sided. All in all, this is an unexceptional animal adventure. Black-and-white sketches provide some humor. While the book does not have the vitality or charm of Beverly Cleary's The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Morrow, 1965) or Lynne Reid Banks's I Houdini (Doubleday, 1988), it will appeal to ferret lovers and fans of the first book.?Beth Tegart, Oneida City Schools, NYCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Because the essays are necessarily brief, they are strongest when the contributor's particular experience filtech historical reflection. Most mix the personal and predictive, and most arrive at predictable conclusions. The volume concentrates its attention on the United States, which seems myopic since Christianity burgeons in the global south. The book's American focus and the absence of any male voices incompletely address Christian feminism's future. Its rehearsal of familiar complaints and the repeated call by its contributors for creative integration of women's experience and leadership underscores their observation that work remains to be done.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the hands of Smurthwaite (Fine Old High Priests;Letter by a Half Moon), mid-century Portland, Ore., becomes a simple utopia, where neighbors knew neighbors (but did not intrude on their business), and kindness was the order of the day. Indeed, not one ugly incident mars the coming-of-age of protagonist Neal Rogers, which makes for some nostalgic moments but a not very compelling plot. Growing up as one of five children in a boxmaker's family, Neal experiences a loving Mormon childhood, full of the security of a stable home and a close-knit ward (congregation). Smurthwaite offers some sweet, even cloying, snatches of Mormon life, including a particularly endearing sketch about an awkward young couple who have to be urged into courtship by various members of the ward. However, the novella constantly switches from vignette to vignette, giving readers a paragraph of one and then confusing them with a paragraph of another, with very little to go on in the way of time frame, setting and character. The artistic result is a frenetic disorder that is precisely the opposite of the unhurried, cohesive sensibility Smurthwaite seeks to convey.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She later wrote three unpublished novels, developing her skills as a writer while living on a remote lighthouse during what she thinks of as her baby-making, basket weaving, beach-walking days.     In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition.     Over the years her love of storytelling and her curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also an accountant, a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and a popular international speaker with considerable media experience.     Vanessa and her husband have lived on an island in the Pacific Northwest since they returned from a two year sailing cruise to Mexico some years ago. Vanessa loves hearing from readers.", "related": ["B00ICL9X0C"], "rank": 2797596, "title": "The Moon Lady's Lover", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Apart from flying, sailing, scuba-diving, skiing, renovating classic cars and being a talented artist and writer, he has led an unusually exciting life as a soldier. This has varied from active service to negotiator extraordinary in Beijing to rescue the 1984 Anglo/Sino Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong. As the personal Military Advisor to Ghana's Flt Lt Jerry Rawlings, he assisted in the planning of the military intervention in Liberia in 1991. As the Defence Attachè in Jakarta, his highly successful expedition to unlock the mystery of what happened to the ill-fated 'Operation Rimau', the WW2 Australian commando raid on Japanese shipping in Singapore, received wide press coverage at the time. His first book, 'GWEILO' focuses on the return of Hong Kong to China. His second book, 'AL SAMAK' is about Saddam Hussein's efforts to obtain a WMD to prevent the invasion of Iraq by the coalition forces in 2003. The third book 'ASHANTI GOLD' uses his exciting exploits in West Africa as a colourful background to a novel that focuses on the famnine, chaos and corruption in the African Continent. The author's latest novel 'FIRE DRAGON' uses material from his experience as a Defence Attach&egrace; in Jakarta, where he travelled extensively from the remote areas of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya to the troubled Island of East Timor. This provided an ideal backdrop for a North Korean/Indonesian conspiracy to develop a nuclear weapon and the means of delivering it. Brian Nicholson is married with two adult daughters. He is now writing his fifth novel featuring john Gunn and continues to paint, play golf, ski, sail and restore classic cars.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For the past fourteen years she has lived in Portland, Oregon with her husband of forty-three years, their daughter and her family. She pursued a career as a health professional, but always made time for what she loved most, writing.           Re-current childhood dreams, unexplained visions and questions about life and death drove her to read about Edgar Casey and others who could transcend the physical plane. On her spiritual journey she took classes in Tarot, which opened her dyslexic mind to receive higher guidance.  Later she also obtained a degree as a certified Hypnotherapist, who specialized in past life regression.        When her son died in a tragic car accident at the age of 21, she longed to have an even greater understanding of the bigger picture of life.  Her son Irwin had written over forty songs, a screenplay and they had begun writing a children's book called Pizarus. Michele finished it and hopefully one day that too, will be published.          For the past several years to fine-tune her writing skills she joined Willamette Writers and attended workshops and conferences. After meeting a new friend in Oregon, who read some of her writing, she was asked to give life to the heart-wrenching story of her husband's murder.  Thus began her début novel, Blood, Money, Power, an epic political saga of wealth and greed that leads to murder and inspired by a true story.

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that\nwere richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril'sAlliance (upcoming in late 2012)CryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to\ncompletists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed HuntThe short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading! -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Largely self-taught, Nicholson began a newspaper career in 1884 at the Indianapolis Sentinel. He moved to the Indianapolis News the following year, where he remained until 1897. He wrote Short Flights in 1891, and continued to publish extensively, both poetry and prose until 1928. During the first quarter of the 20th century, Nicholson, along with Booth Tarkington, George Ade, and James Whitcomb Riley helped to create a Golden Age of literature in Indiana. Three of his books from that era were national bestsellers: The House of a Thousand Candle, The Port of Missing Men, and A Hoosier Chronicle.", "related": ["B004ZEYX5U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He gained favor with Sweden’s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII’s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The uniformly favorable review cited the novel’s unique and interesting storyline, and its recommendation to read is an affirmation of the authenticity of the work.///Editorial Review excerpts from “Books in Brief,” by David Willson, contributor to The VVA Veteran magazine, April 12, 2013:  “I found this novel totally engrossing from the first chapter.”….“Miller is both a gifted storyteller and a fine writer. So this reader was held rapt as Lt. Patrick transforms himself into a combat engineer.”….“Miller works his writerly magic to make every page of this book compelling reading.”….“This fine book reminded me of two classic novels of men and machines, or at least of men and construction: The Sand Pebbles by Richard McKenna and The Bridge on the River Kwai by Pierre Boule. Both were bestsellers and were made into classic movies…a movie made from Warrior, Wayfarer with Ryan Gosling in the starring role as Lieutenant Press Patrick would be one hell of an interesting and entertaining flick.”….“You won’t be disappointed if you spend a few hours with this book.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This sequel, a collaboration with his wife, focuses on women's psychosocial growth from the late teens to middle age (around age 45). It builds on interviews conducted in the early 1980s with 45 subjects-15 New Haven-area homemakers, 15 N.Y.C. corporate-financial career women and 15 academics in the New York-Boston corridor. Not surprisingly, the homemakers found traditional patterns difficult to sustain and often paid a big price in restrictions on self-development; career women experienced considerable stress and difficulty in breaking down barriers in formerly \"male\" occupations and in pushing for a more equitable division of housework. In contrast to the earlier book, this sequel's plodding, academic style and narrower focus may deter some readers, yet the outspoken oral testimonies convey a sense of women negotiating the challenges of career, love, marriage and family. 30,000 first printing.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Uncle Hank turns up and proves to be involved with a Chinese-American woman, 12-year-old Danny buys into the prevalent anti-Chinese sentiment and delays the melding of a new family. While the plot has possibilities, neither the descriptions of the boys' actions nor the occasional dialogue provide much insight into their personalities and the characters don't come to life. The period is well researched, but the historical information sometimes seem tacked on. Children read that \"like many of the other men, [Uncle Hank] was gradually growing deaf from the noise and from the beeswax melting into his eardrums,\" but at a critical point Uncle Hank is quick to hear pounding on his window and never in any scene exhibits hearing loss. Perhaps most unsettling of all, given the unmistakable anti-prejudice message, is the turning point that brings Danny to accept the love offered him. When his brother is critically ill, he goes to his uncle and aunt because \"he'd heard how Chinese have healing ways and he'd seen her bottles of herbs.\" The use of a stereotype at the apex of the plot weakens the theme. All in all, this title is much less compelling than Gregory's The Winter of Red Snow (Scholastic, 1996).?Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library District, Elgin, ILCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But is this a  case of a family exacting retribution for a daughter's shameful life, or  is there something else going on here? Santana-an appealing series  lead, strong and intelligent-has his hands full with an assortment of  suspects and, as it turns out, more than one body to deal with.

I even decorated a pawn shop, once! I have crafted 80% of the décor in my home and had a small craft business where I sold my items at craft shows.  I also had a time where I went through a divorce and lost love and home. It's not a good feeling. It takes something to get back on your feet, pull yourself up and continue on through this journey of life.  Through much prayer and time spent with the Lord, I overcame sadness, despair, depression and a lack for living.  Those years are behind me, now. Thank you, God.

You can see they were made for each other. And the animals, oh boy the animals. This book is full of great talking\nanimals that you will love instantly. My favorite was Noba, the pseudodragon.\nHe was so sweet and adorable and very helpful. There was a unicorn\nthat was actually quite the badass (that is by far the strangest thing I have\nsaid) and many more that make a huge impact on Lyra in the book. I applaud\nMoore for coming up with this world. It was truly epic.  Moore created\nsuch a great world that it left an impact on me. I was sad when the book ended\nbecause I wanted more.

Although it was tough, he worked on for thirteen years and finally had to stop because he developed arthritis in his left hand. All through his life he wanted to write a book, and with time on his hands that first book grew into three, The Spirit Trilogy: Spirit, Force and Parity. Next, The Hybrid Series: Split Decision, Critical Moments, Devil's Dyke and Wet Daddy. Medium Rare has just been released. Although each book has a unique crime and can be read as stand-alone, the back-story in the series rolls from one book to the other where you'll see them breaking new ground in the Police Force as well as witnessing their totally outrageous lifestyle. Harding is writing a spin-off hybrid book, online. ahardingbooks.com. HWSNBN (He Who Shall Not Be Named) Ch1-17 posted and over 30K chapters were read each month in 2013. The characters in this book meet with those in Book 5, Medium Rare, as they need help with their first horrendous case. Medium Rare and HWSNBN are interlaced in places, although written from two different perspectives and a writers dream job. Harding's life-long fascination with Crime, the Paranormal and the Supernatural has given him a huge amalgam to dip into, and more importantly a new lease on life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm Anne and I have a new life.I traded in a traditional career for a new life as an outdoor photographer and writer. I live in an RV and travel around North America photographing beautiful places. I write about travel, photography, and how changing your life is not as scary as it seems.When I first started photographing 20 years ago I lived in a darkness. My images were journalistic in style and focussed on problems in the world, sad stories, homeless people and I even had a whole series on graveyards. It is as if I lived in a world full of only bad things.I gave up photography for a long time as I focussed on my first career in software development and when I picked up a camera again my view of life began to change. By nature, I see all the negative things in the world. That comes easy. I have to put effort into seeing the good so I made a decision to only photograph beautiful things.Using photography to guide what I focus on every day is changing my outlook on life. Now I see the goodness and beauty in the world and it makes me a happier person.Two years ago I took another leap. I gave up my home in Victoria, BC, Canada, closed my software consulting business, bought an RV and hit the road for the life of a nomadic photographer. I wanted a happier more fulfilling life. I wanted the life I dreamed about. People tell me I am brave and they wish they could do what I did. For me, it felt like the only option that was right and good.I hope my story and images will inspire other people to change the way they view the world and the way they live their lives. Changing your life is not as difficult or scary as it seems! What is scary is not doing it.Today I am a successful photographer, author and teacher. My work has been published in instructional photography books, children's books, and several magazines including Canadian Geographic. I am the author of four photography eBooks.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 39, "rating_average": 4.5897, "rating_total": 179.0}

With great persuasive power, he details the ambiguities and paradoxes, affiliations and disaffiliations that marked the lives of real people caught in the maw of colliding worldviews, land grabs and racial barriers.\" --The Christian Century\"Accessible, well written, and founded on thorough research. Recommended.\" --CHOICE\"This fine book reconstructs Native encounters with Christianity in southeastern New England from 1700 to 1820. Rather like the Indian Great Awakening itself, decades of important, pathfinding, and innovative work have preceded it, shaped it, and made it possible. A worthy and admirable contribution to that.\" --Joel W. Martin,American Historical Review\"A nuanced reading of the Native American experience of Christianity during the eighteenth century .The Indian Great Awakeningdoes an impressive job of capturing the complexity of Native American 'religious engagement.' Gracefully written, the book should attract a broad range of readers interested in Native America, early America, and religious history.\" --R. Todd Romero,Journal of American History\"Linford D. Fisher's... study of Indigenous Christianity makes a significant contribution to our understanding of both colonial approaches to Indigenous peoples and their own repurposing of them. Fisher challenges historians to deconstruct colonial religion by questioning whether conversion is the most important indicator for understanding Indigenous engagement with Christian cultures. Rather than focusing on conversion, he suggests seeing religion as a lived and elastic experience, placing greater attention on religious affiliation and engagement with colonial institutions.\" --Thomas Peace,Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History\"Largely convincing and highly intriguing.\" --Gregory Evans Dowd,New England Quarterly\"Linford Fisher's reexamination of New England Native Americans' encounters with Christianity during the eighteenth century shifts us away from sterile old debates. Abandoning either-or categories of 'conversion' and 'resistance,' he discovers people who negotiated the treacherous waters of colonialism by selectively borrowing, adapting, and making their own what missionaries and their government sponsors attempted to force upon them.\" --Daniel K. Richter, author ofBefore the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts\"Linford Fisher's masterful narrative demonstrates Christianity's importance for Native Americans in eighteenth- century New England. Showing how Native Americans maintained their identity and ongoing presence through religion, this lucid and thorough study makes a real contribution to historical studies of early New England.\" --Amanda Porterfield, author ofConceived in Doubt: Religion and Politics in the New American Nation\"A superb book. The revival known as the Indian Great Awakening may not have been as dramatic as historians have assumed, but The Indian Great Awakening is as insightful as historians could have hoped.\"--Erik R. Seeman,Church History\"By putting Indians at the center of the Great Awakening, provincial America's quintessential cultural event, Linford Fisher shatters the divisions that have separated American Indian, colonial, and religious history.  His deep research and vivid authorial voice capture the depth of New England Indians' engagement with Christian revivalism as they confronted a hostile colonial world.  Our understanding of the Awakening and the Indian experience reaches new heights in Fisher's able hands.\" --David J. Silverman, George Washington University\"Linford Fisher offers a compelling account of how Indian people in south-central New England and eastern Long Island embraced Christianity during the eighteenth century, not in hopes of becoming integrated into Anglo-American society and culture but rather of ensuring their survival and strengthening their distinct identities as Indians.  Fisher's most important revelation is the extent of Indian Christians' separation from-and their criticism and even defiance of-Anglo-American Christians.  No longer will we be able to write off Native American Christians as brainwashed traitors to their people and cultures.\"--Neal Salisbury, Smith College", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a murder mystery centered in a dilapidated hotel in North Scranton, Pennsylvania; a place the late Harry Chapin once politely described as \"that coal scarred city\". Ethan Holmes just released a new title, Live Your Life in a Crap Free Zone. It gives the reader a revealing and often humorous look at the relationships in our lives. When he is not writing Ethan pursues such varied interests as twelve string guitar, Civil War history, most sports, reading and fitness.

Returning from India, she has the good fortune to be the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and in order to avoid the marriage, she takes on the identity of her traveling companion, Sarah Morecroft. Sarah was returning to England to take up the position of governess to the children of urbane MP Roland Hawthorne, and so this is what Lady Sarah must also do. She soon finds that it is not as easy as she had imagined, especially when Roland is so attractive...and so single!I enjoyed this twist on the old gothic novel standby plot of the governess in the mysterious household. This imaginative writer stands a lot of the expected clichés on their heads and treats the reader to something rather different and refreshing. Spoilt Lady Sarah has some lessons to learn, as does man-with-a-past Roland and his \"ugly duckling\" daughter Caro. There are some surprising turns in this novel and the characters find themselves in rather more peril than might be surmised by reading the above description. The ending is a bit far-fetched in some respects, but don't let that put you off diving into this talented new writer's debut novel. If you think standard Regencies need a bit of shaking up, then this might fit the bill.The BookRobert HaleJune 2009Hardback0709087772 / 9780709087779Historical Romance / 1819 / England", "related": [], "rank": 580631, "title": "Lady Sarah's Redemption", "author": "Beverley Eikli", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.4, "rating_total": 34.0}

Endless horror stories—from tainted pet food to railroad disasters—severely undermine the nation's aspirations and, as a result, China now finds itself at a critical juncture: it can adopt a more sustainable approach that will allow it to continue as a dynamic powerhouse, or it can fall far short of its incredible potential.InChina Fast Forward: The Technologies, Green Industries and Innovations Driving the Mainland's Future,China business expert Bill Dodson takes an in-depth look at the sustainability challenges facing the country as it works to become a global economic leader. Exploring the Chinese approach to innovation—which relies heavily on reverse-engineering foreign technologies, rather than encouraging domestic creativity—and the ways in which heavy industry and new brands are being leveraged to build international standing, the book incorporates personal anecdotes and interviews to bring modern China vividly to life.If the country is to continue to develop, it needs to improve its ability to generate cleaner, more efficient energy to power its booming industries. China is already moving away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable resources that will allow for true energy independence, and this book shows how, by embracing alternative sources and beginning to address pollution concerns, the country is coming to grips with the value of green power.China's path towards superpower status is littered with obstacles. Government intervention is a constant threat to real progress, but the country is meeting global challenges on a scale that few nations can match. As China ponders how to respond to the impediments to its potentially golden future,China Fast Forwardtakes a look at what lies ahead, and why China's successes and failures hold important lessons for us all.", "related": [], "rank": 1424537, "title": "China Fast Forward: The Technologies", "author": "Bill Dodson", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His power not just making being a hero available to him, but forcing it upon him, without any of the standard perks that normally come with the job in fictional settings.He's thrust into the violence and then has to do anything he can to survive, regardless of how he feels about it. It makes for a slightly dark tale. Then, just because I'm cool that way, I left him with all the normal problems a twenty-three year old would have, and plunked him down in a world where he was automatically hated, just for existing. (You're welcome Brian...)In other words, if he ever comes to life, he's going to kick my hind-end with prejudice!But I hope you enjoy the book.

Far from being so, listening analytically is an essential skill that may take the analyst years to learn and is a skill that would seem to be unteachable. Salman Akhtar has taken up the challenge and demonstrates, in this masterful volume, how complex and multifaceted is this seemingly simple act. He reveals with brilliant clarity the many modes in which the analyst may listen to his patient and listen to himself while with his patient, and he provides the student a theoretical and practical base from which to learn to listen 'like an analyst'.\"\"In this slim but remarkable volume, Salman Akhtar has recast psychoanalysis, the renowned 'talking cure', as essentially a 'listening cure'. Like a virtuoso musician, he guides us to better discern the sounds and silences of the analytic hour. His book is replete with experience-near vignettes and contains numerous pearls of clinical wisdom. It is bound to become another classic in the Akhtar tradition!\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She opened a dusty door in the basement, not knowing what was behind it--and revealed to everyone's startled eyes a private little S&M chamber, complete with whips, chains, the works.

He pursues tangents and “rabbit trails” to the point of exhaustion because he believes it is only when we break the meaningless layers of surface information do we begin to gain an inkling of what it means to be human. Derek and his wife Leah, married for over a dozen years, are the proud parents of three wonderful kids: Hannah, 9, Avila, 7, and Lincoln, 5. Derek is an attorney, college professor, and part-time cartographer. Beginning with a newspaper route at age 14, he has worked his way through life, picking up a little knowledge and wisdom from great people at every stop. Derek’s done everything from part-time mailman to real estate agent to BBQ restaurant waiter to door-to-door Bible salesman to certified strength and conditioning coach. Along the way, he’s learned from the inside out how the experiences of various occupations inform and influence our culture. He even spent a few months in 1996 moonlighting at an apartment renovation project, picking up broken drywall for hours on end. He didn’t learn much there, except that education was important. Which partly explains why he has spent almost his entire life in school (he also simply loves the smell of books), either as a teacher or student. Not satisfied with picking up nearly 30 credits more than necessary to finish his bachelor’s degree in Psychology, Derek went on to earn a Masters in Education and his Juris Doctor. While practicing law is occasionally fun and sometimes interesting, it’s Derek’s love for words that brought him to his current adventure, full-time author. Now, creating characters and worlds consumes him, because stories are the stuff of life. And life is a story. Well-told and well-lived are just different expressions for the same thing, and Derek’s stories are meant to inspire every reader to pursue a life well-lived. To pursue dreams and to bring those dreams to life – that’s the point of living. And that’s the point of Derek Holser.", "related": ["B00CP8N5ZW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After one semester in college on a football scholarship, Harold withdrew. He would spend the next four years being trained at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and working as a Russian translator for the Army Security Agency (ASA), an above top secret military branch of the National Security Agency (NSA). Subsequent to his four years with ASA/NSA, Harold returned to college and earned a B.A. in Russian from Penn State, which included advanced studies at the University of Leningrad in the former Soviet Union. His undergraduate program also included further studies in Spanish, German, linguistics, and religious studies (academic theology/social ethics). In addition, during that time and later, Harold continued working as a freelance translator of Russian, Spanish, and German for such agencies as the Defense Intelligence Agency. Following a year of study in social ethics in Penn State’s Graduate School of Religious Studies, Harold worked for two years developing a community relations program for a bank in Philadelphia, Pa. Soon after that, he went on to teach Spanish, English as a Second Language, Russian, and German for the next 26 years at Valley Forge Military Academy and College (VFMAC), a prestigious private boarding school outside of Philadelphia. During his last six years at VFMAC, Harold also served as the academy’s foreign language department chair in addition to his teaching duties at both the middle/high school and college. Throughout that period of his life, he continued to pursue his formal education further; that included two master’s degrees (religious studies/social ethics and Spanish) from Temple University as well as his Pennsylvania K-12 teaching certification in Russian, Spanish, and German from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education.  Harold and his wife, Robin, now live in Orwigsburg, Pa., several miles south of his hometown, Pottsville.  After having traveled most of the world, Harold has returned to the area of his roots. His family has resided in Schuylkill County, Pa. for nearly 200 years, having first arrived via the Underground Railroad.  Presently, Harold continuing preparation for Volumes II and III of “White People: The Great White Hoax,” which is based on 45 years of research and study of American racism.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is interesting to note that the book provides solutions to exercises which will help students when working on their own. The book is well written and recommended for course adoption.\" (Prabhat Kumar Mahanti, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1157, 2009)\"In this book, Parkes attempts to make the material accessible to a much wider and mathematically less sophisticated audience … .

Chronicle reporter Johnny Rose with his first clue that the strange doings afoot in his town may have their origins in the jungles of Southeast Asia. From this moment in Freadhoff's (Codename: Cipher) thriller, the terrors of Vietnam come ever closer. Rose's friend Pham Lich is terrified by the apparition of Kyle Loveless, an American pilot thought to have been killed in Laos but now dining in Lich's restaurant with a bad-news Special Forces captain from the old days. Lich's subsequent murder, the discovery that the captain has been making inquiries about Rose and the identification of the desert body as a POW all put Rose on the trail of a group of veterans trafficking with Asian drug lords. Meanwhile, the reporter is declared a suspect in Lich's murder and runs into trouble on his job when he refuses to accept the position of press secretary for Gordon Geld, the chemicals tycoon and publishing mogul who owns the Chronicle. Harassed by the LAPD and followed by Geld's goons, Rose uses his reporter's skills to connect the mysterious Special Forces captain to a chemical plant owned by Geld in the desert. Sleuthing around Geld's files and slumming in flea-bag hotels, Rose uncovers a dastardly plot motivated by political ambition and achieved through militaristic maneuverings. Though his novel relies on coincidence and plot devices, Freadhoff conjures up enough paranoia to chill readers, all the while offering an insider's take (he's a veteran journalist) on how a good reporter goes about digging out the facts, no matter what the obstacles.

Shell Farm...has been in Caroline's family for generations.... The farmhouse and barn are over a hundred years old and stand as they were built, overlooking the sea. The small 80 acre farm has an orchard and meadows which roll down to a sandy beach. Caroline grew up there, her life ruled by the seasons, tending the land and the livestock. When Caroline weds Amos Wing, he joins her idyllic life on the farm. Their life together begins well, raising livestock and starting a family of four children. When Amos feels pressed financially, he begins a gravel operation to supply the construction boom in nearby towns. He is smitten by opportunity. Over the next 4o years, he literally sells off the land truckload by truckload. The destruction of the Wing family parallels the annihilation of the land. Caroline is overruled in her objections to the gravel operation. She spends the rest of her life as a bitter witness to the disappearance of the familiar features around her. One by one, the children flee the ruined farm. Amos dies alone and unforgiven. It is a hard story. Part two...brings the youngest child, Sarah, now 50, back to the farm from California. She has inherited the remains of the farm and hopes to fulfill her mother's wish that she reclaim it. The story turns upward as Sarah explores her past and assumes her place as custodian of the land, barn and farmhouse as well as Amos Wing's daughter. Clara's sense of place and character are clear and true. The writing is simple and beautiful. She sees the details of the natural world and understands our relationship to them. Her descriptions are vibrant -- I could see the meadows and the blue ocean. I knew I had been there. So many pieces of the story were familiar -- the characters and their actions made sense. I was outraged by Amos' callous betrayal of the land and his family. Yet Clara is kind and generous with her characters, even Amos. Even as I know this is fiction, I still long for someone to restore the land to its original state. I still want to visit. This vivid portrayal of family and their relationship with the land is lovingly and truthfully told. It is a story that will remain with the reader. --Sue Schoen, NEBCA News, Vol.30, Issue 3, Sept 2012Sand and Gravel is a novel of powerful relationships: between husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, even families, and the deep, complex associations land and landscape evoke. An engrossing tale of generations, of trial and redemption, and the strength that a connection to the soil can sustain. Here the environment, the earth Herself, is a character no less than Caroline or Saree, the mother and daughter who form the central focus in this dramatic evocation of life on a failing farm and the consequences that stem from ambition without moral direction, Sand and Gravel is what novels used to, and should, be: an engrossing story as well as thought-provoking. --Bellowing Ark Press, Shoreline, WashingtonSand and Gravel is a novel of powerful relationships: between husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, even families, and the deep, complex associations land and landscape evoke.

On the evening of his funeral my brothers and I\nwere sitting with our mother, reminiscing about our childhoods in Honolulu. As\nwe hadn't been together for many years, we did the usual \"whatever happened to\nso and so\" among the neighbors. My brother Val asked, \"Remember when Mrs.\nGarcia painted her house bright turquoise?\" Nobody else remembered that, but\nsurely a bright turquoise house would have caused a ruckus in our conservative\nIsland neighborhood. \"Why did she do that?\" we asked. He replied, \"She thought the\nmailman wasn't delivering all her mail, and she wanted to make sure he knew\nwhich house was hers.\" Bingo, I though. Dementia. Right there in my mother's\nliving room, with the conversation buzzing around me, the story flew into my\nhead. Of course there were many details to work out over the next four years,\nbut basically that's how it all began.As for the charmingMaurice,I was in Monte Carlo at the casino,\nmesmerized by the very handsome, very French croupier at the roulette table. He\nwas ultra serious, ultra professional, and never so much as glanced at me, not\neven once. As I stood there I thought, now there's the perfect fellow for Laura\nto fall in love with. It can only end badly, which was necessary for the plot.\nI have always been fascinated by how the lives of the very beautiful, both men\nand women, can be different because of their beauty from the lives of ordinary\nmortals. To borrow from F. Scott Fitzgerald and exchange \"rich\" with \"beautiful,\"Let me tell you about\nthe very beautiful. They are different from\nyou and me.\"", "related": ["B00BF0G1WA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Leading experts discuss how the use of high-throughput and computational approaches are generating exciting—and often unexpected—new insights into the microbial-host interactions of a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens, includingSalmonella,Yersinia,Mycobacterium, influenza virus, human and simian immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus. Additional chapters focus on systems approaches to innate immunity, intra- and inter-cellular signaling, biomarker discovery, and the evaluation and rational development of improved vaccines. Systems biology has both been hailed as a paradigm shift that will revolutionize biological science and criticized as overly expensive and complex. While the truth no doubt lies somewhere in between, the approach is yielding increasingly detailed and comprehensive views of biological systems and processes, including those that dictate the host response to infection and disease outcome.Systems Biology of Infectious Diseaseis highly informative reading for investigators already engaged in systems biology research as well as for those scientists and clinicians who may be seeking an introduction to the field.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Waking from a high fever to find herself abandoned to the not-so-tender mercies of taciturn Dr. Hoyt Baxter, however, she discovers she has a full share of Dulan gumption, which she puts to good use in facing down a group of renegade Indians and an equally daunting set of disapproving women at nearby Fort Laramie. Gradually she carves a place for herself in Hoyt's home and his heart, befriends some of the officers' wives, and proves herself by example. Second in the Dulan sisters family saga, Brown's Promised Land romance is a gentle historical set against the unforgiving backdrop of the Old West, providing a poignant view of the hardships suffered by the pioneers and a humorous description of one woman's discovery that even a timid mouse can learn to stand up and roar.Lynne WelchCopyright © American Library Association.

In the Philippines he lives in a bamboo nipa hut near the beach on Malapascua Island whose size is 1 mile wide and 3 miles long. An avid backpacker and adventure seeker, Keith as a youth hiked for weeks and months on end in the California Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. More recently his hikes have included a successful trek into the China Qinling Mountains in search of Wild Giant Pandas. He recently finished the first 800 kilometers of a 1200 kilometer backpack walk across the broadest portion of Northern Thailand.

Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

This short book of vignettes revolves around a stray Skye terrier and the Edinburgh neighborhood that took him in, but it's also an engaging portrait of Scotland in the late 19th century.Greyfriar's Bobby was a real dog, and the One O'Clock gun of the title a real technology, a cannon used to signal the hour and help regulate shipping on the fjord, Firth of Forth. Bobby cadges free meals from area restaurants, but he also follows Colour Sergeant Scott on his errands (including tests of the gun) and occasionally makes himself a minor hero, finding a young girl lost in a crowd, for example, and a survivor in the rubble of a collapsed building. Author George Robinson researched Bobby's story and the history of Edinburgh, and his book, complete with lovely engravings, cries out to be read aloud to children. Passages written in Scottish brogue will be especially fun to sound out. \"I dinnae ken what I would have done if you and Bobby hadnae come along. The theiving scoundrels were trying tae rob me!\"The history is engaging--there's a tragic tenement collapse, an animal rights protest as horse-drawn trams appear in town, and Bobby's legacy and memorial fountain--and while these things are somber, the mood never bogs down. The little dog becomes a sort of community mascot and his charm wins us over as well.Greyfriar's Bobby is a slender volume, but its crisp prose and beautiful art make it a winner.Also available as an ebook.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Did neoliberals possess the power to have wrought such consequences? And if they didn't, who stole the postcommunist states, and why and how did they do so? This is a landmark study of corruption with implications for the whole world.\"—Georgi Derluguian, author ofBourdieu's Secret Admirer in the Caucasus\"This is the best book on the postcommunist state. Almost two decades after 1989, political scientists now know that democracy is not enough. Venelin I. Ganev's erudite and insightful book shows us how difficult it has been to transform the smothering communist state into a competent agent of market regulation and social security.\"—Jeffrey Kopstein, University of Toronto\"In Venelin I. Ganev's reading, the state does not disappear overnight. Rather, it is gradually gutted of its most important functional capacities by members of the state itself or by powerful economic elites with old state connections and knowledge. This development leaves postsocialist society with institutions that are distorted, incapacitated, or both. This exceptionally readable book will enjoy a broad audience among political scientists, sociologists, and political economists interested in transition issues, and also among students in those areas.\"—Mieke Meurs, American University, author ofThe Evolution of Agrarian Institutions\"This is a wonderfully provocative, thoughtful, articulate, and learned book. Venelin I. Ganev's interpretations will appeal to scholars not only of postcommunism but also of the state, informal institutions, and institutional transformation.\"—Anna Grzymala-Busse, University of Michigan, author ofRedeeming the Communist Past\"The work of Venelin Ganev is what area studies should be at its best: rich in local knowledge and theoretically sophisticated enough to make explicit the links between one country and the whole world.\"—Andrew Wachtel, Director of Roberta Buffett Center for Comparative and International Studies and Dean of Graduate School, Northwestern University\"For decades, students of democratization and economic reform have neglected the study of the state. While regimes and markets were in motion-emerging, consolidating, or eroding-state institutions were treated as if they did not change at all. InPreying on the State, Venelin I. Ganev argues convincingly why changes in state institutions have constituted the real drama in post-communist transitions. His book provides the definitive treatment of post-communist politics in Bulgaria, while also making provocative arguments derived from his 'reversed Tillyan perspective' which will resonate with anyone interested in state formation and deformation.\"—Michael McFaul, Stanford University", "related": [], "rank": 2160262, "title": "Preying on the State: The Transformation of Bulgaria after 1989", "author": "Venelin I.

In just a few pages, Everyday Theology will make you both laugh and cry as you remember all of the times you were guilty of offering others a dose of \"common sense.\"Brandon Smith, Director of Gospel-Centered DiscipleshipIn a day and time when quaint sayings and cultural truisms pass for the Word of God, many of us assume that things we've always heard are true actually are. Problem is, many of these sayings are only that--just sayings. What Aaron has done with this short book is help us to see over and over how easily we might assume truth and why we must not. I hope this book will help many recover a greater understanding of the true promises of God found in His Word. Michael Kelley, author of Boring: Finding an Extraordinary God in an Ordinary LifeWe're all theologians, we just don't realize it. And some of the trite Christian statements we repeat reveal beliefs that run counter to the Word of God. Aaron Armstrong deconstructs some of our faulty everyday theology in a graceful, but biblical way. You'll want to get your hands on Everyday Theology and sharpen your theological muscles. Daniel Darling, author of Activist FaithIn a day when much of what we believe goes unchallenged, Aaron Armstrong with grace and truth speaks the Truth in love to us that we might know the Word and love the Son Jesus Christ. I highly recommend you read this book and pray the Lord uses it mightily for His glory.Dave Jenkins, Director, Servants of Grace Ministries", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was almost closing time. He wasn't in\nthe mood to deal with anymore problems tonight. He'd already been here\npreparing dishes since opening this morning. His other chef had called off with\nonly a few moments notice so there was no one he could call.Someone stepped up to\nhis table. If this was another problem, he just might blow his top.Sebastian didn't even\nlook at the person. \"Can I help you?\" he asked, thinking it was one of his\nemployees.\"I certainly hope so.\"Sebastian laid down\nhis pen at the rich, seductive voice. He had to see what the man looked like\nwho spoke in such tones. The man had to be at least six foot two or three and\nsomewhere between one ninety to two hundred pounds, there wasn't an ounce of\nfat anywhere on his well-proportioned body.The man's black slacks\nlooked like they were molded to his body. His white dress shirt was tucked into\nthe waist of his pants and was hanging half-unbuttoned, and the sleeves were\nrolled up to just below his elbows.From what Sebastian\ncould see, the man's skin was dark bronze and flawless, his long coal black\nhair was pulled back in a ponytail. His face was chiseled and so handsome it\nwas almost breathtaking. His brown eyes, so deep and secretive, his full pink\nlips looked soft and very kissable. The man looked and smelled like temptation\nitself. He had seen the man in here before, many times, but never this close.\"Was there a problem\nwith your meal or your service this evening?\" Sebastian questioned.\"No,\" the man shook\nhis head. \"Everything was to my satisfaction. It always is when I eat here.\"\"Was there something\nelse I could do for you?\" Sebastian certainly hoped there was something he\ncould do for this sexy stranger.\"Have you ever been\nwith a Dom?\" the man asked point blank, and Sebastian wondered how the stranger\neven knew he was gay.\"No,\" Sebastian stated\nwith a slight chuckle. \"Do I strike you as a man who wants to be told what to\ndo and when to do it?\"\"I'm not sure what\nsort of man you strike me as being. Maybe it\nwas just wishful thinking on my part. Still I have to ask. Would you ever\nconsider giving it a try?\"\"Are you seriously\nasking me to be your submissive?\" Sebastian asked, his voice sounding almost\ncomical and a little uncertain, nothing like he wanted it to sound.\"If I am?\" the man\nquestioned arching one black brow.\"What makes you think\nI'm into men? I happen to be living with a very beautiful woman.\"\"There's absolutely\nnothing wrong with liking or wanting both. Are you in love with this beautiful\nwoman that you're living with?\"\"I love her,\"\nSebastian said with a nod of his head.\"Would you consider\nmeeting with me and perhaps having a talk over drinks or dinner to get to know\none another?\" the stranger asked.\"Why don't you leave\nme your number and I'll think about it and get back to you.\"Sebastian watched as\nthe man reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card and pen. He scribbled\nsomething on the back of it and then held it out to him. \"My name is Gavin and\nthat's my personal cell number on the back of that card, call me anytime.\"\"I'm Sebastian,\" he\nsaid as he reached out to take the card. His fingers brushed the other man's\nslightly. A spark of electricity went up his arm and through his body.\nSebastian's cock immediately surged to attention, pulsating against the zipper\nof his white chef's pants.\"Don't make me wait\ntoo long, Sebastian.\" Gavin's demand was soft.", "related": ["B00EA8FCI8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gripping, perfectly paced and beautifully written Erin Kelly, author of The Poison Tree A terrifying journey into the possible, this is dystopia for today. Feral, frightening and fascinating, A Lovely Way to Burn gripped and chilled me in equal measure Val McDermid The first in a trilogy, and it should be huge Bookseller I've felt for a while that we are in the mood for an intelligent slice of London-based dystopia, and I think Louise Welsh has cracked it with A Lovely Way to Burn ... it kept me up all night nervously turning the pages Cathy Rentzenbrink, Bookseller Welsh constructs an intelligent mystery within the pages of A Lovely Way to Burn ... It's close enough to what we know to be utterly terrifying and that was part of its hold on me. Welsh has taken our everyday lives, given them a twist, and put them in the background of an intriguing, addictive novel Girlreporter The book isn't out until the 20th March but a mixture of Welsh's writing style and the subject matter made it impossible to resist Crimepieces This is can't put down good Candis You know you're in for a seriously chilling read in this apocalyptic thriller when three very unlikely killers - an MP, a hedge fund manager and a vicar - go on a murderous rampage in the sweltering capital Marie Claire Louise Welsh writes elegantly and has visualised London in extremis with immense and detailed clarity. It is all very exciting, and there are two more volumes to come Literary Review Welsh skilfully presents London, initially as it is now, but rapidly descending into a plague-gripped dystopia ... I appreciate a book that affects me ... the relentlessly taut suspense of A Lovely Way to Burn still lingers on my psyche. Such an apocalyptic crisis does not seem improbable and here's hoping freakishly foul weather and tube trikes are not an omen of things to come Stylist A taut thriller so involving that I missed my bus stop! Woman & Home This is a novel rich in the kind of iridescent word painting that has long been Welsh's speciality, and the vulnerable, often maladroit Stevie is a wonderful protagonist ... readers will be impatient for the second in the trilogy Independent The London of the novel at once recalls sci-fi dystopia, Dante's Inferno and accounts of the 1665 great plague ... Welsh's plot is ably handled ... She has in Stevie ... an engaging, stroppy heroine for the trilogy this novel launches Sunday Times The writer [Louise Welsh] reminds me of most is Ian McEwan: both specialise in secrets, rather chilly sexuality, sudden reversals of fortune, and uneasy intimations of doom ... A Lovely Way to Burn is superb popular fiction - a box-set waiting to happen. Roll on part two Independent on Sunday There are no daughters, no sisters, no mothers in this darkening world; as the city turns to chaos, men roam the streets and women become invisible. This comment on what catastrophe may actually do to society makes Welsh's take on the dystopia less conservative and Wells-like, recalling instead writers such as Doris Lessing or Margaret Atwood. The pace and thriller-style of the narrative pitch her tale towards the commercial end of the market but her lone female in a world dominated by men gives it the subversive edge of a more literary work Scotland on Sunday Welsh weaves thoughtful, emotional themes into a thriller plot - and does it very well ... A Lovely Way to Burn is the first in a promised trilogy, and if Welsh can keep up the quality of writing and create an effective arc, future writers of apocalypse may indeed turn to her to see how it's done Killing Time Crime We've come to expect lots of good things from Welsh, including a brilliant sense of location. She doesn't disappoint with her images of London breaking down. As ever, the writing is fluid, the dynamic taut and through the control of such small telling moments, Welsh deftly breathes life into her characters. Only an accomplished writer knows exactly when to let the reader fill in the gaps. Stevie is a gusty, gripping protagonist, beautifully drawn ... Welsh has taken our everyday lives, given them a twist, and no supernatural manifestation of our darkest hours is any match for what real human beings can do to each other when mankind loses its humanity. This is just first part of a trilogy. Scary, shocking and touching by turns, this apocalyptic thriller will enthral. I haven't been so buried in a book in a while Irish Independent The descriptions of London and society unravelling into chaos are utterly compelling and scarily realistic ... Great if you like tense thrillers - and as it's the first in a series called The Plague Times Trilogy, it bodes well for the next two Heat If you're looking for a novel that communicates thrills and paranoia to the extent that you forget anywhere else you're meant to be until you finish, look no further. I should add a caveat thought: you'll never again listen to a news item about a drug resistant 'super bug' without shivering, and that's even before Book 2 hits the bookshops. So, are you feeling brave? Bookbag Gripping new dystopian thriller ... Welsh has already proven her prowess as a controlling mistress of creepily suspenseful fiction with acclaimed chillers such as The Cutting Room and The Girl on the Stairs. This is an ambitious departure, being the first in a proposed Plague Times trilogy. It succeeds on several counts. It is a propulsive read, written in lean sentences and snappy cliffhanging chapters ... Most impressive of all is the Scottish writer's evocation of a London that, with a Dickensian swagger, emerges as a pulsating untameable beast in its own right Metro A chilling chronicle of an unravelling society and a true testament to an author at the height of her powers. Next instalments can't come soon enough Upcoming4me A brilliantly imaginative thriller with a compelling heroine and well-paced plot that keeps the tension high Hello A Lovely Way To Burn once more proves that there are few writers who can unsettle as Louise Welsh does Scotswhayhae This is the first in a trilogy from the award-winning short-story and thriller writer; a scary vision of London falling apart that's addictively readable Saga Chilling Heat [A] pacy murder mystery ... [Louise Welsh's] plague is plausible and chilling. In a city of desperate people, even the most benign places become fraught with danger, and every step of Stevie's amateur investigation is palpably tense List [Louise] Welsh develops a fantastically written mystery which keeps you hanging on to every word. She creates excelling imagery of the struggle Stevie faces ... A must read, which will leave you dreaming - or having nightmares - of apocalyptic London for weeks Irish Examiner A thrillingly dystopian mystery ... It's a fine setup, and Stevie is a strong character, a forthright blend of sales sass and reporter brass. Welsh is particularly good at describing the institutional and social disorder that accompanies the outbreak of the sweats Guardian Suspenseful and intelligent dystopian fiction. Welsh writes snappily and with filmic precision ... Her setting, vivid and initially familiar, grows increasingly alien as the crisis worsens. Welsh knows exactly how to build tension and momentum as her lone hero presses on with her quest. She also knows how to create a memorably sinister world in which nothing and no one is solid, and the shreds of comfort that remain are intangible or inanimate Sunday Business Post Louise Welsh delivers an absolute cracker of a crime thriller set against the backdrop of a country in the grip of a frightening plague ... Welsh's picture of a rapidly-disintegrating society stands comparison of some of the best in this field, including John Wyndham's timeless classic, The Day of the Triffids, and the fact that A Lovely Way to Burn is the first in a trilogy set in the Plague Times is, for me and other disaster fans, very good news indeed crimereview.co.uk Louise Welsh rarely repeats herself, a quality to celebrate in a crime novelist. A Lovely Way to Burn is a dystopian thriller set in an all-too-plausible version of contemporary London. Welsh puts her own distinctive mark on it ... this intelligent thriller creates an alarmingly convincing picture of London on the brink of disintegration; it reminds us how fragile we are Andrew Taylor, The Spectator Welsh plays brilliantly on our worst fears, and the pace never lets up.

Moose is a painter, writer and tattoo artist presently living and working in the foothills of the North Carolina mountains.

Writing is a lot like painting she says, \"You are making a giant picture using words instead of paint to create the image in the readers mind.\" Margaret has been a lover of science fiction for as long as she can remember. She says one of her favorite memories as a child was watching Star Trek on her grandmother's little black and white TV because the family was watching something else on the TV in the den. To her Star Trek painted a future where everyone, even women, could accomplish anything and the future was not an apocalyptic nightmare but a place where humanity grows into a force for good in the universe. Her Annunaki Song series is loosely based on the ancient legends of the Annunaki race of aliens who modified humanity genetically in the distant past and the human girl who is the culmination of that experiment but it goes so much deeper than that into the future of the human spirit. Science fiction is often so obsessed with technology that the element of the mind, the spirit, is forgotten and Margaret seeks to join the two in a permanent embrace for what is our technology but the embodiment of our imagination.

The sense of sight because it is common generally carries the least amount of weight; followed from least rich to most rich sound, smell, touch, and then taste.Here is a list of each of the five senses.Sight: The most familiar of the senses; so it provides a good framework, a clear way of letting the reader know what is going on and where it is going on. Avoid \"looks angry\" or tacking other abstractions onto the sense of sight.Sound: Carries a way of putting depth and volume into the world. Very difficult to describe in a concrete way, especially music. Rock criticism to me, when it is actually about the music, generally reeks.Smell: Although this is difficult to convey it carries with it rich associations. Part of the difficulty lies in the naming of the smells, which can depend on cultural backgrounds. Avoid \"smell of fear\" or tacking other abstractions onto the sense of smell or tacking onto unscented nouns.Touch: Evocative and implies a close relationship to the environment. Avoid \"feels like crap.\"Taste: Related to smell, can be very powerful and sensual. Avoid the taste in the character's mouth indicating a dramatic state, like, \"He was angry and tasted nickel.\"The other main piece of information that you will need is to understand how to write dialogue in the novel, which is covered in Chapter 6.", "related": ["B00CMMFSPG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Up until now, these spells have only led to the occasional hors d'oeuvre explosion, but Aunt Lilly's goal is to \"straighten out\" Sarah's life, mostly by finding her a true love. Sarah's last relationship, with the sexy and arrogant Anthony, was stormy enough to convince her that love is exactly what she doesn't want or need. When Aunt Lilly and her new friend Emily decide they want to go on a cruise, Sarah is determined to meet Emily's reluctant grandson and convince him to allow them to go. But Sarah soon discovers that the grandson is none other than Anthony, who convinces them all that they should all go on the cruise together, despite Sarah's best efforts to wheedle out of it. Once Sarah and Anthony are thrown together again, sparks fly and old resentments surface--only this time, Aunt Lilly casts spell after spell to complicate things further. Romance author Roblin (Hocus Pocus, 2012) crafts a satisfying, gently comedic love story with just enough eroticism to satisfy readers looking to spice up their literary lives. ...The story's magical elements, and its inclusion of well-meaning, winking-and-nudging old ladies, are welcome departures from typical romantic fare.A fun, relatively unpredictable addition to a well-populated genre. --Kirkus Reviews", "related": ["B00E3LZF9I"], "rank": 1968457, "title": "NOW YOU SEE IT . . .", "author": "Teresa Roblin", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his free time he really enjoys travelling and getting to know different cultures. His favorite way of travelling is a spontaneous, adventurous travelling on a very little budget- something he has been doing since he was a teenager and became a part of his lifestyle. Hitchhiking, as well as using services like ’’couch surfing” are his preferred modes of immersing himself into new cultures and staying out of his comfort zone. He just loves the thrill of unpredictable travelling! Another passion of Ian’s is music. He plays the guitar, sings and composes music. He is also an electronic music producer- something he does as a hobby.  As a child and a teenager, Ian suffered from shyness and low self-esteem. Looking for solutions he would find consolation in doing lots of reading and writing songs. It wasn’t until he began to confront his fears and do exactly the opposite that his brain was telling him.

He writes in various genres, with thrillers, horror and sci-fi to his name, but all of his works are bound by dark suspense. He revels in exploring complex, troubled characters in difficult moral situations, and is a sucker for a plot twist. His work includes the best selling Dead Days serial, the Brian McDone crime mysteries, The Hunger, Killing Freedom, What We Saw, The Watching, She Remembers, Something in the Cellar and Silhouette. Casey lives in the United Kingdom. He has a BA degree in English with Creative Writing from the University of Birmingham, and has been writing stories for as long as he can remember. In his spare time, he enjoys American serial television, is a slave to Pitchfork's Best New Music section, and wastes far too much of his life playing Football Manager games. Ryan is currently working on a new sci-fi horror called Sinkers, as well as the third book in the Brian McDone crime mystery series.
