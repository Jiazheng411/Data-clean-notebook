In retaliation, American President Condoleezza Rice has, through the magic of an unimagined technology, shut down all of Mexico's telephone, fax and Internet communications. That's the fanciful but not entirely implausible futuristic backdrop for this corrosive political satire from Fuentes (The Old Gringo), considered Mexico's leading novelist (and one-time ambassador to France). His darkly comic tale of backbiting, double-crossing, murderous duplicity, sexual scheming and outright assassination is primarily epistolary, and it's a format that suits Fuentes's flowery prose style, though the voices of his various characters tend to blur into one another. Readers with even a smidgeon of familiarity with Mexico's unkempt political traditions will wallow in this caustic indictment.(May 16)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every now and then she had to stand on her tiptoes to get in closer to the mirror. The lighting was bright enough, but she'd made a mess of her eyebrows a time or two, so she tried being more careful. Tweezing hurt, stung, but she didn't like waxing because it was even more painful. Shaving could result in razor bumps, so that hair-shaping method didn't work either.Satisfied that she'd done a great job with her brows, Dakota reached into the glass shower cubicle and turned on the cold water full blast. People thought she was crazy for taking cold showers, but it was her preference. When taking a bath, she used steaming hot water and lots of bubbles and exotic oils. Baths were for relaxing. Showers were meant to invigorate. If she took a hot shower, she'd feel sleepy right afterward.Who wanted to feel that way when starting their day or going out on the town?As the first douse of cold water ran over her ginger-brown flesh, she shivered and danced around a bit. Seconds later, she was all into it. Rarely did she stay in the shower longer than ten minutes at a time. Catching a cold was something she didn't want. Lying in wait for her outside the stall was the thick, white terry-cloth robe she'd slip into right after each bone-chilling experience. The towel warmer kept her fluffy bath sheet heated through and through, creating luxurious sensations against her body.Dakota stepped out of the cubicle and quickly wrapped her body in the towel, glancing down at the dark granite counter where her watch lay. She was eager to check out the time. She had a hot date tonight and she wanted to be ready when Ethan showed up at her door. They'd been dating only a few weeks, seeing each other a few times a week. The couple was still in the getting-to-know-you stage, but she already thought he was a really great guy, gracious and gentlemanly.Ethan Robinson was also drop-dead gorgeous, but Dakota hadn't once gotten the impression he was at all into himself. This fine brother had the darkest, sexiest eyes she'd ever seen, coal-black and piercing. Sometimes she felt like he could see straight through to her soul, although she hoped not.As Dakota stood in front of the mirror once again, fully dried off now, she began to put on her special evening face. Carefully she applied a lightweight foundation and sealant powder and blush to her near-flawless ginger complexion. Streaked with warm bronze highlights, her silky sable hair hung down to her shoulders in thick waves.A very light layer of eyeliner and a bit thicker one of mascara was administered next. Her hazel eyes, large and luminous, often gave away her deepest feelings despite her attempts to keep them hidden, especially from men.Dakota saw a very pretty girl reflected in the mirror, petite in stature, yet well-built. In spite of her short legs, they were full, shapely and smooth as satin, possessing strong, well-defined calves, thanks to her daily twenty-minute workout.Back in her master bedroom, where the decor was also blue and white, with frilly lace and satin, Dakota sat atop the queen, four-poster bed to lotion her legs and feet. She loved to go hoseless in the summer. Even though it was very early fall, she could still get away with bare legs, which had never felt more freedom. She also wore thigh-high stockings, but only on special dress-up occasions. They were comfortable and sexy.Dakota got up from the mattress and smoothed back in place the blue and white lace and satin eyelet comforter, which perfectly complemented the white ProvenÇal furniture. She had been extremely lucky in finding the bedroom set at a thrift shop, unable to believe how reasonably priced it had been. The headboard, dresser, chest of drawers and night-stands were in tiptop shape and didn't have visible marring anywhere. A lovely white desk and hutch completed her bedroom furnishings.Slipping with ease into her slim off-white A-line skirt, she quickly zipped and buttoned the side closure. While pulling over her head a tangerine silk crepe shell, she was careful not to get makeup on it. She planned to take the matching sweater along on the date, as the nights in Los Angeles could turn pretty chilly, especially in the beach areas. Ethan had mentioned Redondo Beach Pier as the dining venue.The doorbell rang at the same time she slid her feet into tangerine patent leather pumps. She loved bright, flashy colors, which was evident in her limited but adequate wardrobe. There wasn't a lot of money in her budget to spend on clothes. Dakota loved to browse the consignment shops in upper-crust neighborhoods. It was like going on a treasure hunt. More often than not, she walked away with some pretty fabulous, excellent quality merchandise—and for very little money.Grabbing her sweater off the bed, she ran for the door of her two-bedroom apartment. Dakota's heart rate instantly picked up speed. Ethan. His gentle touch did crazy things to her, producing alien yet pleasurable sensations.As Dakota reached her compact living room, she looked around to see that everything was in place. The only furniture she owned for the living room was a nice sofa and matching chairs, done in a variety of earth tones. They, too, had come from secondhand establishments she frequented. The coffee and end tables, carved out of mahogany hardwoods, were newer than everything else. She had purchased them with her last income-tax check at a going-out-of-business sale, which meant she hadn't had to pay an arm and a leg to take ownership. The off-white and creamy beige area rug brightened the entire room. A couple of African-American works of art graced the ecru walls.The bell pealed again before Dakota got there. She was so nervous. Her palms already felt sweaty. After peering into the small security window, she finally swung back the door wide, pulling off a beautiful, brilliant smile. \"Hey, you, come on in.\"Twenty-nine-year-old Ethan Robinson, tall and sexy, stepped inside. Dressed in beige Dockers and a deep lavender silk shirt, open at the collar, he looked delicious. As soon as his dark eyes connected with hers, he bent his head and landed a light kiss on her full mouth. His head was covered with loose golden-brown curls, which complemented his bronze, smooth complexion. He also had a dark mole just above the corner of his mouth, on the right side. She loved how it added to his sex appeal.Smiling softly, he smoothed back an unruly strand of hair from her oval-shaped face. \"I was thinking about you all day.\" His smile was broad and electric, nearly causing her knees to buckle. Ethan had straight white teeth and was proud to show them off.He reached down and took her hand. \"Are we ready?\"She nodded. \"Got everything I need.\"Removing the key ring from her hand, Ethan secured the apartment door.As the couple began the short walk to his car, he gently dropped his arm around her shoulders. \"Thereareadvantages to living on the first floor of a three-story complex, especially when the elevator doesn't work. I always get my favorite spot right outside every time I've come over.\"\"Youhavebeen lucky. Tenants are assigned covered parking spots in well-lit areas nearby. I used to park in a visitors' slot until management caught on. I was reprimanded, of course.\"Ethan placed a light kiss on Dakota's forehead. Just that slight touch set off a firestorm below his waistline. He fought hard to keep his manhood from responding, but he had been on fire for Dakota from day one. \"Let's get a move on then.\"Getting into the car wasn't a surefire way for Ethan to keep his visible desire in check, but it might help to hide it. Dakota wasn't ready for anything more than the few kisses and hugs they'd shared—and he wasn't the kind of man who'd press her. Any physical connection of the intimate kind had to come by mutual agreement. He found her exciting and refreshing, a far cry from some of the women he'd run into.Learning that twenty-four-year-old Dakota was studying to become a teacher was a good feeling for him. She had said she'd gotten a late start on her educational goals, but she hadn't told him the reason. Once she received her B.S. and teaching certification, she planned a career in special education. He had a good friend who was in the same field. There were never enough educators and special-education teachers were badly needed.Dakota smiled every time she saw the silver convertible. Equipped with a mesh wind protector, the top was already down. She didn't have to worry about her hair. She had a natural wave pattern and there wasn't much that could destroy it.\"Your car looks like it was recently washed and waxed, but I can't recall seeing it any other way. I guess if I had this nice of a ride I'd keep it spotless, too.\"Opening the door for Dakota to get in, Ethan chuckled. \"After our first date, I was sure I had bored you to tears by telling you how much I loved my brand-new car. Once I got home, I realized I'd acted like a stupid teenager with his first set of wheels.\"\"Youdidtalk about it a lot, but you weren't boring. Your enthusiasm was contagious and so were you. Cute, too.\"\"Cute, huh?\" he mocked her, slipping into the driver's seat. He instantly started the engine and backed out carefully.Dakota was comfortable on the plush ash-gray leather seat and her mind instantly reverted back to when and where they'd first met. It was one of her fondest memories. She touched his arm gently. \"Do you remember our first meeting?\"\"I'd never forget it. A few weeks have passed, but it's still fresh in my mind. The library near your junior college campus happens to be in my Torrance neighborhood.\"\"You mean your upper-crust hood, don't you?\"\"That's howyousee it.

Chaucer's era, which encompassed the Hundred Years War, the Black Death, the Peasants' Revolt, John Wycliffe's proto-Protestantism and the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, is not without interest. Finding Chaucer often on the periphery of these events, West is left to argue that it was a pivotal era for England, in transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and between a French-dominated culture and a homegrown national identity. As for his treatment of Chaucer, about whom little is known, West relies on a discussion of translation of the French medieval bestseller Le Roman de la Rose to Canterbury Tales. Despite the chronological remoteness of the era, West colors in his subject matter with contemporary parallels, sometimes stretching the point, such as comparing the plot of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde to that of Casablanca. More often than not, in West's presentation Chaucer was neither as forward-looking nor as reactionary as some other biographers, such as Terry Jones or G. K. Chesterton, would have itAhe was simply a man of his time. Students of literature looking for a historical context in which to put Chaucer will find edification here, but the man still remains at a distance. 8 pages b&w; photos not seen by PW.

His divorced parents are preoccupied-Mom is happily smoking pot with her new husband and Dad is having an affair with his secretary-and they pay little attention to Hank. Only his stepmother, \"Perfect-Lady-Karen,\" seems to notice him, and her attentions lead to preachy Bible sermons and little else. Hank spends much of his time near the Gunpowder River, where he meets two older men who invite him to join their paintball team. He enjoys this diversion, and agrees to join them for a weekend camp-out tournament. On the excursion, Hank finds out that the two men are gay; unfortunately, so do their Christian homosexual-hating campmates, who chase them and kidnap Hank. The boy escapes, and is rescued by his English teacher, who is coincidentally driving home from a summer retreat. Hank's voice is fresh and believable; Montgomery's writing combines vernacular language, metaphor, and simile to present the colorful life of a young man discovering the world. There are plenty of teenage-boy details, such as Hank's fascination with breasts and descriptive sex scenes; interspersed are heavy-handed messages about acceptance and Christ.

He takes a hard look at the stereotypes and racism of his childhood and Australia as a whole and his own misconceptions of Native Australian culture and traditions. What follows is his account of first figuring out how and where to return it, and then the bureaucracy involved, the government's horrifying lack of respect for these people, and the appreciation and ceremony on the part of the Native people when it was returned. This memoir strikes the perfect balance between being informative and giving extraordinary insight into Aboriginal culture.

Aged six, he was sent to England to be educated, firstly in Southsea, where he was cared for in a foster home, and later at Westward Ho, a United Services College in Devon. A life of misery at the former was described in his story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', whilst Westward Ho was used as a basis for his questioning the public school ethic in 'Stalky and Co'. Kipling returned to India in 1882 to work as an assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore. His reputation as a writer was established with stories of English life in India, published there in 1888/9. 'The Phantom Rickshaw', 'Soldiers Three' and 'Under the Deodars' are amongst these early works. Returning to England in 1889, Kipling settled in London and continued to earn a living as a writer. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, an American. They travelled extensively in the following four years, including a spell living in America, and it was in this time most of his enduring work was written, not least 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Second Jungle Book'. Kipling once again returned to England in 1896 and continued his writing career, although tragedy hit the family when his eldest daughter, Josephine, died in 1899. Nonetheless, in 1901 he completed 'Kim', often considered to be his best work. The following year, having settled in Sussex, he published 'Just So Stories', a book he had planned to write for Josephine. Having refused the position of Poet Laureate, which was offered in 1895, he did accept the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first English author to be so honoured. By 1910, however, Kipling's appeal was waning. His poems and stories were based on values that were perceived as outdated. There was widespread reaction against Victorian imperialism, highlighted by the incompetent management of the Boer War. When World War I came, Kipling had difficulty in adapting to the mood of the public and after his only son, John, was reported missing in action believed killed in 1915, he became very active on the War Graves Commission.  After the war he became an increasingly isolated figure, although some of his best writing was to come, with 'Debits and Credits' in 1926 and 'Limits and Renewals' in 1932. Kipling died in 1936 in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Today, however, he is once again avidly read not just for the quality of his writing and storytelling, but through a renewed", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is liberally interspersed with pen and ink drawings by co-author/artist Carol Sletten.Story of the American West employs scientific journals and studies, histories, newspapers, dissertations, diaries and Mormon stake histories to give a nitty-gritty peek at lost children, epidemics, supply trails, battles over religious beliefs, political leanings, and racial and cultural backgrounds. A big part of the book zeroes in on the Indian culture and the problems that developed when the white man arrived. Also included are stories and the background of the wars between cattlemen and sheepherders, loggers and settlers, pioneers and ranchmen, and the U.S. forest service against them all.Kit Carson first came to the area at age 19. Tom Horn spent many years there, both as an interpreter and leader of the Apache Scouts against Geronimo and others. In 1870 Camp Ord, which eventually became Fort Apache, was established. This brought a large number of notable people to Arizona including Doctor Walter Reed and General George Crook. For WWHA members the numerous sections on the Outlaw Trail from Canada through the northeast portion of Arizona and down in to Mexico will be especially exciting. Some of the well-known outlaws who spent time here were Butch Cassidy, Ike Clanton and Black Jack Ketchum.The Pleasant Valley War spread to the area with Sheriff Commodore Perry Owens playing a significant part. The hanging of three local men led to the story behind The Ox-Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark and the movie of the same name. Zane Grey is known to have spent a lot of time traveling through the White Mountains to gather stories. To the Last Man was based on his research on the Pleasant Valley War and The Hash Knife Outfit was based on the troublesome cowboys of the Aztec Land and Cattle Company. Other interesting side stories include Edward F. Beale and his camel experiment in 1857, the Apache Kid, and the importance of the Buffalo Soldiers.The only disappointment is the lack of footnotes, something historians find a necessity. Although I realize this isn t what the authors were doing and I enjoyed the reading, my researcher self often wanted more details and specific sources.There is a good index and bibliography in the book along with extended versions at the Web site storyoftheamericanwest.com, where sample chapters are also available.Carol Sletten and Eric Kramer have pulled together an enticing story of the Old West with a diverse subject range that will interest all who enjoy reading about the people and events of the American West. --Wild West History Association", "related": ["B006G3L220"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Amelia Drake learns that her father is dead, she initially rejects her mother's idea to use the family lumber mill as her dowry. Instead, Amelia plans on accepting Kyle's offer to buy her father's mill as a way of providing for her mother, leaving Amelia to a life of dull respectability as a schoolteacher. All of Amelia's plans change, however, when she and Kyle are caught in a compromising situation. She impulsively forces him into proposing, trapping them in a marriage neither one wants but both truly need. Kyle, whose fiancee left him to marry his brother in Lindstrom's superb first romance,Shades of Honor[BKL Jl 02], is determined not to open himself up again to emotional pain and betrayal, but with the help of lonely, stubborn Amelia, he regains his sense of trust and learns to love again, in this deeply emotional, quietly captivating historical romance.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

Sharman is a sweet love story in the middle of a suspense novel. All the elements of a good suspense story are here, someone wants to kill or harm Gypsy, someone is stirring up trouble for the McCasseys, and there is drama and action galore. But despite the suspense, the romance between Rebel and in fact his whole family and Gypsy is so sweet. Gypsy doesn't just fall in love with Rebel but with his entire family and the feeling is mutual. It is easy to fall in love with this gentle, misjudged giant and his family and Gypsy in spite of all she?s experience is a loving, yet spunky, soul. The fact that this book is just the first in a trilogy makes it all the more special. I can't wait to read the next installment and watch as the McCasseys grow and evolve into the wonderful loving people they are meant to be. It will be an interesting 'ride' to see how Ms. Sharman manages to turn these rough men around and make them fit for society and to see just what kind of women will love them!5 Angels!\"- Stephanie B.,Fallen Angel Reviews\"No Worriesis an amazing example of romantic suspense done right. Lauren Sharman has a home run with this novel. Everything works and there is no slack in the writing. This is one of those books that had me reading from start to finish in one sitting.\"--Kimberley Spinney,Ecataromance\"No Worriesis a gripping story from beginning to end. Readers will thoroughly enjoy the wonderful characterizations of regular folks who may be poor in terms of wealth, but who are rich in family and loyalty. Readers . . . are likely to find themselves sucked into the story so thoroughly that not much else will get their attention.

With deft prose and page after page of keen insights, Heffernan shows why we close our eyes to facts that threaten our families, our livelihood, and our self-image -- and, even better, she points the way out of the darkness' Daniel H. Pink, author of DRIVE and A WHOLE NEW MIND 'A thoughtful and entertaining treatise on the seductiveness--and  consequences--of ignoring what's right in front of our eyes, from former CEO and author Heffernan (The Naked Truth). We frequently ignore painful or frightening truths, subconsciously believing that denial can protect us, she argues, but our delusions make us ever more vulnerable, and whatever suffering we choose to ignore continues unabated. The author draws examples from the private--Bernie Madoff's family's blindness to his Ponzi scheme; a woman who married an alcoholic; another unable to see that her husband is sexually abusing her daughter--to the public: Alan Greenspan ignoring the housing bubble, a soldier working for Hitler. She gives us an insightful look into the psychology of denial and makes an ethical and pragmatic argument for engagement rather than deflection. Heffernan's cogent, riveting look at how we behave at our worst encourages us to strive for our best' US Publishers'  Weekly 'We can all be guilty of denying the truth and reluctance to acknowledge uncomfortable facts is all around but just what makes us so inclined to wilful blindness? Heffernan addresses this using psychological studies and interviews and applies her theory to explain why incidents such as the financial crisis occur'  Daily Express 25/2  'Writing in clear, flowing prose, (Heffernan) draws on psychological and neurological studies and interviews with executives, whistleblowers and white-collar criminals...the book made me think long and hard about how the pace and priorities of our daily lives can hinder our ability to live as decently and as truthfully as we can'  Nancy F. Koehn, New York Times April 2011 'Willful Blindness is a remarkable book...It is a tour de force of brilliant insights, broad span applications and written in the most engaging style.'

Rosie is happy with her adoptive parents, Auntie Maggie and Uncle Bert, at their quiet cafe in Soho, surrounded by a lively cast of adoring adults. But dark clouds soon begin to gather. An old wartime crony of Uncle Bert's, an ex-GI known as the Widow Ginger, is nosing around in menacing fashion, and Uncle Bert is now at odds with longtime pal Maltese Joe. Though she doesn't fully understand why, Rosie knows it's not good for Uncle Bert and Maltese Joe to be on the outs, and everyone is nervous about the presence of the Widow Ginger. Threatening incidents occur, and even Rosie can feel the tension. Despite the muted suspense, readers will warm to this unsentimental portrait of postwar London and the eccentrically lovable denizens of Rosie's Soho.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Around closing time, Harris escorted a bartender to her car. While watching her drive off, a man in the parking lot threw an unprovoked punch at him. Harris wrapped the man in a bear hug and wrestled him to the ground. The man, a 30-year-old Nigerian immigrant, died within minutes. Deeply distraught over the man’s death, Harris’s agony was just beginning. The overly zealous District Attorney of Fort Bend County, Texas, seized on the case—publicizing it and prosecuting it with the full force of his office--in an attempt to win his upcoming bid for re-election. This Kindle Single tells the story of a man caught between a bungled police investigation and a zealous District Attorney. Paul Alexander’s writing is suspenseful and wonderfully visual as he guides readers deftly through the initial altercation, the police investigation, the autopsy, cause-of-death speculation, legal wrangling, and the stunning courtroom trial. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": 658513, "title": "Accused (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Paul Alexander", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.125, "rating_total": 33.0}

From razor blades and glue to the abstract world of cyberspace. Even though I was there through much of the transition from film editing to non-linear I did not see the scale of dreamers around me looking for ways to digitize the process beyond meager budgets in a competitive market place. Buck brings to life this vibrant historical look at the evolution of post production.Editing veteran Stuart Bass, has cut the TV programs \"MacGyver\", \"The Wonder Years\", \"Arrested Development\" and \"The Office\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In that day and age when he was a kid they just made noise and didn’t fire projectiles or anything.  William Frisbee recalls staying out late at night with a bunch of friends, worried more about getting spotted and ‘killed’ than about rattlesnakes, water moccasins or big rabid elephant eating spiders back in the 70’s.  In retrospect, it is a surprise he survived his early years.  Since the earliest age, he had planned on joining the Army; his mother was Army, uncles and cousins Army.  So naturally, when it came time, he joined the US Marines and he has never come to regret that decision.  He wanted to be infantry and that is exactly what he was. William Frisbee started playing paintball in 1989 after having been in the Marines for a year. Being a big tough Marine (and also a boot), with quality combat training, it was a humbling experience to say the least. He was barely able to hold his own against two civilians who knew the field and weapons much better than he did and the first casualty was arrogance.  He has been playing off and on ever since.  William started playing ‘airsoft’ in 1990 with gas powered MP5’s in the barracks (the FPS was like 3).  When he got out of the Marines in 1992, he was a Corporal and the last billet held was infantry Squad Leader.  A veteran of Desert Storm, he came in #2 in the Hawaii Infantry Squad Leader school (about 40 other NCO’s), and 2nd in Terrorist Counteraction in Okinawa.  During his time with 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines he was a SAW Gunner on Competition Squad, an elite squad taken from the best volunteers of a company that competed at the Battalion, Regimental and then Division level.  The squad came in 2nd place at the Division competition in Okinawa.  William has always had an interest in small unit tactics and infantry techniques and it has continued to this day. These days he can be found playing airsoft, going to the gym, writing, reading, spending time with his family or tinkering with computers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mr. Dark is also, perhaps, the only one who knows the reasons behind his Matt's resurrection from the dead. But Mr. Dark is much more than that. But what, exactly? That's the question that every author is tackling and each one is coming up with their own, intriguing interpretation.Lee and Bill have been enormously generous letting the writers contribute to the development of the Dark Man's nature. And it's interesting, because--like Matt's character--the Dark Man is an archetype that's incredibly versatile. A blogger recently implied that Lee and Bill may have borrowed the evil-clown idea from Todd McFarlane'sSpawnseries.But this is nonsense. The wicked, unpredictable trickster is one of the oldest characters in fiction. McFarlane's Violator was begat by Stephen King's Pennywise who was begat by Jerry Robinson's The Joker, who was begat by Edgar Allen Poe's Hop-Toad, who was begat by Mr. Punch, who was begat by Shakespeare's Fool, who was begat by Malory's Merlin, who was begat by the Loki, who was begat by Raven (Europe), Coyote (America), and Spider (Africa). They are all manifestations of the same principle.What is that principle? Every writer of the Dead Man will come to his or her own conclusions.For myself, that principle is entropy, and the madness and despair that arise from our recognition that all our efforts will ultimately end in death. The major challenge of life is to withstand--and maybe even overcome--that terrible prospect. In the Welsh Grail legendPeredur, the hero is frequently tormented by a black hag who reminds him at every turn that all his acts of valor are causing more harm than good. That hag, portrayed eight hundred years ago, is the direct ancestor of Mr. Dark. And you don't have to be a medieval knight errant to know who she is. I've seen her. And I bet you have, too.How we deal with her terrible message is the biggest challenge that we face in life. And one of the ways we learn to deal with it is by reading about others who confront it head-on. Matt Cahill is a hero because he does just that. That's why it's a thrill to read about him. That's why, when we read about him beating the devil, we set down the book hopeful and happy, believing--for a time-–that we can, too.", "related": ["B00GHOI0NM"], "rank": 925734, "title": "The Beast Within (Dead Man Book 7)", "author": "James Daniels", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.625, "rating_total": 29.0}

Aus eigenem Erleben kennt er die Tricks der Waffenhändler, der Treuhänder in Zürich und die der Banken. Die Methoden der Schlapphüte des KGB und der westlichen Gegenspieler hat er schmerzhaft am eigenen Leib erlebt. Er sagt - ich schreibe aus meinem Kopf ab. Und wenn das nicht reicht, nehme ich die Köpfe meiner Freunde hinzu. Geboren 1942 in Landsberg/Warthe, aufgewachsen in Güstrow, Krefeld und auf vielen Stationen dazwischen. Ausbildung - etwas liederlich, größtenteils auf Reisen, weniger auf Schulen. Reisen nehmen einen großen Teil seines Lebens ein, besonders die Jahre bei der Handelsmarine. Diese Phase beeinflusst ganz wesentlich sein Schreiben. Detlev Crusius hat gelebt und gearbeitet in Krefeld, Köln, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Rom, London, Moskau, Riad, Jeddah, Tripolis, Damaskus und Zürich. Zu seiner Biografie gehören auch vier Jahre Gefängnis, wegen Verstoß gegen das Außenwirtschaftsgesetz und das UN-Embargo gegen Libyen.

There is a recently adopted an abandoned burro, renamed “Homer”.  Should see him in action protecting the \"tribe\" (a herd of goats), going so far as to stand over newborn kids until they could be brought up to the safety of the barn. There are cats inside and out.  Inside there's a darling little Shih Tzu mix; two cats (one HAS to be part dog).  Outside a couple of roaming pet roosters in the yard and various wild animals wandering through on occasion complete the menagerie.  Susan adds to those chores by working full time as an executive assistant to President of a company in “The City”.  So basically, she types all day just to come home and type some more.

Here the familiar figure of the honest cop plays his role in the unfamiliar milieu of Teheran's fundamentalist Islamic society, as he becomes a threat to the government itself. Conducting a routine murder investigation to solve the death of a sexually mutilated young woman, chief homicide detective Darius Bakhtiar discovers the existence of a state-sponsored terrorist group, the Brides of Blood. This secret sorority of virgins, fanatical in their religious devotion, are trained to martyr themselves in terrorist aggression. After Bakhtiar uncovers evidence of sanctioned efforts to arm Iran with biological weapons, he and Maryam Lejavardi, the beautiful former Bride he has begun to protect and love, are tortured in Iran's feared Evin prison. The unimaginable horrors of Iran's torture factory might have overwhelmed a lesser novelist, but Koenig artfully blends assiduous research and superbly maintained suspense as he builds to the thrilling, unrelenting--and very cinematic--final pages. This is a sophisticated evocation of another society and culture; an exotic background made palpably sinister through proven thriller techniques.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was the size of a small manor house. When she opened the great oak doors, Dari gasped in astonishment. It was very Tudor. Her heart skipped several beats as she took in the oak paneled walls, the wide oak staircase, and the impressive stone archways.\"Very little has been done to the Dower House over the centuries, most of the renovations and improvements have been done to the main house,\" Susie remarked.\"You can almostfeelthe history here,\" Dari said in awe, as they moved quickly into wide entrance hall and stood looking up at the portrait of Henry. \"But, it doesn't look like him!\" she exclaimed, scrutinizing the portrait closely. \"At least, not like any of the other portraits I have seen of him.\" Henry stood, resplendently garbed in Tudor dress, with his horse in the background and two large English Mastiffs at his feet. His hair vibrant red, his smile almost mischievous, glowing with health and vitality, not a single extra pound adorned his lean frame.\"I know,it's really quite unique! We aren't sure who painted it, in fact the story goes, that, each of the earls through the centuries has added a little touch of their own. One of our ancestors was particularly fond of dogs, we think he may have added the Mastiffs, or at least repainted them if they were in the original. Mastiffs are known as 'The dogs of kings.' It's Pailing's favorite painting of course, as she's such a dog lover!\"\"It's Henry as he would have been in the prime of his life, at his most athletic isn't it?\" Dari asked. \"It fits all the descriptions I have read of him.\"\"Yes,\" Susie said. \"There are some early portraits of him, but this one can't be verified. It could just be the figment of the artist's active imagination, a romanticized version of young Henry as they envisioned him to be, perhaps in his twenties. It's not signed.\"\"The eyes are the same,\" Dari said, sitting down on the nearby wooden settle and taking her time scrutinizing the painting. \"The ring is the same.\"\"Yes, unfortunately that is one of the things that leads everyone to assume it is a fake. The ring is the same as the one in the portrait in the long gallery, but it has never surfaced in any other portraits but the ones in this house. No one knows if it ever existed, since during the Interregnum, the crown jewels were taken by Cromwell, the gems sold and the gold melted down for coin. My ancestor Lady Elizabeth Darfield is seen to be wearing it too.\" She pointed to the portrait next to Henry. \"It may be merely the artist's way of leaving his unique signature on a portrait.\"Dari stood enthralled. She could just stand here all day and scrutinize the pictures. \"Lady Elizabeth is beautiful,\" she said softly.\"Yes, she is,\" Susie agreed. \"Come on, I'll show you the rest of the house, wait till you see the bed!\"Dari's jaw dropped when she walked into the room housing the giant Tudor bed. Carved from solid oak, it was a stunning masterpiece of carpentry. \"It was built here, in this room. It's too big to get through the doors, so we can't move it to the main house without damaging it,\" Susie said ruefully. Carved Tudor roses adorned the headboard and all four posts. \"We call this 'The Henry Room'.\"\"It is truly amazing!\" Dari breathed.\"We think so too.\"Dari was silent for a moment then, \"I love it here!\" she blurted out unexpectedly, surprising both herself and Susie.\"I'm glad Dari,\" Susie said gently. \"No matter what happens with you and Adam, I'll always be glad you came. You've brought him back out of himself; he's had so many responsibilities and worries in the past year. He's been walking through life like an automaton since dad died.\"\"Am I seeing the real Adam now then Susie? Or is hestilljust a little subdued?\"Susie almost choked on a laugh. The real Adam or theRandy Earlas Pailing liked to call him, wellthatshe hadn't seen...yet! Though if what she had walked in on the other day was any indication of how things were going with the two of them, it wouldn't be long. \"Not yet Dari, but I have a feeling you will soon.\"\"Will what?\" asked Adam, entering the room.", "related": ["B0082JA196"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

Lee was born in Massachusetts, United States.  He has developed enormous passion in reading, writing, drawing and learning music since he was five.  His interests in reading include history, biographies, fictions and encyclopedias. In the August of 2011, David published this first book Danny and the Portal of the World through Createspace.  He was a seven year old second grade student when he authored and illustrated the book.  He received great feedback from book authors, school principals and library staffs. His book is on sale in both paperback and Kindle versions on Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. Several public libraries in Massachusetts also carry his book for circulation. Currently, David maintains his author blog “Books R Fun” (located at http://booksrfun.infomages.com/) to inspire young children to read and write more often.  All 12 chapters of Danny and the Portal of the World are on TTS (Text-to-Speech) and MP3 formats for public sharing.  They can be downloaded for free through his blog or YouTube. As a young author, he was invited to demonstrate his book writing process to local communities during the Geek the Library and Literacy Night events. In the May of 2012, David sent President Barack Obama a signed copy of his first book Danny and the Portal of the World as a gift.  A month later, he received an appreciation note from the White House signed by the President.  The note was a surprise to David and his response was, “It means a lot to me.” In the June of 2012, David finished composing his 1st piano music “The Nature Symphony” and performed the piece in front of the audience during his first annual recital. Danny and the Trip to Outer Space is his second book and is the sequel of Danny and the Portal of the World. Currently, David is working on his 3rd book, Danny and the Invasion of the Dinosaurs.

I don't think anyone should have to work for less than US minimum wage, and I knew that many Turkers were doing just that.This book also came about because I discovered the hard way that many beginning transcribers, not just those on Mechanical Turk, lack any major source of help in building their transcription skills. I know, because when I was trying to learn the work myself, I looked everywhere. That included buying the other transcription ebooks you'll see on Amazon.What that taught me was that most every easily available resource, including those other books, breezes right over the skill-building part. Don't get me wrong: some of them have great advice on resume building and managing your own business and setting up an ergonomic workspace. Some even have very useful lists of transcription companies outside of Mechanical Turk that you can apply for work with, later on.But none of them give much in the way of real help with learning the actual skills of transcription. Yet that's what newbies often need most. Let's face it: until you feel confident doing the work itself, you don't care that much whether you've got your chair exactly the right height!That's why this book is full of practical ideas for approaching the actual transcription tasks. And because beginning transcribers, especially on Turk, may not make much money when just starting out, I wanted this book to be priced very low, so that most could afford it, no matter what.When I was doing all my weeks of research and figuring out how best to break all that knowledge down in writing, I meant for this book to help those who are brand-new to transcription gain confidence and skill. I never expected that I would be hearing from even experienced transcribers, some of whom have told me that the book has taught them a few new things!

Brian Rawson was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, but moved to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where he attended Eastern Military Academy in Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island. After the Vietnam War draft was canceled, Rawson turned to journeymen work. In 1976, however, his life took a strange twist. His father worked as a film editor for Columbia Pictures in New York City. One day as Rawson was visiting his father, a feature film assistant director and producer, Lou Stroller, came into the office. When he found out Rawson was unemployed, Stroller offered him a job on the motion picture Eyes of Laura Mars, to become a production assistant and personal assistant to Faye Dunaway. From that day on, for the next fifteen years, Rawson worked his way up the production ladder to assistant director on numerous feature films, including such hits as the first two Crocodile Dundee films and the television show Tales From the Darkside. It was from this background that Rawson developed the idea for Secrets of a Universe. When production issues in the early 1990s threatened a film work stoppage, Rawson packed up and left New York City with his wife, Colleen, and moved to Brownsville, Pennsylvania, her home town. Life was good until 2000, when catastrophe struck. Rawson was afflicted with Hodgkin’s Disease, and after a year of chemo and radiation, he was pronounced in remission. But, in 2001, he was again knocked off his feet by the first of seven heart attacks. Over the next eleven years, Rawson survived everything that goes with severe cardiac disease. Now permanently disabled, Rawson decided to complete all the stories stored in his head that he wanted to do on film in novel form.  Secrets of a Universe is the first of many, so buckle your seat belts. The strange mind of H. Brian Rawson is only now opening up.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The first\npart is full of witty rhymes that introduce each of the animals that\nmight be found on a farm and some of their characteristics. It is a\nwonderful way to teach children about farm animals. The second part\nstirs the imagination by asking silly questions all based around one\nsingle concept of what the child would do if certain animals were given\nto them as a gift. The third part is a short tale about the different\nways to eat and enjoy carrots, rhyming all of the way along, of course.\nThe book continues on with rhymes about elephants, puppies, shoes, and\neven echidnas, who aren't kidding. It is wrapped up with a sweet rhyme\nabout dreaming.All in all, Small Folk Rhymes is a very creative set of rhymes that help\n draw out a child's imagination. The graphic work is simple and\neffective and the rhymes are easily understood. Christine has an awesome\n talent for making things sound ridiculous yet funny and simple yet\nprofound. To teach even the most basic concepts, there is often a\nstruggle for the teacher to come up with a new and exciting way to\ncapture the full attention of children. This book is able to do just\nthat and go beyond the simple concepts to open up the doors of\nexploration. Anyone serious about encouraging children to read, should\nhave a bookshelf full of her books.", "related": [], "rank": 4538377, "title": "Small Folk Rhymes", "author": "Christine Larsen", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For such individuals, suicide is often considered a viable option to the pain of living a life outside their control.  We, as a caring community, can help those living such painful lives with information and guidance....if we know how!  This has been the second reason for writing on this topic.    The information for this book has come from over 35 years of personal and professional work as a Counsellor, Mentor and Coach.  In this role, our team has come across many people we could help.  Many gained a greater understanding of their issues and learned better coping skills.  As such, their lives reflected a change in thinking and behaviour for the better.     Applying a spiritual element for many caught in such spirals, was the solution thers needed to also apply.  Learning to see themselves as worthy and of value to their Creator brought the hope to walk their healing journey.  Have you found that for yourself or could you lead another into that spiritual health for their own good?     What place does community centres, church groups and youth activities have in helping those struggling around us?  These groups do have a part to play in helping prevent such traumas but how?    Mental illness is not always the push that sends someone toward suicide.  Again, seeing signs of those caught in the web of mental illness might be the helping hand they need to climb out of despair.  So who are the highest risk groups?  Have suicide figures gone down with the pressures of being a teen in our society today?  This has been another reason to share this book with you!     As has been said: \"Suicide is apermanentresult to an often temporarysituation\".  However, for others the pressures of their life seemed to continued on this downward spiral.  Knowing the signs  and helping interventions could guide many people.  You will find these questions  covered in our book.     We cannot prevent a suicide as someone who has set their course in that direction will find a way to accomplish their plan.  This is one reason why we have addressed the topic as 'Suicide Intervention'.  Practing the revelant techniques can help save a life headed toward self destruction.  Again, we as a community need to know some of these answers as found in this book.    In our Case study, Sonja had the view that life was so terrible, suicide was her only alternative.  Sadly, those left behind struggled with an uncertain world, learning to come to grips with grief and questions.  Anyone who walks into a suicide event will have similar questions.  This has been another purpose for writing 'At the Time of her Death: Suicide Intervention'.  There are answers to help comfort those left behind when they walk their own 'Valley of Grief'.    Knowing the signs of healthy grief and the signs of those stuck in grief helped the people involved in Sonja's death.  Our culture needs to allow such a journey but everyone faces their loss in different ways.  Linda, in our case study, did come through in her questioning, searching for answers; others do not and are stuck in their loss.  This area has also been added to our book to help observant people see this path back to health.    Then the issues of a violent and unresolved grief that come from some forms of suicide have also been addressed.  These cases need special care and understanding for the many layers of questions seem overwhelming.  How do you help children comes to terms with such deaths?  Where do the issues of bullying and teasing cause harmful influences on those considering suicide?    So who needs to read this book?  This book is a very valuable tool for those who work in the 'People Helping' careers and professions.  This includes teachers, nurses, doctors, aged-care givers, chaplains to list a few.  I also recommend it to those who want to expand their knowledge about the topic because they live in a real world where suicide does happen.  Those who havejourneyed through the painful experience will benefit also.  Having a 'benchmark' of their success or issues to still work through will bring more health.     We have also included many Personal Worksheets for those facing the grief and loss through suicide, whether in an 'Assisted Suicide',  a planned escape from life or even an attempt at suicide.  Understanding more about 'Self-Care' for those involved with such events is essential.  For those whose career or job means they may run into such issues, they too will benefit from reading this book.      May the treasures learned from this book help you be aware of those around you who face this issue....that the precious gift of life not be wasted!   Susanne\nFengler", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We don't have your abdomen. So we don't eat. We\n     don't have a digestive system. So we don't produce wastes. We don't feel\n     pain because we don't have a nervous system. And, we don't sense fear,\n     simply because emotions are not wired to our cellular motor.  General...:\n     Our brain operates our physical body, how do you operate your body?Alien:\n     What you see is a frame. I can leave it here, and go somewhere\n     else. It will disintegrate on its own and I continue somewhere else. And,\n     I can keep doing this endlessly.  Military\n     scientist: Then inside your body, you don't have blood or fluids?Alien:\n     Since we do not have circulatory system, blood circulation, we don't need\n     the organ you call heart. And since our essence does not have tissues and\n     muscles, no nutrition is necessary, no food is required, no water is required\n     to keep them functioning and growing. We are an intelligent mechanism,\n     very peaceful, very alert, very knowledgeable of the universe and also\n     very familiar with you and your origin.\n                                                                                  Military\n     scientist: Can you explain our origin?Alien:\n     Some of you were made from cosmic fibers you call it dust (cosmic dust).\n     Others were the product of what you call photosynthesis or biosynthesis.\n     And the rest were genetically reproduced and updated by a highly advanced\n     race, not from Earth. And your origin is more animal than human. And at\n     the beginning of your time on earth, some of your species, looked like\n     reptilians, frogs, birds and other aquatic creatures. Some of your early\n     human species, walked on three legs, others on four. And you could not\n     tell the difference from one specie and another because all belong to the\n     early form of the animalistic world or animals' world.  Military\n     Psychologist: How come you know so much about our life, custom and history\n     and what we do on earth?Alien:\n     This is a very simple matter. Everything you do and you've done does not\n     vanish. The substance of everything you have done, whether physical or\n     mental takes on a new shape, a new form. Nothing in the Universe comes to\n     an end but it transforms itself into something else. If not, the Universe\n     will seize to exist. If each time, part of the Universe, part of earth,\n     part of the stars, part of the rocks, part of the air, part of the water\n     vanishes and disappears, the Universe will be missing a lot of things.\n     And, if this continues endlessly the Universe will be empty. But the idea\n     of emptiness does not exist. There is no such thing as an empty space\n     because if there is something like an empty space you will not be able to\n     find it. And, to know where this empty space is, you have to know the limit\n     of the empty space by comparing it to a full space. The fact that you are\n     doing this means, you have given a size, shape, space and border to the\n     empty space. And, when you are able to localize and define its perimeter and\n     limits, you just proved it exists. This is a matter of mathematics and\n     physics, according to your science. So everything you have done on earth\n     has been preserved from the beginning of earth time. We can tap into it,\n     if we are interested. But we are not interested in humanity affairs. You\n     have been broadcasting for sometime now. And the frequencies of your\n     programs and your music are well preserved. But not as many of your\n     thought that they have reached us because we are very far away. And all\n     the frequencies of your noise, and music, were retained in your earth/\n     solar system perimeter. We knew about you, and also other advanced\n     societies in the Universe, knew about you from a very, very long time ago.\n     But, you had nothing to offer us. And if you wonder why then we are here\n     on earth, if we are not interested in you I can give you lots of answers. Some\n     of the Galactic community members lived on earth before and your ancestors\n     called them gods and goddesses. Many left earth while others remained\n     here. And with those who have remained here on earth we share information\n     with by means and ways incomprehensive to your mind. We enter and exit\n     your sky/atmosphere through time pockets. And this also is something new\n     to you, that you now are not capable of understanding, but in the future\n     you will.   General..: How do you explain thecrash of alien\n     spaceships?Alien:\n     They never crashed, they were smashed because they bumped against the time-wall.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dr.\n     X: What do you mean?          Alien:\n     I used the word wall so you can understand it physically. It is not a wall\n     in the physical sense, it is a point of an entrance and exit that opens up\n     and closes up in a matter of seconds. When the space craft enters this point\n     successfully, it will exit successfully. It has only a few seconds,\n     sometimes a fraction of a second to do that. If the space craft misses the\n     opening of the point or reaches the point that just closed it becomes\n     solid. And, when it hits it, it smashes itself.                                                                                                                         General\n     R...: So what we heard from other alien species about how their space craft\n     crashed is not correct. We were told they were hit by an electrical\n     discharge and they crashed to the ground.Alien:  This is not correct at all, because our\n     communities are very advanced, even you in your limited/primitive\n     standards, you have developed tools and ways to protect yourselves from\n     electrical discharges and lightning.  You use a rod on the top of your\n     buildings and homes to protect your homes from lightening and other\n     atmospheric discharges. Many of your primitive airplanes were struck by lightning\n     and still did not go down. Our machines are well protected against your\n     atmosphere elements as well as other spaces and zooming dimensions.", "related": [], "rank": 1716119, "title": "TRANSCRIPTS OF THE ALIENS-USA MEETINGS Volume II. 6th Edition (UFOS & EXTRATERRESTRIALS ABOVE TOP SECRET Files Book 2)", "author": "Maximillien de Lafayette", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It wasn't long before Stone was creating his own literary fantasies, utilizing the personality traits of his friends, teachers and even kids he didn't get along with at school. His first attempts were comic books starring himself as a superhero he started writing and illustrating back in third grade. I like to take people's best or worst characteristics and push them into new characters with totally different identities, he explains of his writing style. Today the fifteen year old high school freshman lives in Atlanta, GA; Stone is an honor roll student and has received numerous academic accolades. In addition to writing, he is an avid soccer player and enjoys science and psychology . Stone says he wants people that read his books to take away the fact that life is a challenge that needs to be endured. Life is not always going to be easy.

It shrieked, flinging numerous tendrils towards me and sweeping\nme off my feet before I knew what was happening. I was pulled into it,\nsubmerged until only my head was sticking out, the mass itself like warm flesh\nrather than a wet liquid. The grasp it had then tightened to hold me in place,\neating away my clothing and leaving my skin unblemished.\"Let go!\" Despite struggling with the little strength I had\nleft in my aching body, my limbs could barely move. There was no escape as the\ntepid slime squirmed and hugged me all over, the texture filling me with a\nnumbingly sweet contentment as it caressed me. It was wriggling violently, the\nripples it released making me feel like hundreds of tongues were licking me\neverywhere.Even my breasts didn't go unmolested as the substance around\nthem began to move and tighten, spiraling slowly around my nipples like tiny\neddies that gradually went faster and faster, filling the hardening knobs with\na foreign bliss that left me trembling. But, to my horror, it seemed intent to\nviolating me as the slime around my crotch began to thicken and swirl as well,\nforming a hard mass that pressed against the untouched haven between my legs.\"Please, no!\" I begged. Only Jacob was allowed to be inside\nof me, to impregnate me with his warm and nurturing seed as soon as we were\nwedded. Yet this inhuman creature was about to defile me. \"No! Don't--\"My cries went\nunheeded, cut short and turned into a scream as it forced its way inside me. It\nplugged between the tight walls and then expanded, swelling until my mind was\nunraveling at the sense of fullness. The walls were pushed to their limits, leaving\nme fearing that I was going break as it started to move.It fucked me, the swollen shaft merciless as it pumped the\nsmall hole and ruined me. Leaving no part of me unmolested, the sound of the\nslime writhing over me was almost hypnotic. My mind blurred as the pain melted,\nblending into candied pleasure seamlessly as it the gelatinous creature went\nfaster and faster. Between how viciously it rammed itself into me and massaged\nmy body all over, my mind betrayed me with carnal delight peppering every\nthought in my head while my body surrendered.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wrote steadily through her school days, first in Colchester and later as a boarder at the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she wrote, produced, and performed in a costume play. After her return to London in 1920 she enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where she studied drama and speech training in a successful attempt to overcome a childhood stammer. There she met Phillip Youngman Carter, who would become her husband and collaborator, designing the jackets for many of her future books. The Allingham family retained a house on Mersea Island, a few miles from Layer Breton, and it was here that Margery found the material for her first novel, the adventure story Blackkerchief Dick (1923), which was published when she was just nineteen. She went on to pen multiple novels, some of which dealt with occult themes and some with mystery, as well as writing plays and stories - her first detective story, The White Cottage Mystery, was serialized in the Daily Express in 1927.

Savignon, Pennsylvania State University, USA\"It is exciting to see a new edition of the well-regarded and usefulRoutledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning. The second edition features updated entries, new topics, and several editorial enhancements that make this already-helpful single-volume encyclopedia even easier to use. Covering a wide range of historical, geographical, conceptual, and empirical ground related to language teaching and learning worldwide, the entries are just the right length—short enough to be accessible in a busy world, yet long enough to provide a sufficient scholarly overview of the relevant topic. The references and suggested reading that accompany the near-200 entries, as well as the cross-listing of topics within the volume, all provide immediate places for the reader to go for further study. For audiences that range from students to classroom teachers to researchers, from novices in the field to those with extensive experience, and from those who want a quick overview of an unfamiliar term or concept to those who wish to spend time exploring the numerous interconnections among topics within the volume, the second edition of theRoutledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learningwill prove to be a valuable asset.\"George C. Bunch, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA\"The Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learningis a ‘must-have’ for anyone with an interest in this area. Whilst the first edition was very good, the second is even better. Once picked up, it is extremely difficult to put down. The coverage is comprehensive. The structure is user-friendly. The writing is accessible. The references and suggestions for further reading have been brought right up to date. This new edition should feature on the book shelves of every undergraduate, postgraduate, teacher and University lecturer. The support it offers is first class and serves as a very helpful launch-pad into almost any language-related topic.\"Gary Chambers, University of Leeds, UKPraise for the first edition\"This encyclopedia is valuable for many different purposes. Most of its entries read easily which is a definite plus for this kind of book. It is a rich source of knowledge and reference material for professionals within language teaching ... I would not hesitate to use some entries as background texts for a graduate course in second language acquisition. But most entries in this encyclopedia do not need to be taught: they will draw the interested reader in on their own merits.\"Sigrid Dentler", "related": [], "rank": 4935006, "title": "Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning", "author": "Michael Byram", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent most of his professional career in New England, working in computer manufacturing and distribution. After he retired in 2009 near Phoenix Arizona, he needed to utilize his pent-up creativity and turned to writing fiction as an outlet. In the last two years, he has published five novels in the Scott Tucker Series. Dick continues to display his ability to craft diversified and thought-provoking short stories. Eleven competition entries came in first, and were published in an anthology with over thirty other authors. He continues to enter competitions and has won several times this year, and those stories will be published in a second anthology in 2014. Dick writes the kind of novel he would like to read. He feels if a reader doesn’t finish one of his novels, he has failed that reader. “…Very interesting characters and the well thought out plot just wouldn't let me put the book down…” His current Scott Tucker series consists of five novels, all involving a serial-killer, or killers. Each novel creates a personal need for Scott Tucker to get involved and help solve the murders. The first novel starts while Scott is attending Harvard as an undergraduate and the others continue following his graduation. Dick uses his knowledge of New England, along with his experience as a Real Estate Broker, member of the National Guard, and business analyst to weave suspense-filled novels that are designed to be ‘page turners.’ “…great suspense/mystery that will draw you in and won't let you go until the last page is read…” As a former certified project manager he uses many of his analytical and planning skills to design and structure plots that create interesting stories. His writing style has been compared to best-selling author Robert B. Parker, who also writes about New England in short chapter format. Dick’s chapters also blend the story from different characters’ perspectives, including the antagonist. This intermingling creates suspenseful novels that urge the reader to read one more chapter to learn what happens. His main genre is mystery; however his novels could be classified as suspense thrillers. His goal is to have at least one best-selling novel in the very near future. He is an active member of Arizona Authors, Desert Sleuths Mystery Writers and Sisters in Crime. He contributes monthly posts for Indies Unlimited which supports independent authors.

Hopgood challenges those concerned with humanitarianism to look beyond Western-led human rights organizations, especially to activists working within their own communities, for hope. VERDICT It seems certain that this book will cause both celebration and discomfort, even outrage, within the human rights community. Readers with an interest in human rights policy, humanitarianism, and even cultural history more broadly will find much to like in Hopgood's brisk, witty prose, even if they are discomfited by his arguments.—Rachel Bridgewater,Library Journal(Dec. 1, 2013)\"The Endtimes of Human Rightsis a brilliant book. Stephen Hopgood puts forward an important and controversial argument about the cultural parochialism of the human rights regime and predicts that we are coming to the end of the 'church of human rights.' Drawing on cultural history, Hopgood traces the political foundations of humanitarianism as a parochial expression of European and especially Christian values, and its unconscious use of universal language to push forward the cultures and values of European Christianity. Hopgood takes us to the edge of a future where our comfortable and comforting language of human rights is unmasked for what it is: a language that grows out of particular cultures and historical circumstances at a time when these cultures are no longer dominant and circumstances have changed as power shifts in the global system. For many, this will come as an unpalatable, even shocking argument.\"—Janice Stein, Belzberg Professor of Conflict Management in the Department of Political Science and the Director of the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, author ofThe Cult of Efficiency\"The Endtimes of Human Rightsis one of those books that will grab the reader's attention from the first page to the last. At the heart of this stimulating and arresting indictment of Human Rights as a movement consisting of believers, institutions, discourses, and ideologies. Stephen Hopgood asserts with sophistication and wit that it was virtually inevitable that Human Rights was founded on something of a false promise, that it was nearly inevitable that it would become 'corrupted' and twisted because of its own internal contradictions, that this corruption has led to its demise, and the consequence will be the end of the last of the great ideologies of the West. Some will object furiously to Hopgood's argument. Others will feel elightened and grateful by his bold argument. But all will be provoked, and it will be impossible to think about international human rights in the same way.\"—Michael Barnett, George Washington University, author ofEmpire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism\"This barnstormer of a book is both rigorous and a page-turner, both provocative and careful, both deconstructive and constructive. Stephen Hopgood challenges all fans of human rights with the prospect that the human rights movement is collapsing in its moral authority. Whether readers shake or nod their heads as they make their way through the pages—and I find myself doing both—they will find themselves engaged in a sparkling conversation with a lively intellect.\"—Daniel Philpott, University of Notre Dame\"Human rights, Stephen Hopgood argues in this hard-hitting provocation, began as the last version of Europe's Christianity but was transformed into the imperial language of America’s hegemony. Hopgood compellingly analyzes the mutation of advocacy from sentimental compassion at the grassroots level to 'international justice’ among elites, preparing his powerful call for a return to the decentralized movement that first allowed humanism traction.The Endtimes of Human Rightssuggests that when the church goes wrong, the time can come to call for a reformation or even to celebrate a Black Mass.\"—Samuel Moyn, Columbia University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A busy work schedule currently excludes partners, pets and children, but I hope, eventually, to enjoy all three.I have been writing short stories for as long as I can remember. Over the last ten years, erotic fiction has gradually seduced and dominated my creativity. We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": ["B00GIVFXFM"], "rank": 3138013, "title": "A lifetime in thirty minutes", "author": "Alexandra Amalova", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his family, counting in-laws, there are now two retired principals, two retired teachers, a retired school counselor, and an active science teacher. In his youth, J.C. read quite a lot. The Call of the Wild was one of his early favorites, and into middle school he began to devour other books such as Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. Unfortunately, J.C. developed a form of dylexia that made reading from the page of a book difficult. It was later discovered that the curvature of the page itself caused the issue, and the advent of the eReader (with its perfectly flat screen) has allowed him to once again enjoy reading as he used to. He enjoys both indoor and outdoor pursuits including computers, cars, and camping. J.C., his wife, and his three boys enjoy hockey, and set aside time several times each season to watch the local WHL franchise.", "related": [], "rank": 2457077, "title": "Columbus", "author": "J.C.

His mother, Saint Helen, had gone to Jerusalem where she reportedly found true cross of Christ and brought with her an earth shaking secret to her son. The Emperor passed that secret on to the Bishop of Jerusalem and swore him and all of his successors to secrecy forever on pain of death and the loss of his soul. Over the 1600 years in the ensuing centuries it was believed that all copies of this Bible were lost. The episcopal custodians of the Bible in Jerusalem have kept in their possession the Bible received from the hands of the Emperor Constantine. They have diligently observed their vow of secrecy. Its revelation could destroy modern Christianity - until now.     Bridget and Scott Donovan, dismissed in disgrace from their academic positions because perpetrating a hoax in their discovery of the true Crown of Thorns, learned that one of the Bibles is still in existence. If they can recover this valuable artifact and prove to the world its authenticity they will have a chance to redeem themselves.     Their search takes them from the deepest recesses of the Amazon jungle to a penthouse in New York City where they meet a new member of their team imposed upon them by their benefactor. The word of the Bibles existence will certainly leak. Scurrying to Jerusalem to find it before anyone else can, they are intercepted by old enemies and new ones that were supposed to be friends.     On learning of the Bibles existence the Vatican exhibited extreme interest in acquiring this Bible. One of its primary investigators, Father Jonathan McGregor, is dispatched to secure this sacred manuscript. The chase that ensues involves the FBI, urban terrorists, the Vatican, and other forces determined to hide the monumental secret in this Bible from the rest of the world.Bridget Donavan's archenemy is determined she will die before acquiring the Bible.", "related": ["B00DOM12E4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

Avera is about a little fish named Ella. She is dreading her first day of school. She is convinced that she is going to have a horrible day and the other fish will laugh at and make fun of her because she is so small. Unfortunately, her fears turn into reality. During her first few classes, her classmates laugh at her, and the bully in the school even butchered the ABC song to include Ella's new cruel nickname. However, things change at the end of the day in music class. Ella soon learns that even though her classmates weren't very kind to her, you \"should treat others like you want them to treat you.\"In the world we live in, we are constantly bombarded with news about bullies and the severe consequences that result from different types of bullying. It's unfortunate but true. Ella Minnow Peed is a refreshing yet fun story with a very important message. We've heard it a thousand times throughout our lives, but the meaning is completely relevant and critical for all children to understand. Treat others the way you want to be treated. John D. Avera does a fantastic job of incorporating this message into Ella's story. Not only is the plot and message significant, but the story itself is captivating. Children will be able to relate to little Ella's fears and end up rooting for her. The end will not only teach them a lesson but will make them smile as well. Plus, the illustrations are adorable and reminiscent of elementary school drawings, which children will love. I would definitely recommend this book to all parents and teachers of young children. It's a fun and engaging way to teach them about an essential life lesson.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We are drawn to people who exhibit these features. In my early days of living in Japan, I had the privilege to study with a most respected and honored teacher, Uchiyama Kosho Roshi. He was like a walking fig tree grounded with a tough inner spirit and a sweetness that uplifted his words. Just prior to his death at the age of 86, sitting inside his hermitage in Uji, Japan while drinking a cup of hot, aromatic green tea, Roshi told me, \"The most important thing you can do is to be a refined person.\" I must say I pondered this simple sentence for a long time, not quite understanding how this might look or feel. Having spent my life studying movement and speech patterns, I decided Roshi's idea of refinement seemed to be an essential ingredient of an authentic presentation, one that arises from truth and addresses the highest ideals in each of us.    Within the pages that follow, I have attempted to describe how the recognition of strength, wisdom and courage in each of us is a vital part of the indispensable rules for inspiring and motivating an audience. Interspersed within these guidelines for effective speaking, I have made comparisons of American presentations to those given in other countries, including Japan, other areas of Asia, and at times, Europe. I will take you into stories of challenge and achievement; at other moments the direction will be more psychologically inclined, encouraging you to explore your motives, desires and way of participating in life. But all roads will lead back to the ways of refinement as the defining attribute in your professionally attractive presentation.Joseph Britton", "related": [], "rank": 4839875, "title": "Attractive Presentations", "author": "Joseph Britton", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
