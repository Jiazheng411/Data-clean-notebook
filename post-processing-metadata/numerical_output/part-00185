Despite thematically arranged chapters (coffee shops, travel), this anthology doesn't quite hang together—in part because the contributors have interpreted the assignment in so many different ways. Some draw literal or metaphorical interpretations of actual ads; some make up their own; some mock the entire concept; a few simply address the idea of missed connections but don't deal with personal ads. The book's real value is as a snapshot of the current state of the mini-comics scene, in which editor Wertz is something of a star. Nearly every significant mini-comics artist of the moment is represented here, including Lucy Knisley, Kazimir Strzepek, Sarah Glidden, Alec Longstreth, and, best of all, Laura Park, who contributes a few splendid, cruelly funny pieces. There are a few bigger names in the collection (like Peter Bagge and Jeffrey Brown), but the roster will probably look a lot more impressive in a few years.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does. She makes no excuses for the darkness surrounding them, especially the paranormal creatures, and says that this is their world. She's just honoured to write down their adventures.", "related": ["B00G61DDDI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

PI Tom Hickey, drafted in his late 30s and deserted by a wife who deems him both too honorable and too poor, agrees to help young soldier Clifford Rose rescue his beautiful but simpleminded young sister, Wendy, from the Tijuana dive where she dances nude. Hickey, an MP stationed at the border crossing near San Diego, Calif., has useful connections. But the mission is complicated by the sinister Senor Zarp, a Nazi thug using Wendy in certain bloody rites designed to bolster the local German populace and corrupt Mexican officials in their support of the fatherland. Freeing Wendy, Clifford is killed and Hickey finds himself the guardian of an otherworldly innocent to whom he is painfully attracted. When she tells him about a mountain of gold being held by Zarp and an obscenely wealthy Mexican family, Hickey, with the aid of a few poor Indian laborers, decides to commandeer the loot and derail a Nazi invasion scheme. Kuhlken ( Midheaven ) weaves a complex plot around a complex man, a weary hero who tries to maintain standards as all around him fall to temptation.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now Mathews (UNC–Chapel Hill) and co-editor Schweiger (University of Arkansas) offer a state-of-the-field anthology showcasing work by young, cutting-edge scholars of Southern religion. Emily Bingham's essay on the \"apostasy\" of antebellum Jewish North Carolinian Rachel Mordecai Lazarus sheds new light not only on the Southern Jewish experience but also on the nature of evangelicalism and religious revivals. Kurt Berends examines the oddly understudied question of how \"the Civil War shape[d] Christianity in the Confederacy,\" arguing that in the 1860s, Southern doctrines of salvation changed. No longer was Jesus' blood the only path to heaven; a hero's death on the battlefield also provided entry through the pearly gates. The gem here is Mathews's own essay on lynching, which examines a central image of the postbellum South—that of Christ-like black men hanging on trees. Caveat emptor: this is a decidedly academic anthology. The primary audience is scholars, and armchair historians who pick up this volume may wish to skip those essays (like Schweiger's) that are primarily concerned with historiography, not history. For professional historians, though, this is an excellent introduction to new fields of inquiry in Southern religion.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For over twenty years, I have been a student of personal development methodologies and continue to transform my own life while assisting others from all walks of life and ages to address challenges at work/home and to get more of what they desire in life. As a certified NLP(neuro-linguistic programming) trainer I have been delivering seminars and coaching services since 1996. I am the father of four, an avid gardener and nature lover and enjoy lending a hand to others.I believe that each of us can achieve the success we desire by developing our authentic selves, mastering internal and external congruence and taking charge of our lives.My first book,Live Your Dreams Let Your Reality Catch Up: NLP and Common Sense for Coaches, Managers and You, is based on NLP, which had a great impact on changing how I saw myself and the world around me. This book serves as an introduction to NLP and includes many of the questions that I asked myself on my personal journey as well as some of my personal discoveries.Live Your Dreams Let Reality Catch Up: 5 Step Action Planprovides, as the title suggests, a process for achieving your dreams. The main idea behind NLP and all of my books is simply: Don't wait for the conditions to be right, for someone to give you their blessing, for the stars to be in alignment; have a dream (no matter how big or small), take action, pay attention, make adjustments as necessary and feel good about yourself.This year (2010), I published my third and fourth books,Parents' Handbook: NLP and Common Sense Guide for Family Well-BeingandNLP Techniques Anyone Can Use. As I say inParents' Handbook, \"I wish I had known NLP when I first became a parent. In fact, I wish I'd had the opportunity to learn and practice NLP concepts when I first went to school.

Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII’s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible.

She molded America's youth, busted kids for smoking pot in the restrooms, and broke up illicit affairs behind the stage on a regular basis, so she finally decided to hang up her hat and let someone else have all the fun. (Liliana's Addison Holmes Mystery Series, about a small town teacher who gets into a whole lot of trouble, is somewhat autobiographical, but she won't confess to which parts). Liliana began reading romance novels with all her new found free time, and when she ran out of things to read, she decided to write her own novels. The result was a 150,000 word thriller--a dazzling adventure--where the heroine was a thirty-year-old virgin assassin (Yes, you read that right). She couldn't imagine why people weren't knocking down her door to read it, but she persevered and began writing a second book. She finally got the hang of things, and eventually learned that losing one's virginity wasn't all that romantic after all. All of her books involve some kind of suspense (she just can't help herself), laughter, and a lot of steamy sex. Since the failure of her first attempt, Liliana's books have won awards such as: The Daphne Du Maurier, The Suzannah, The Linda Howard Award of Excellence, The Maggie, and many others. Her affiliations include Romance Writers of America and Mystery Writers of America. Liliana loves to cook, and is addicted to reading, Internet Boggle, kickboxing, and Bones. She lives in a big, rambling house in Texas with a couple of cats to keep her company. She loves to get emails from readers.

In the final paper on the Oedipus complex, Klein develops her theories of the earliest infant stages of development, extending Freud's analysis of the Oedipus complex and laying a basis for her own subsequent conceptualising of the paranoid-schizoid position in the first six months of life.

The rapidly developing plot burns through pages faster than the first time\nFleming took us to Beirut. An\nintelligent thriller teeming with vigor.\"KIRKUS REVIEWS\"Fleming provides a sharp sense of place and time. The\nvarious threads mesh fairly well in a believable portrait of how professional\nliars and secret-keepers navigate love and war. The well-machined flow of the\nstory displays Fleming's skill as a writer of literate, thoughtful thrillers\nthat have more to share than a mastery of genre mechanics.\" PACIFIC BOOK REVIEW\"BRIDE OF A BYGONE WAR is an engaging look at the Lebanese\nwar. BRIDE has the feel of an insider's look behind the secrecy and complexity\nof the multiple players in the region. Beyond the people that Fleming writes\nabout, it is the setting that really shines. The descriptions of the city and\nthe countryside, along with the ebb and flow of daily life really make BRIDE\nshine outside of the conventional spy thriller.\" SAN FRANCISCO BOOK REVIEW\"An intelligence officer who has dodged\nmaking decisions and cleaning up his messes is forced to face the consequences,\nshowing resourcefulness and decency...when at last he must.

(George Skau, professor of history (ret), Bergen Community College, NJ )The instruction of sixth grade involves the teaching of writing, reading, and math and developing best practices that will combine the three strands within one lesson. The level V Précis of the EPILLAW Taxonomy is a perfect example of how a teacher can take advantage of a lesson reflective of composition skills, while assimilating the practice of reading, along with enforcing a child’s ability to synthesize language and understand fractions as well. (Paula Altman Clarke, M.A. doctoral candidate and elementary school teacher )InLearn to Think and Write,Sarno enlivens her excellent and practical text with a world of stories. Students are introduced to stories about a Mexican-American girl and an African boy, readings from classic children's literature, and selections from exciting non-fiction. (Aileen Gianelli Ph.D, doctoral advisor, Fordham University )This book provides readers with an innovative and very useful methodology for the teaching of language and deals specifically with the skills of listening, speaking, writing and then reading, in an order which is supported by a well-structured and original taxonomy (or EPILLAW Paradigm). I believe this book to be of very considerable benefit to teachers of the particular age group dealt directly with by Dr McGinley Sarno. More importantly, it has many very useful applications to teachers generally. The style is mature and experienced and the book is full of interesting insights.(Dr. Maureen Killeavy, director, National Teacher Induction Programme PP, University College Dublin )Dr Sarno has selected Mr. Dru's Joshua's Masai Mask as the final test in both her textbooks. This story provides African American male children with appropriate role models and shows how she selected material to appeal to a wide range of school children. As an educator who promotes diverse learning experiences for culturally and linguistically diverse children, Dr. Sarno's contribution is an exemplar of culturally relevant pedagogy.(Noran L.

Those terribly written, yet funny to read, short stories often held some resemblance to my life growing up on a 39 acre farm in Williamsburg, OH, a small town east of Cincinnati. There were horses, cows, pigs, dogs, cats, okay, a zoo, which included three older brothers. I left this wonderful life behind at eighteen to pursue a degree in Journalism and then a career in Marketing. After ten years of living in the city, I moved back to Williamsburg and bought those same 39 acres I grew up on. I eventually married my best friend, Jack, and allowed him and his son to move in with me, my two dogs and two horses. Since then, we’ve added another horse and built our dream home, a log cabin. The desire to write and become publishing was never far from my mind. It pushed at me until I could no longer ignore the stories running through my head. Then one day, sitting in an airport on my way home from a business trip, I wrote the first chapter of Two Brothers. Once that first book was written, well, then I had to figure out what to do with it. I joined Romance Writers of America, as well as my local chapter, which eventually led me to Turquoise Morning Press and the release of my first book, Two Brothers.

She had locked herself out of her car and the two men offered help. In turn, Rossetti bought them a pack of beer and offered a ride. Logan and Gillies, both psychopaths with long criminal records, first wanted her money but then spontaneously escalated their crimes until ultimately they had abducted Rossetti, raped her five times, and finally threw her down a ravine in the Superstition Mountains, where they stoned her and left her to die. Watkins, an adult probation officer responsible for writing pre-sentencing reports, including reports on Gillies and Logan, has done an admirable job in researching the lives of the protagonists and in re-creating the murder of Rossetti and the capture and trial of the men. However, Evil Intentions reads like a pre-sentence report itself, lacking a sense of excitement or impending doom. It is written totally in the past tense, with only dialog from the trial transcript and odd juxtapositions of information causing confusion. Not recommended.-Sandra K.

Her mother is injured and her father is away, so the brave girl must rely on the skills her parents have taught her. She secures the horses, including her beloved mare, and musters up the courage to confront unsavory characters both inside and outside her village to save the animals. Kalli's character has the most depth, though readers will find her friends bring levity and warmth to her story and challenge her to take risks and grow in ways she may not have on her own. In the end, it is her mother's approval that is most satisfying to the young heroine. The writing feels forced when the characters and the scenery are introduced, but the rich storytelling, including descriptions of daily life and the landscape, and some impressive riding sequences, propel the action forward. Historical and cultural details are well integrated, as are facts about horses, and Harrison provides further information in the afterword. This novel, with its strong female protagonist and suspenseful sequences, may appeal to a broad range of readers.-Hilary Writt, Sullivan University, Lexington, KYα(c) Copyright 2011.

Perhaps Oppenheim's most enduring creation is the character of General Besserley, the protagonist of General Besserley's Puzzle Box and General Besserley's New Puzzle Box (one of his last works). His work possesses a unique charm, featuring protagonists who delight in Epicurean meals, surroundings of intense luxury, and the relaxed pursuit of criminal practice, on either side of the law. His first novel was about England and Canada, called Expiation (1887); followed by such titles as The Betrayal (1904), The Avenger (1907), The Governors (1908), The Double Life of Mr. Alfred Burton (1913), An Amiable Charlatan (1915), The Black Box (1915), The Double Traitor (1915), The Cinema Murder (1917), The Box with Broken Seals (1919), The Devil's Paw (1920) and The Evil Shepherd (1922).", "related": ["B00AOQ8S3Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hobbs lives in a small town in Northeast Texas, with her husband, son, and the sweetest cat that has ever graced the Earth. She has always enjoyed reading stories filled with romance, adventure, fantasy, and mystery.  In recent years, however, she has taken these passions to a new height in discovering her own voice through writing fiction.This challenge began for her several years ago when she took a huge step and nervously joined an online group of young writers, who had the same passion she did for exploring other possible plots for their favorite stories. She had almost completed her first lengthy such project and felt she needed to find a place where others could enjoy reading it as well.When that project ended at approximately 110,000 words, she knew she could do more and searched for a way to put her talent and love of writing into motion for a more beneficial means.For her, writing is a way of traveling to places and times that would otherwise be impossible to touch and feel.  She has found the ability to create new characters and form their lives rewarding, and it brings her a feeling of accomplishment.Through writing, she has found that she not only feels better about herself, she also has a great sense of satisfaction knowing that she has created something that someone else can enjoy.For this author, romance is a fundamental component in what she enjoys writing.  Whether it is the Native American captive tale or a historical novel set on the rolling, misty moors in 18th century England, she loves sharing the world she has created with others.T.M. Hobbs has had the good fortune of having several of her short stories and novels published.  She has worked with Books To Go Now and Gypsy Shadow Publishing, to name a few.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 44.0}

Reading and drama were inculcated from an early age and both have borne adult fruit in acting, directing and writing. Elizabeth returned to the England of Mary Quant and geometric hair, and ended a brief secretarial career by landing in drama school and thence treading the boards. In her thirties, Elizabeth discovered her true métier as a writer and fulfilled an early addiction to Georgette Heyer by launching into historical romance. It took the proverbial lengthy apprenticeship before Harlequin Mills & Boon accepted her first novel, but they have overall published 18 of her novels. Elizabeth’s writing recently swerved in a new direction with the publication of the first two in a Georgian historical crime series, THE GILDED SHROUD and THE DEATHLY PORTENT, published by Berkley Books (Penguin US). But since she still loves writing romance, Elizabeth is delighted with the opportunity to publish her work independently.

In addition to crafting fiction and poetry, her writing experience encompasses twenty-plus years of scripting technical resources and training documentation for numerous corporations throughout the United States and abroad.  Deborah's first writing endeavors began in junior high school when she scribbled poetry into a science class lab book. An astute teacher encouraged those initial writings and in 1986, Deborah placed second in the Stamford Festival of the Arts Literary Competition for her nonfiction essay, THE EYES OF MY CHILDREN. In 1995, Deborah won the Good Housekeeping / Kindercare Essay Contest with her entry, WHAT I WANT FOR MY SONS. In 2000, Deborah's fictional novel, RESTED WATERS, was one of three finalists in the Sonja H. Stone Fiction Competition judged by author, Edwidge Danicat, and officially released under the MaGregor Press imprint in 2011. Deborah's first novel, TAKE ME TO HEART, published by BET Books' Arabesque imprint was released in December 2003 and was a 2004 Romance SlamJam Best New Author nominee. In 2005 she received Book of the Year and Favorite Heroine nominations for her third novel THE RIGHT SIDE OF LOVE. Recognized as a national best-selling author, Mello's fifth book, LOVE IN THE LINEUP was released by Harlequin in August 2006 under their new Kimani Press imprint and in 2009 she won a Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Award for her ninth novel TAME A WILD STALLION. With the release of her second literary work, GRAYE in 2012 and her fifteenth romance novel, PASSIONATE PREMIERE in 2013, Deborah knows that there are no limits to her writing career. For Deborah, writing is as necessary as breathing. Weaving a story that leaves her audience feeling full and complete, as if they've just enjoyed an incredible meal, is an ultimate thrill for her.", "related": ["B00BJU0Q4U"], "rank": 1788749, "title": "Graye", "author": "Deborah Fletcher Mello", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Haas, a senior fellow with the American Foreign Policy Council and the author of the excellent new bookSound the Trumpet: The United States and Human Rights Promotion, notes that Obama has expressed admiration for the elder Bush and exhibits a similar approach. Like Bush 41, Haas says, Obama ‘operates as a classic realist, not a human rights promoter.’ Also in the realist vein, Obama ‘lacks a vision as to where he would like to take the country or the world. He operates from problem to problem.’(The New Republic)Former US government official Haas (senior fellow, American Foreign Policy Council) has produced a lively, opinionated analysis that is easily accessible to the general readership. His account, based on presidential administrations since WW II, portrays the US as \"the world's leading promoter of human rights\" and points to American exceptionalism as the heart of Washington's strong advocacy. Haas accentuates the crucial role of political and civil liberties rather than socioeconomic aspects of human rights, and he perceives a setback in the advance of rights in 2006-11 that has now been righted by the Arab Spring. Despite Haas's overall support for the US mission, he does not shirk from dissecting US failures. His coverage of the Obama administration highlights the president's ability to combine rhetorical idealism with operational realism, but he is highly critical of Obama's \"engagement\" approach toward America's enemies and labels it a \"tragedy.\" Haas skewers Nixon, Ford, and George H. W. Bush, but admires Reagan and is critical of Carter. This study is succinct and well written....Haas's presentation is an excellent overview that is also timely and a good read. Summing Up: Recommended. General readers; upper-division undergraduate students and above.(CHOICE)Larry Haas provides an engaging history of, and compelling argument for, America’s unique role and responsibility as a leader in the advance of human rights around the globe. In a clear and accessible fashion, he illuminates the challenge of balancing strategic and moral interests in a complicated world. Ultimately,Sound the Trumpetmakes a strong case for America’s continued leadership in bringing about a more democratic world.(Joseph I. Lieberman, U.S. Senator, Connecticut)Thomas Jefferson would have loved this book. With stirring prose and real thoughtfulness on thorny questions, Larry Haas shows us where we’ve been and lays out an agenda to renew America’s historic role in spreading democracy to the people of the world. It is a book that is both timely and timeless.(Andrei Cherny, President, Democracy: A Journal of Ideas; author, The Candy Bombers: The Berlin Airlift and America’s Finest Hour)A wise, balanced, and superbly written analysis of America’s commitment to the cause of human rights over the last three-quarters of a century – the victories, the setbacks, the conflicts, and the prospects.(R. James Woolsey, The Honorable)It’s become fashionable to depict the United States as a spent superpower that, humbled by economic weakness and inconclusive wars, must now accommodate itself to a “post-American world.” Larry Haas is having none of it. InSound the Trumpet, he makes a vigorous and compelling case that the United States retains the unique combination of strengths required to catalyze the spread of freedom and democracy in today’s world.(Will Marshall)Larry Haas’ lucid narrative reminds us of the human rights idealism that has animated the foreign policy of every president from Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama. While mindful of the enormous challenges and tragic missteps that have occurred along the route, he leaves the reader proud to be part of a nation that tries so persistently to alleviate human suffering and defend human dignity far from its own shores.(Alice M. Rivlin, former White House Budget Director; former Vice Chair, Federal Reserve)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Generations of readers have responded to the power, precision, and delicacy of J R R Tolkien's linguistic imagination. This absorbing new study of The Hobbit brings a philologist's eye to that work's creation, structure, and expression, positioning it within the broader development of Tolkien's professional thinking about philology and the evolving mythography of his creative writings. Mark Atherton, himself what Tolkien calls 'a scholar of gramarye', imaginatively shows how Tolkien's academic interests in philology, linguistic-aesthetic and in reconstructive philology spilled over into the crucible of his own mythography, and was catalysed by the alchemy of his own reading in myths and contemporary fairy stories by writers such as William Morris, Edward Thomas, Francis Thompson and Robert Graves. This book gives them new ways of appreciating the interplay between his narratives and the linguistic enchantment of their imaginative world. Atherton's insights bring to mind Tolkien's own comment: 'How those old words smite one out of the dark antiquity!' \" - Vincent Gillespie, J R R Tolkien Professor of English Literature and Language, University of Oxford 'Mark Atherton's treatment of one of the most famous books of the twentieth century is timely and welcome.

One reason for the enduring appeal of both of these works is that J R R Tolkien imbued his tales of a fictional realm with resonances of ancient themes and universal truths.

Stapledon's writings directly influenced Arthur C. Clarke, Brian Aldiss, Stanisław Lem, C. S. Lewis and John Maynard Smith and indirectly influenced many others, contributing many ideas to the world of science fiction. The \"supermind\" composed of many individual consciousnesses forms a recurring theme in his work. Star Maker contains the first known description of what are now called Dyson spheres. Freeman Dyson credits the novel with giving him the idea, even stating in an interview that \"Stapledon sphere\" would be a more appropriate name. Last and First Men features early descriptions of genetic engineering and terraforming. Sirius describes a dog whose intelligence is increased to the level of a human being's. Stapledon's fiction often presents the strivings of some intelligence that is beaten down by an indifferent universe and its inhabitants who, through no fault of their own, fail to comprehend its lofty yearnings. It is filled with protagonists who are tormented by the conflict between their \"higher\" and \"lower\" impulses. Last and First Men, a \"future history\" of 18 successive species of humanity, and Star Maker, an outline history of the Universe, were highly acclaimed by figures as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, Hugh Walpole, Arnold Bennett, Virginia Woolf (Stapledon maintained a long correspondence with Woolf) and Winston Churchill. In contrast, Stapledon's philosophy repelled C. S. Lewis, whose Cosmic Trilogy was written partly in response to what Lewis saw as amorality, although Lewis admired Stapledon's inventiveness and described him as \"a corking good writer\". In fact Stapledon was an agnostic who was hostile to religious institutions, but not to religious yearnings, a fact that set him at odds with H. G. Wells in their correspondence. None of Stapledon's novels or short stories has been adapted for film or television, although George Pal bought the rights to Odd John. Castle of Frankenstein magazine reported in 1966 that David McCallum would play the title role. Together with his philosophy lectureship at the University of Liverpool, which now houses the Olaf Stapledon archive, Stapledon lectured in English literature, industrial history and psychology.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not that that bothers me. I am, after all, a huge horror/slasher/gore movie fan. Reading it isn't much different than watching it... The descriptions are fantastic! The city, the people, the creatures, and the battles were extremely well written and I was able to visualize everything that was described. The actual City of Mirage was glorious. Mr. Brooke did a wonderful job of creating a new, strange world and transporting the reader there without coming across as unbelievable. The...author wrote with so much raw emotion during certain scenes that I could feel everything the characters felt. And who doesn't love a book that can really make you feel for the characters like that? Personally, I felt...based on how the story is structured, that much narrative is probably needed. And while there was a lot of action scenes, they felt a bit clunky to me at times. It was like a listing a series of steps to get things accomplished...  I also felt there was a lot of telling and not nearly enough showing...I was so engrossed in the story that I wanted to experience everything firsthand. Overall, it was a quick read with a plot that was easy to follow. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it.

I also dreamt of heroes and villains and the women that inspired the best and worst in them.It seemed like every book I read as a teen was a classic bodice-ripper. Wimpy-virgin-heroine always making bad choices and getting herself in trouble, cue the macho hero, yadda yadda yadda. Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.​", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": 792674, "title": "A Heart of Stone and Fire (Beneath the Veil Book 4)", "author": "Aimee Roseland", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

Welkom is well situated in the heart of the gold mining region, where hundreds of thousands of migrant workers come from all over Africa to work.  This was a “gold mine” for missions.  In only nine years, 7,500 people were saved, baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit.  More than 650 graduated from the church’s Bible School.  Upon returning to their own countries, 27 went into the full-time ministry, and 16 started their own bible schools. In 1990, he handed the church over to his assistant pastors and elders, and immigrated to the United States with his family to start a new church Harvest for Christ and Bible College in San Diego, California. In 1996 he received a DMin from the School of Bible Theology in San Jacinto, California and in 2001 he graduated with a PhD from Life Christian University in Tampa, Florida. In April 1999, his wife Jackie suffered a devastating stroke that destroyed the left hemisphere of her brain, leaving her blind, mute and paralyzed on her right side.  She was confined to a wheelchair.  Pastor Henry retired to become his wife’s caretaker. Thanks to the blessings of God, Jackie has had a miraculous recovery.  She now walks with the aid of a cane; her sight has been restored to 82% of normal, and her speech has returned to 75% of normal. Dr. Henry Wolmarans has authored six books.  In 2004, ‘YOUR RIGHTS TO RICHES’ won first place as the best personal self help book on finances in both Christian and secular fields by the Bay Area Independent Publishers Association.  In 2007, he published his newest book, ‘YES, YOU CAN … ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.’ Dr. Wolmarans has been fortunate to receive personal endorsements from Dr. Oral Roberts, Dr. Pat Robinson, Dr. Robert Schuller, T.L. Osborne, Peter Daniels, and many other high profile ministries. In January 2009, he came out of retirement by instruction of Jesus, the head of the Church, to plant a new work, The Promise, in San Marcos, CA.", "related": [], "rank": 2343035, "title": "God's Plan for Your Life", "author": "Dr. Henry Wolmarans", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Within the first year of studying a Degree in Fine Art, she quickly changed her mind and decided to pursue her life long ambition of becoming a writer, and embarked on a BA (Hons) in Creative Writing. Since then, she has had various careers concerning making balloon animals, serving drinks to drunks, making cakes for charity, teaching inmates various subjects such as art and design and life and social skills, and finally settled on a job at a local college. Elizabeth's favourite places are Stratford Upon Avon, Warwick Castle, Arley Woods and of course round her Nan's for Sunday Dinner. Elizabeth's hobbies consist of eating her weight in chocolate raisins, maltesers, attempting to extend her knowledge beyond 5 chords on the guitar, writing and drinking a vast amount of tea. When not hiding away writing, Elizabeth likes to spend her time with friends and family, occasionally feeding the rabbit, Stavros, and sitting back relaxing with the-bloke-with-the-beard.", "related": ["B00JVUFGCC"], "rank": 899851, "title": "The Girl Who Bit Back (The Adventures of Benedict and Blackwell Book 2) eBook", "author": "E Earle", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 34.0}

Easy to follow recipes, that taste delicious, shopping lists included with weekly meal planners and not only that, Uma even tells you when to pop the plates into warm! What else could you ask for? --Jacqui Cook, PA to Gregg Wallace - MasterChef JudgeUma Wylde is our resident chef! She's confident on air, lively, very professional and her food is absolutely delicious. I've tried a few of her recipes at home and she explains what to do so well, I'll certainly be working my way through the rest of her recipe book, she makes cooking so easy, which is good for someone like me who doesn't have much experience. --Melanie Kimmer, BBC Radio Wiltshire (UK)This recipe book is so different to any other I have. To start with, the binding allows it to sit flat which makes it so useable in the kitchen. Everything is so clearly and helpfully set out. The recipes I have tried so far have been easy to follow, and the results enjoyed. We're looking forward to working our way through it. What a clever idea to add the shopping list along with photos of what many of the ingredients look like so you know what you are looking for in the supermarket!

S. Lewis is the Author of Jamaican American Thug Drama which spawned four sequels. J. S. Lewis's life dramatically changed in 2008, in his last year in high school. At the age of 17 years old, he was targeted by thugs to be gay bashed and chased away from high school after rumours spiralled that he was not only Gay but was infatuated by one of the thugs in his class. This 'dark' period triggered events that would mould and change his life forever and inspired him to write his groundbreaking Novel 'Jamaican American Thug Drama.' \"I began writing Jamaican American Thug Drama back in 2010 and it was inspired by a very dark period in my life, one that has forever changed my life but one that I am very grateful for because I survived it and it led me to my true self. When the story was completed and I saw how it had emotionally impacted readers online, I said to myself \"Oh my god, do I have any idea what I created?\" I felt years of immense pain, deep distress and emotional and psychological trauma loosening their grip on me. I was haunted by these demons for years but through writing, I was finally liberated, I was freed, I experienced a period of what I called rebirth. I felt like a butterfly leaving the casket of its cocoon and if there had been any doubts in my mind prior- they were all gone now and I knew right then and there that this was my calling- writing. A gift as old as time itself and I was one of many who were divinely blessed with it. The events that scarred me actually led me to my true gift and my true self and I promised myself to use this gift not only for myself but for anyone whom it may be able to help, inspire, motivate, mentor, heal, empower, liberate, uplift and share with humanity the magic of light, love and beauty. This is what I believe with all my heart.\"", "related": ["B00HEMHHDK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent most of his childhood with his grandmother Efrosinia Verkhusha, a village healer.As a teenager Vladimir occasionally visited Father Feodorit, a priest of the Trinity-Sergiyev Monastery. Later he was shown there the picture «The One and Only» which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense. On this trip, an encounter with Anastasia in the Siberian taiga changed his entire life.It had been a secret for a long time for relatives and friends what made him, an entrepreneur with ten years experience, to pledge his property and spend his savings on unprofitable trading trips. The mystery was revealed in his books with Anastasia as the main character. Vladimir Megre brought something really invaluable from the trips.Throughout 1996-2006 nine books were written by Vladimir Megre (The Ringing Cedars of Russia Series: Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars of Russia, The Space of Love, Co-Creation, Who Are We?, Book of Kin, The Energy of Life, The New Civilization, Rites of Love).In 2011 the author became Laureate of Gusi Peace Prize.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though comparatively not the same story, The Halleluiah Baby resurrected the feelings that I had when I was younger and read The Little Prince. The purpose and meaning behind each little part of Treez's story grasped my heart and held me close, easing up only long enough to grab hold once more.*Small spoiler*When Treez discovers what she believes to be the true purpose of her journey, a visit to her estranged mother, it does seem to fall short. Personally, I feel that's because Treez discovered all she needed to about her own self along the way, but English teachers could easily take this novel and interpret it to death until they bleed from their ears. (In a good way, since we all know the curtains aren't simply blue to English teachers.)This emotionally charged novella is a must-read. That simple. There's no need to have a type of novel you pursue, or wonder if this is within your typical genre. Go, shoo, get your copy and get to reading!\"  S.A.

This book focuses on the growth of a bee from being an egg to an adult bee. Like the other books in this series, this book is written about a particular bee-related topic, targeting a specified age group. The layout of the book is designed in a way to make it easy for children to clearly comprehend the ideas conveyed. The information about honeybees is divided between twelve books to make reading easy for children. This book is a good educational story. By the time a child finishes reading all twelve books he/she will have an extensive knowledge about honeybees. It is an excellent collection for school and children's libraries. Both teachers and adults can use it for read-aloud sessions at home, libraries and classrooms. The illustrations are bright and attractive. They convey the message the author wants to impart to readers. It will be easy to memorize the parts of a bee's body after reading this book. The word list at the end of the book is very useful. The book serves many purposes. Apart from enhancing your knowledge, it helps in improving your vocabulary.Any children's story book written with an educational concept is good for children. It makes learning easy. Colors and pictures also catch the attention of children. The illustrations are captivating and explain the concept with a lot of clarity.", "related": ["B00HVULLKU"], "rank": 3642880, "title": "Honeybee's Album Volume 9", "author": "Jeanette Vuuren", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Is such involvementand its results truly a revolutionary rejection of what went before? The author uses historical and clinical vignettes throughout to illustrate concepts such as ethics (e.g., formal codes) and morality (e.g., unwritten systems such as truth and forgiveness in clinical training). This makes for interesting and enjoyable reading even in the case of a seemingly arcane subject such as midwives oaths of the seventeenth century...Before Bioethicsreaders may find all or parts of this well written, extensively referenced monograph (available as an e-book) valuable.\" --R. F. Gillum, M.D., Howard University College of Medicine\"Baker provides a new and extremely engaging historical account of medical ethics in the US, including the 17th-century oaths of fidelity and diligence taken by midwives and the early-19th-century codes of the various medical police through the lens of 'morally disruptive technologies.' These discussions set the stage for a better understanding of the standard 20th-century bioethics origin story and the field itself, which the author includes in this work.

It\nshould be annoying because clearly Jake and Emma are meant to be together, but\nthey are both stubborn and want to waste the good relationship that they\nalready have. Even though the two are supposed to be broken up, they are still\naffectionate with each other. The way they care for one another is romantic,\nsuch as when Jake would get Emma's preferred breakfast or when Emma would turn\nto Jake during sad times. The other characters are also very likable,\nespecially the Knight brothers and I'm hoping that they will be the main\ncharacters in the next installments of A Knight's Tale series.  ...Claudia Y. Burgoa's Getting by\n(A Knight's Tale) is a complex and satisfying contemporary novel about two\ndamaged characters whose attraction and affection for each other can flourish\nonly if they can let the past go. Both of them have past traumas and ingrained\npersonality quirks that make reading their story absorbing and entertaining.\nEmma is a strong, vibrant and somewhat eccentric character who at times is\ncomically unaware of how to behave in public. Jake is her superhero, who calms\nher claustrophobia while they're trapped in an elevator together, and grabs a fork\nout of her hand before she stabs the hand of a line-jumper at a buffet. Getting\nby (A Knight's Tale)is a smooth, sometimes funny and intelligent read that\nkeeps the reader intrigued and wanting more, and is highly recommended....Jack Magnus for Readers'\nFavorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 92.0}

The family moved to New Zealand in 2004.  In her later teens she responded to a perceived call to the cloistered life of contemplative prayer. A diagnosis of terminal brain cancer in late 2009 curtailed the way she was able to live out this vocation.  Over the remaining two years of her life she wrapped her past and present in even greater cloistered mystery while she tried to come to terms with her future.  Fascinated by language as much as she was by the interior silence of contemplation, she gravitated to the combination of both that she could find in writing haiku.  In a similar paradoxical manner she hid herself from the world while she reached out  to it through the anonymity of human interaction via the social networking complexities of the internet.  In cyber-companionship with Ted van Zutphen she worked out her identity as girl/woman, nun/social butterfly, contemplative/wordsmith as together they wrote and studied haiku via digital communications. Her work has appeared in a number of online and print journals, anthologies and books.", "related": [], "rank": 4079773, "title": "Language and Silence", "author": "Svetlana Marisova", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00CWN8R1C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has contributed to numerous books for roleplaying games from companies such as: Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing, White Wolf Studios, Bastion Press, and Atlas Games.

While Teckla has always enjoyed writing, mainly journaling, it took her quite a few years to realize that it was much more than a hobby. When she first started seriously writing her first story it took three years to finish. As the story grew so did her desire to share it with others. Now she spends the majority of her free time writing the tales that have been building in her head for years, and she loves every moment of it. Currently, Teckla attends Kansas State University pursuing a degree in Animal Science. Animals are her other passion. One day she would love to have a cottage in the country with horses, dogs, cats, and all kinds of other animals.

Laura's struggle comes in the form of a drastic decision: to accept the limited role of an adult woman in her restrictive, devout village, or to jump the fence into the unknown and make her own way in the world. Lucky battles very real enemies in the dangerous ruined city, and also must solve the mystery of the imposed amnesia from which he suffers. It was an enjoyable challenge to expand what was a complete but very short novel into a longer piece, but the work was rewarding and I believe those who loved \"The Prince\" will enjoy this even more.", "related": ["B00JSZSC76"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
