His startling theory holds that the world's religions are best understood as \"systematic anthropomorphism,\" arising from the universal tendency to ascribe human characteristics to God and gods, to nature, animals, the weather and daily occurrences. People anthropomorphize, he maintains, because they perceive the world in terms of their own interests. Through the perceptual strategy of animism, they attribute life to objects and events, conjuring a panoply of spirit beings, according to Guthrie's schema. As for Buddhism and other creeds with no deities, Guthrie maintains that they are not religions but, rather, ethical or psychological systems. He scrutinizes anthropomorphism in the visual arts and philosophy, drawing on cognitive science, ethnography and psychology to buttress his often debatable points. His theory complements and revises theories that interpret religion as social glue, wish-fulfillment, primitive science or means of interaction with sacred and spiritual realms.

Robert William Chambers (May 26, 1865 – December 16, 1933) was an American artist and fiction writer, best known for his masterpiece, a book of short stories entitled The King In Yellow, published in 1895. He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P. Chambers (1827–1911), a famous lawyer, and Caroline (Boughton) Chambers, a direct descendant of Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island. Robert's brother was Walter Boughton Chambers, the world famous architect. His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is The King in Yellow, a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous weird short stories which are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama, The King in Yellow, which drives those who read it insane. E. F. Bleiler described The King in Yellow as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction. It was also strongly admired by H.P. Lovecraft and his circle. Chambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections The Maker of Moons, The Mystery of Choice and The Tree of Heaven, but none earned him as much success as The King in Yellow. Some of Chambers's work contains elements of science fiction, such as In Search of the Unknown and Police!!!, about a zoologist who encounters monsters. Chambers later turned to writing romantic fiction to earn a living. According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Many of his works were also serialized in magazines. During World War I he wrote war adventure novels, and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as \"Marooned\" in Barbarians (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction. Chambers for several years made Broadalbin, New York, his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown. On July 12, 1898, he married Elsa Vaughn Moller (1882–1939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers). Robert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, after having undergone intestinal surgery three days earlier.", "related": [], "rank": 1199166, "title": "The Yellow Sign (and other tales)", "author": "Robert W.

To dispel the curse of the good girl, and despite using those familiar, easily misconstrued labels as a touchstone, Girls Leadership Institute founder Simmons offers instructive tales out of school and workshops, revealing that flawed communication rituals and fear of confrontation contribute equally to a girl's belief that it is more important to be liked than to be an individual. In order to become a successful, well-adjusted real girl, she needs to know how to say no to peers, ask for what she needs and express what she thinks. In the second half of this book, parents will find concrete strategies and tools—confidence-building exercises that emphasize emotional intelligence, self-evaluations, q&a's, scripts and lots of first-person stories—to help guide a girl's growth into a young woman who can respect and listen to her inner voice, say what she feels and thinks, embrace her limits and present an authentic self to the world.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Spirit, he offers us St. John of the Cross, one of the foremost mystics of the Christian faith. Designed perfectly for Lenten reading, the book is organized into 40 readings culled from the great works of this 16th-century Spanish mystic (some of the finest in Christian literature-Dark Night of the Soul, etc.) and paraphrased by Hazard to make the materials more accessible and applicable to a contemporary reader. Each selection is preceded by appropriate scripture passages and followed by a thoughtful prayer reflecting upon the reading. A word of warning: the spirituality espoused by John of the Cross is not the sweet, comfortable spirituality currently in vogue. For example, John would no doubt find the contemporary concern with self-esteem a matter of grasping pride. John's call instead is to self-denial and true knowledge of God-after the sin and untruth have been burned away from our souls. But, despite the seeming harshness of John's teachings, most readers will find this book a mere appetizer and will want to follow it by trying the works of St. John in their entirety.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00A29XHX6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now Bremmer returns with her newest mystery, Mind Your Manors! where two charred bodies present an especially tough case for Colorado's detective Glen Karst. Complicating matters is the hostility of an inept local sheriff who tries to run Karst out of town! Aided by Karst's psychic friend Jennifer Parker, a favorite bourbon and a tasty cheesecake, Karst weaves his way through a complex web to identify an elusive serial killer. Superbly detailed, populated throughout with engaging and memorable characters, deftly laid out from first page to last with plot twists leading to a surprising conclusion. Mind Your Manors! is a 'must read' for Bremmer's growing legion of fans -- and will aptly serve to introduce a master of the genre to a whole new generation of readers who will eagerly seek out her earlier works! --Midwest Book Review", "related": ["B0031ER172"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is very fitting that her first venture outside the juvenile market would be a book about a subject near and dear to her heart, her Southern roots and upbringing.  Her comedic alter ego, Maxie the Preacher's Wife, has been fertile ground for sharing much of this material with audiences above and below the Mason-Dixon Line.  In addition, her life as the wife of a Baptist preacher has amply supplied her with an endless wealth of Southern stories.  She especially champions Southern women whose many distinctive gifts confirm the fact that being \"raised right\" by Southern Mamas is the best of the best!  Her heart of hearts is to love God with all her heart, mind, soul, and strength, and to love others, especially her Christian sistahs, as herself!   She is mother to three wonderfully creative grown children and two fabulous sons-in-law, Susan and Clark Dailey, Kati and Lew Ayotte, and Rick Brantley.  She is Mimi to her first little grandson, Levi, who fills her days with love and laughter.   In her spare time, she enjoys leading Women's Bible studies/conferences and making people laugh as a Christian comedienne.  She has recorded several comedy and music CDs.  She lives with her husband, Rickey, in a wonderful old farmhouse in Dublin, Georgia with their cat, Pearl. As Maxie would say:  \"Sit back, relax and rest a spell;  And set your cares aside.   It's time to put those frowns away And let \"Raised Right\" make you smile!\" Y'all enjoy now, y'heah!

Alex Dove, who left remote Wellington Point as a child, returns after college to deal with his deceased parents' failing farm. Merridy Bowman is on leave from university to nurse her dying father, who has moved into a Wellington Point retirement community. The two outsiders forge a relationship (despite the brief but spirited attempt of a townie to win Merridy) and marry, settling on Alex's family farm, where they eke out a modest living. Although the novel's sympathies lie with Alex, it is his ambitious wife who drives the novel. Their struggle to conceive leads to Merridy's unlikely return to her studies and, eventually, to rescuing a mysterious, troubled child from a shipwrecked boat. Trouble, as ever, is in the offing, and when it arrives, Shakespeare allows it to run its natural course without dipping into melodrama. Expertly crafted, the novel illuminates love's craggy depths.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now in his 80s, the author began playing piano in San Francisco at age four, gave his first public recital at eight, debuted with the New York Philharmonic at 16, won the prestigious Queen Elisabeth competition in Brussels in 1952 and made seminal recordings of Brahms and Beethoven with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra in the ’50s and early ’60s. However, his meteoric rise as a world-class musician was abruptly halted in 1964, at age 36, when he lost the use of his fourth and fifth fingers on his right hand. What gives this tale a heroic edge is not just Fleisher’s triumphant return to the performance stage at age 66, but the fact that, during the 30-year interval while he grappled with “two fingers that wanted to make a fist all the time,” he refashioned himself, channeling his gargantuan interpretive gifts into becoming an accomplished conductor, arts administrator and teacher. He also gained renown as a specialist in left-handed repertoire, performing Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand so often and well that Musical Americanamed him 1994 Instrumentalist of the Year, two years before his right hand regained most of its former form. Though Fleisher provides an undoubtedly feel-good account, he also cautions readers. “If my story is about anything, it’s about being very careful when your dreams come true,” he writes...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On 29 April he preached before the Long Parliament. In this sermon, and in his Country Essay for the Practice of Church Government, which he appended to it, his tendency to break away from Presbyterianism to the Independent or Congregational system is seen. Like John Milton, he saw little to choose between \"new presbyter\" and \"old priest.\" He became pastor at Coggeshall in Essex, with a large influx of Flemish tradesmen. In March 1651, Cromwell, as Chancellor of Oxford University, gave him the deanery of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and made him Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in September 1652; in both offices he succeeded the Presbyterian, Edward Reynolds. During his eight years of official Oxford life Owen showed himself a firm disciplinarian, thorough in his methods, though, as John Locke testifies, the Aristotelian traditions in education underwent no change. With Philip Nye he unmasked the popular astrologer, William Lilly, and in spite of his share in condemning two Quakeresses to be whipped for disturbing the peace, his rule was not intolerant.  Anglican services were conducted here and there, and at Christ Church itself the Anglican chaplain remained in the college. While little encouragement was given to a spirit of free inquiry, Puritanism at Oxford was not simply an attempt to force education and culture into \"the leaden moulds of Calvinistic theology.\" Owen, unlike many of his contemporaries, was more interested in the New Testament than in the Old. During his Oxford years he wrote Justitia Divina, an exposition of the dogma that God cannot forgive sin without an atonement; Communion with God, Doctrine of the Saints' Perseverance, his final attack on Arminianism; Vindiciae Evangelicae, a treatise written by order of the Council of State against Socinianism as expounded by John Biddle; On the Mortification of Sin in Believers, an introspective and analytic work; Schism, one of the most readable of all his writings; Of Temptation, an attempt to recall Puritanism to its cardinal spiritual attitude from the jarring anarchy of sectarianism and the pharisaism which had followed on popularity and threatened to destroy the early simplicity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time.

Such invasions of one's personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother's secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually \"better\" he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, \"Writing time is always good time.\" He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B004NNVIC4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Corcoran, one-time editor of Golf Illustrated and author of The PGA TOUR Complete Book of Golf, highlights the stirring battle waged between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus for the 1977 Open (British) Championship in Turnberry, Scotland. The author offers both a succinct history of that tournament, reaching back to the mid-19th century, and a particularly revealing examination of leading participants from the United States. He tells how Arnold Palmer's 1960 quest for the title rekindled the interest of America's top touring pros in the four-day event that most golfers consider the world's most important. Corcoran provides rich analyses of Palmer; Nicklaus, the man who dethroned him; and Watson, who out-dueled the Golden Bear during a magnificent final 36-hole shootout. Even for those who recall the event in detail, this book will prove entertaining and enlightening, with riveting hole-by-hole accounts, evocative depictions of the weather, course conditions, and emotions besetting the golfers. Included are telling portraits of other noteworthy linksmen from the era. Highly recommended. Robert C.

Nowhere is this more necessary than in understanding Chinese media today. Some aspects of it are more open and flexible than ever; others have become even more rigidly controlled.

As pressure to find the celestial needle in a haystack mounts, Webb becomes convinced that the secret to locating the asteroid lies in a manuscript written by a little-known Italian astronomer more than 400 years ago—a manuscript already procured by a murderous adversary. Meticulously researched—especially sobering are descriptions of the destruction an asteroid strike would wreak on humanity—Napier has delivered a thought-provoking and speculative novel, with plenty of twists to keep the pages turning. Fans of Michael Crichton will find a kindred spirit in Napier.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After kicking her lover out of her life and checking her mother into a detox center, Mary agrees to dance with Mel in the Ohio Star Ball, a major competition. Meanwhile in Seattle and New Orleans, women dancers resembling Mary are murdered. Rene Verlane, the husband of the New Orleans victim, insists the crime is related to his wife's dancing. Mary follows the case on TV and one night calls Verlane to offer her help in finding the killer. Together this long-distance team hunts down the killer who is stalking female dancers.

His vast body of work includes altarpieces and religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known prints include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Dürer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She left the inland city for Durban where she obtained a degree in Environmental Health. However, work opportunities took her in a slightly different direction, and she was employed by the Keep Pietermaritzburg Clean Association for eight years. Her role was to educate the public in waste management and recycling, and with the purpose of reaching the public on a wide scale, was challenged to make a \"not-terribly exciting subject for most people\" interesting and informative through regular features in the regional newspapers, \"The Witness\" and \"Echo\". The subject turned out to be often controversial, and to her great surprise, a small following of regular readers developed. \"I discovered that I absolutely loved writing. I had never considered a writing life before and so I thought that if I could get readers interested in waste issues, then perhaps I could try my hand at writing something infinitely more entertaining.\" Cheriê now lives with her husband Andrew and three children in New Zealand. \"We moved here partly for the adventure and partly for the opportunities that our children now have. But South Africa is still irrevocably part of our souls, and perhaps one day we will return for more than just a visit.\" \"Through the Dust\" is her debut novel, set in Southern Africa and inspired by her and her husband's ancestral history. Cheriê is currently working on her second novel on an entirely different subject, the ancient ruins of Great Zimbabwe. \"Though there is no archeological evidence on site to support the theory, there is a tantalising record written by an Arab trader in around 100AD, of the existence of ruins inland from modern-day Mozambique.\" Cheriê hopes to complete the novel by the end of 2013.", "related": [], "rank": 2179267, "title": "Through the Dust", "author": "Cheriê Pascoe", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From his first chapter, I was  engaged with the life story of his very well developed character Yodit,  her struggles paralleling the insurrection years of war, the rise of the  Socialist Party, and the starving millions of Ethiopians, as the world  seemingly looked the other way.I felt Yodit’s struggle to get an  education, her falling love, then the revelation on her marriage night  that she had been a victim of female circumcision. It was then she  decided that her Doctoral Thesis would center on this very wide spread  brutality on third world women.The book held my interest from start  to finish. It then concludes with a beautiful poem by the Author giving  yet another picture of the land and the people. Yodit’s story would  make a very good human interest movie to introduce the strong people and  the beautiful land of Ethiopia.by: G.R.

The tale unfolds through the dual reminiscences of Ruth Becker, an elderly resident of Sydney in 2001, and Ernst Toller, eminent playwright and former leader of the short-lived Bavarian Republic. Both belonged to a group of left-wing German activists who were forced into exile in London after Hitler came to power, and who risked everything to alert the world—especially Britain, whose deliberate blindness grows increasingly infuriating in the novel—to the danger the Nazis posed. Settled into New York’s Mayflower Hotel in 1939, Toller reworks his autobiography to make the woman who was its emotional heart live once again. Dora Fabian was Ruth’s cousin and Toller’s lover, and the passionate intensity that defines her political and personal existence blazes through these pages. The moral dilemmas affecting Funder’s characters, all based on historical figures, are as strongly evoked as the repressive environment they inhabit and are brave enough to stand against. --Sarah Johnson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author's careful background explorations of the setting, medical customs of the late 1800s, and those institutions finally being opened to women, make for intriguing plots for the memorable character of Cheney.

He was on the staff of The Economist for four years, and then worked for fourteen years for the London News Chronicle as reporter, leader writer and foreign correspondent. He was assigned to Moscow from 1942 to 1945, where he was also the correspondent of the BBC's Overseas Service. After the war he turned to full-time writing of detective and adventure novels and produced more than forty-five books. His work was serialized, televised, broadcast, filmed and translated into some twenty languages. He is noted for his varied and unusual backgrounds -- which have included Russia, newspaper offices, the West Indies, ocean sailing, the Australian outback, politics, mountaineering and forestry -- and for never repeating a plot.

But Savage Publishing, the publishing company that owns the newspaper, has told her to stop writing editorials in favor of womens' rights.  Libby firmly believes in the suffrage movement and has no intentions of stopping.  But when Andrew Savage, the youngest of the Savage clan, shows up on her doorstep she is determined to convince him to let her run the newspaper her way.  William Donovan is only in Laramie, Wyoming to collect on a debt from a very dead Andrew Savage.  When Libby mistakenly assumes he is Andrew Savage, he goes along with the charade fully intending to tell her the truth before he leaves town.  But he doesn't tell her and finds himself on a train bound for San Francisco with the persistent Miss Justice.  She makes him promise to take her to Savage Publishing so she can talk to his father R.T. Savage.  Donovan doesn't know what he's gotten himself into, but he feels responsible for Libby.  When Libby finds out that Donovan isn't a member of the Savage family, she is furious with him.  But without any money, she agrees to stay at his house while she waits for a chance to see R.T. Savage.  When Donovan goes to plead her case to R.T. Savage himself, he gets more from the visit than he bargained for!  Suddenly, his life is turned upside down and he must deal with the fact that he may have to make some very difficult personal decisions in the near future that will effect not only himself, but the woman he has come to care deeply for.  R.T.  and Libby clash from the beginning.  Donovan is also in for a few surprises from R.T., and even finds himself siding with the man.  R.T. has a good reason for not supporting the suffrage movement and Libby refuses to back down, even if it means losing  Donovan.   Though he says he's not the marrying kind,  something about Libby touches Donovan in a way that no other woman has.  But what sacrifices will he be willing to make to be with her?Sharon Ihle is a marvelous author!  Her writing just keeps getting better and better! Once again, Ms. Ihle dazzles us with her wonderful characters!  The Marrying Kind is a joy to read! Take one feisty heroine, a charming hero, some witty humor and a lot of romance and the end result will be a book by Sharon Ihle!Kristina Wright  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

The bits of advice include: Attach labels to Little Slug s favorite things, Read out loud to him, Point out words that repeat, Sound out words, Make a vocabulary list, and Be patient. Everything is made amusing by adding the slug perspective ( underline favorite words in slug slime ). Presented in a combination of bold text and speech bubbles, Pearson s text is simple and appealing. Illustrations are cartoonish with plenty of bug appeal, humor, and a scintilla of grossness. Beyond its cleverness, this is a terrific bookfomercial for READING. The final pages share some of the joys to be found in books in an unpreachy way. And that is no small achievement. --School Library Journal, May, 2011Gr K-3 Pearson is a slug intimate, having previously charted the course of two Slugs in Love (illustrated by Kevin O'Malley, 2006), so who better to explain, exactly, the best way to teach a slug to read? It is really quite elementary, starting with opening the book (make sure it has slug characters), read it to the slug, point out repeating words, help sound them out, get a vocabulary list going, underline favorite words and, you bet, [r]ead your slug s favorite poems to him as many times as he wants. Read him other books too! This slug s favorite is Mother Slug s book of poetry, with such old gems as Mary had a little slug, / His skin was smooth as silk and Whatever can the matter be? / Sally Slug has climbed a tree and Sweet Sammy Slug / Slides through the town. Slonim s upbeat illustrations give readers a sense that they are there with the slugs, flipping the pages, while the interjections from the slugs Sl-uh-uh-g! Hey, I can read SLUG! convey, with a light hand, the joys of reading. And though it isn t cricket to diminish a slug s capabilities, readers can t help but feel that if a slug is up to the task, well then, maybe someone else in the room is, too. --Kirkus January 15, 2011", "related": ["B0079L1BJM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How the Camel Got His Hump is narrated by Jack Nicholson, whose gravely voice perfectly captures Kipling's dry wit. One major problem with this recording is the abundance of long musical interludes that interfer with the smooth reading of the story. The colored-pencil illustrations are similar to Quentin Blake's marvelous line and wash cartoons for How the Camel Got His Hump (Bedrick, 1985), but are in a more polished format. Raglin's cartoonlike characters have expressive faces, and he utilizes the desert colors effectively. The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher is narrated by Meryl Streep. Although the music tends to overwhelm the narrator, and occasionally Streep's acting gets in the way of the words, this is a quality recording that follows the text exactly. The colored-pencil illustrations have a wonderful texture and are excuted in appropriately watery blues, greens, and yellows. For those who aren't Potter purists, these illustrations are quite engaging and much larger in scale, so they can be used in a group reading. There are many wonderful editions of both of these stories available, but these will be popular in any children's collection. --Karen K.

Families have to look for\nways to save money and buy groceries. Because catfish are readily available in\nalmost every lake, river, creek, pond or any-other body of water, catfishing\nprovides fun and inexpensive recreational time for fishermen and their\nfamilies. Too, by catching catfish and eating them, you really can save on your\ngrocery bill. Question: In some areas, catfish have an off-flavor,\nand some catfish taste very fishy. How do you solve that problem with the\ncatfish you eat?Phillips: I used to catch catfish in backwater\nsloughs and swamp holes in the Tombigbee River swamps in west/central Alabama\nnear my family's hunting club and the University of West Alabama where I\ngraduated. Because these dead-looking lakes and ponds contained so much leaf\ndebris on their bottoms, and many of these leaves were from oak trees, the\nwater had a tannic color, and the fish had a tannic-acid taste. Here's the\ntrick to eating any type of off-flavored fish: Cut the fish fillets\n     into 1-inch chunks, and put the chunks in an ice chest. Cover the chunks\n     with 7Up, Sprite or any-other type of lemon-lime soda.Pour a big bag of ice on\n     top of the soda, so that you have a 2- or 3-inch layer of ice. Within 3 or 4 hours, the lemon-lime soda will pull the\noff-flavor out of the catfish chunks and replace it with a sweet taste. If I\nhave really-strong-tasting catfish or very-large catfish, I may let the chunks\nsit in this mixture overnight. Wash the chunks off, and keep them in ice water\nuntil you batter and fry them. All the off-flavor will be gone.", "related": ["B006WO3F0U"], "rank": 1344950, "title": "Catfish Like a Pro eBook", "author": "John E.

His teachings were noted down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses. Philosophy, Epictetus taught, is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are determined by fate, and are thus beyond our control, but we can accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. Individuals, however, are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable, or from neglecting what is within our power.

But you can't help but\ncheer her on as she chooses to take them on after they kill her\ngrandfather and brother and abduct her mother (and all of the other\nwomen in their group). Annie's bravery is astounding, and my heart\nabsolutely broke for her as she dealt with so many losses but kept\nmoving forward.

She makes some rash\ndecisions and doesn't carefully think through every plan, and the way\nshe \"infiltrates\" the bad guy's stronghold was something that didn't\nwork for me at all.

Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'.

I live outside of Tampa, Florida with my fabulous wife Anita, and one remaining son at home, Montana. I have three older boys, Mark, Gary, and Anthony, all of whom have married and presented us with terrific grandchildren. I read hundreds of books by the science fiction greats growing up, and thousands of fair to not so greats in dual novel paperbacks and magazines. My education gravitated to science, starting out as a physics major and my depression era folks told me I'd never make a living as a theoretical physicist (probably right, and Cosmology wasn't a career field then), so I moved to Electronics Engineering. I did most of that in the aerospace field for MacDonnell Douglas Corp, in St. Louis, Mo. I worked on the F4 Phantom project, and briefly on Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), before the fickle fates of government finance forced contract cancelations. I devoted (read: I was drafted into) two years' service for the US Army from 1965 to 1967. A great two years, and the Army, caring not a whit for my electronics background, offered this draftee a job as an Air Traffic Controller. Cool! After discharge I spent a short time back at MacDonnell Douglas before the contract reductions laid me off, and was hired by Emerson Electric (1968), working on the design of a neat heads-up fire control system for the Army's new Cheyenne Helicopter (to be a 270-knot hybrid fixed wing/rotor craft). Never heard of it? The fickle fates of Army finance is why this time, plus Lockheed didn't keep the airframe part from crashing and burning at a crucial point in development. I taught Electronics for about eighteen months (near starvation wages after the high pay), and finally decided to try my hand at actually supporting my family again. I hired on with the Federal Aviation Administration as an Air Traffic Controller in 1970. Thanks Army! I spent exactly forty years in federal service, deciding in 1979 to use my technical background to work on writing features for the software of the FAA's Terminal Automation Systems (for 28 of those 40 years). Retired, I now work as a consultant/contractor for the FAA, supporting a software feature I helped create. I finally decided to try my hand at writing what I love to read, Science Fiction. My Koban series is doing very well. I hope you enjoy the books.

He left behind no story arcs, no further plot ideas or concepts of where to go next. He'd created a single novella and the concept for a series, but not a series itself.    A decade later, I was commissioned to expand the novella into a full-sized book and then create nine more books, thus turning Smith's idea into what became known as the \"Family d'Aloembert series.\" I'd read and enjoyed Smith's earlier Skylark and Lensman series, so I was eagerly anticipating this assignment.    Unfortunately, it was not all I'd hoed for. The novella certainly had action aplenty, but the writing, the universe and the characters left much to be desired. The text used bizarre words like \"ultratoilsomely.\" The characters were two-dimensional and way too goody-goody even for the 1960s, let alone the 70s or later. The history and development of the universe were painfully naive, with an anti-communhist screed straight out of the McCarthy era of the 50s. And while Smith was noted for the excellence of his villains, the ultimate bad guy here never once set foot onstage. Clearly this work needed a lot of rehabilitation.    Having to stick closely to Smith's creation hampered me considerably, but I did as much as I could to make the characters and universe more believable, and I tried to come up with stories that were exciting enough to please Smith's legion of fans. I got letters of praise that told me I was succeeding, which was most gratifying.    Still, as decades passed, the initially creaky concept grew more and more outdated. Finally, in the mid-2000s, I decided to update the series. I tossed out \"Imperial Stars\" in its entirety; instead, I wrote an entirely new first novel to introduce the universe and the characters, and I made major modifications to the remaining 9 books to fit the new beginning. The result is what I now call the Agents of ISIS series, something I feel is more appropriate for the 21st century.   The Omicron Invasionis book 9 of the classic series, superseded byOutworld Invadersof my Agents of ISIS. Whichever series you choose to read, I hope you enjoy it.--Stephen Goldin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a teenager, she had several short stories published in literary magazines.  She completed writing her first novel at the age of 17.   Hadena graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in European History with minors in German and Russian studies.  She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena’s primary literary genre is action/thriller.  She currently writes two series, both use action/thriller.  “The Brenna Strachan Series” uses fantasy and the “Dreams & Reality Series” uses murder mystery as its secondary genre.  She continues to explore and expand her writing and hopes to soon produce a comedic action/thriller.  When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader,  reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.  One of her all-time favorite books is “Good Omens” by Neil Gaimen and Terry Pratchett.  She writes all of her books while listening to music and the bands tend to get “honorable mentions” within the pages. http://www.facebook.com/hadenajames hadenajames.wordpress.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

Hauled in to the Green Hills courthouse on a speeding violation, Marshall is appointed by the presiding judge to represent the murder suspect in his arraignment. But what should have been a five-minute pro forma exercise takes on life-changing importance as Marshall, convinced that justice is being ill-served in the case, uncovers another murder and turns up a big-city number of small-town secrets. In swiftly moving prose and with an affectionately rendered, credible cast, Brandon (Loose Among the Lambs) delivers a solid string of riveting, detailed courtroom dramas?and some moving bedroom scenes as well. A few holes in the plot and an obvious red herring do little to impede the pleasures of time spent in the company of Marshall and the Green Hills' citizenry.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The characters are well\ndeveloped, and my hatred for the villain in the book felt genuine as if he were\na real person.I recommend \"Brother\" by Jim Murray to anyone\nlooking for an intense thriller. Just be sure to plan on not putting the book\ndown once you start it!Christine Watson. Reader Views. Brotheris a\nstory of revenge. A good one. It tells the tale of two brothers, Dominic and\nSpencer, who have been battling each other on some level for their entire\nlives.Murray is a master storyteller. Brother is a complex,\nfascinating and fast-paced story filled with well-developed, interesting\ncharacters. He skilfully weaves Dominic's memories of his difficult childhood -\nfrom what he saw at Spencer's unwelcome, family-shattering birth to the mental\nillness that seems to run in his family - and the events of their current-day\nlives with a deft hand. He explores tenuous family relationships that have been\ndamaged by lifelong grudges, imagined slights and not-so-hidden resentments -\nand how they might actually be healed.Rebecca\nParsons. Portland Book Review. The book[Brother]covers the life of Dominic and his relationship with his younger brother,\nSpencer, and to\na lesser degree their parents, girlfriends and friends. There is love, betrayal, hatred, and even a little violence.\nIt is very psychological and will keep you reading until the end.San Francisco Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 92.0}

As a younger son, with wealth, but no attachments, he can afford to please himself and take another dangerous assignment. He must break into a gang that preys upon the upper levels of society--break in from the bottom. He stations himself as a street sweeper on the fashionable block where the gang will strike next, hoping to discover one of the gang members. His break comes when a footman chases a thief from one of the houses. As the man flees, he knocks a young lady into the street and the path of a carriage! Hugh rescues the lady and loses his quarry. Lady Rebecca Westcott is like no one he's ever encountered before. As a reward for saving her life, she convinces her family to give him employment. Her kindness and concern are genuine, and Hugh soon finds himself fighting the tender feelings he has for her. The web grows more tangled as he comes to the attention of the gang and is forced to steal from his benefactress to prove his good faith! Hugh is determined to keep a distance from Lady Rebecca, who, despite their apparent difference in stations, seems equally determined to prevent that from happening! The Reluctant Thief is the fourth book in the Westcott series, the Earl of Westcott having five daughters! Nor is this the first time a gentleman has posed as a servant in the Westcott household. April Kihlstrom uses that fact to ease the reactions of Rebecca's family to her apparent infatuation with a servant. However, she stretches believability when they are caught more than once alone together and Hugh isn't fired. The dialogue is sharp and the characters are well matched. And of course, there's one daughter to go!   The Reluctant Thief will steal your time and attention from everything else once you pick it up! Beware the thief! Once you meet Hugh Rowland, you'll want to take him home as well! Lady Rebecca is a worthy heir to the Westcott sister ingenuity and flair!  Linda Fitzner  --Copyright © 1998 Literary Times, Inc.

The story ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life.In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition.Over the years her love of storytelling and curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa has also worked as a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and has given workshops to writers' groups in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada.Vanessa and her husband live on Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest with their two Australian Shepherd dogs.", "related": [], "rank": 725210, "title": "Lifelines: Kate's Story", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 39.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

Although you will find Maggie and\nWinn as well, this is more of a story of what is happening around them.\nEvents are put into motion that will shape the future for all those in\nthe Norse village and both Benjamin and Makedewa are smack down in the\nmiddle of it.I came up with the idea after running across a snippet in my own\nfamily history. As I\nresearched I kept wondering about what happenedbeyondthe facts.\n What was it like to live during that time, and what did it feel like to\n be a woman then? Soon an even more intriguing\nquestion occurred: If a modern woman somehow went back in time, would\nshe be able to survive during such a tumultuous time in history?So\n it happened that the idea for this story grew wings. Maggie is a modern\n day woman with all her flaws and features, thrust back into a time\nwhere men were carving out the history of America. She has just enough\nknowledge of the past to know trouble is coming, yet soon she is kicking\n herself for not paying better attention in history class.

Strategy takes priority; strategy determines tactics. As the title indicates, this is a book on mission strategy--and a very good one. Moreover, it is not simply a book on this or that phase of mission; it lays out a strategy for fulfilling Great Commission mission. I commend it to the reading, study, and practice of missionaries and mission students, pastors and staff members, and all Christians who take the Great Commission seriously.\"--David J. Hesselgrave, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; cofounder, Evangelical Missiological Society\"Some people are theoreticians, while others are practitioners. Some think, others do. In this remarkable piece, we see a unique blend of both. The authors are thinking-doers, much like our missiological predecessor the apostle Paul, and their work here is strategically important. Anyone of any generation interested in seeing local churches and mission movements advance for Christ's sake should read this book and apply its insights.\"--Keith Eitel, Roy Fish School of Evangelism and Missions, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\"John Mark Terry and J. D. Payne demonstrate how to develop strategies to reach people groups for Christ by first providing a historic panorama of the last two thousand years of missions strategy before moving to practical guidelines for strategizing in contemporary contexts. This stimulating project provides a comprehensive work of case studies and procedures for serving God in both the majority world and the West.\"--Robert L.

I currently live in Hampstead with my wife Meredith, and our 3 little boys. I have always enjoyed reading and writing. I am not a big reader of fiction, though if it is a good story, I will be hooked. A couple of authors I really enjoy these days are Mitch Albom and David Gregory. Albom is the author of \"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" and \"Tuesdays With Morrie\". He has also written another book called \"For One More Day\" that I have not yet read. Gregory is the writer of \"Dinner with a Perfect Stranger\" and \"A Day With a Perfect Stranger\". You may also find me reading the short stories of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. If I could model myself after one author, I think I would have to choose C.S. Lewis. He was such an artist with words, and had an excellent knowledge of the human condition. Most of my time however is spent reading the great theologians and Christians of the past such as Augustine, Calvin, Luther, Edwards, Bunyan, and Spurgeon amongst others. I have recently become very interested in Philosophy as well, and really enjoy Francis Schaeffer and how he intertwines the study of Theology and Philosophy. I also love to read John Piper. His passion for God is tremendously contagious. I have never envisioned myself as a fiction writer, but as a non-fiction, expositional writer. One day however God gave me the idea for my first book \"Testimony\". I think it is a great story that needs to be told and can help many who may be in a situation similar to the one I was in, and similar to the one the main character, Paul is in. We all have questions about faith, and who God is. \"Testimony\" is a partially autobiographical tale about how God uses ALL of our circumstances in life to reveal who He is to His children.

When she can talk her husband into it, they enjoy going for road trips, looking for the elusive town of New Hope. In between road trips and gardening, she manages to fit in an internet radio talk show called the Dawn of Shades, interviewing a variety of people, including other authors, and promoting causes dear to her heart.

What were once muffin bake-ware plot lines, filled with a variety of mushy, over-emotional same ol' - same ol', have now become intriguing mixtures of thrillers, science fiction, historical and supernatural tales; the icing on a romance storyline or novel.      3 Days in Paradise is an excellent example of this genre mixing. It is a short, but exceptionally well delivered story of supernatural events influencing real life while delivering a message about what might lie beyond. Real characters fill this story along with smart dialogue and tight narrative. Chameleon is expert at holding her cards close while stringing out the suspense; so much so, that you simply can't put the book down. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys short, intriguing stories that provide not only entertainment, but also a reason to pause and consider life's many potentialities. -Reviewed by Lex Allen for Reader's Favorite", "related": ["B00J4BWKI6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.15, "rating_total": 83.0}

A busy work schedule currently excludes partners, pets and children, but I hope, eventually, to enjoy all three.I have been writing short stories for as long as I can remember. Over the last ten years, erotic fiction has gradually seduced and dominated my creativity. We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": [], "rank": 2662013, "title": "Whatever happened to my teacher?", "author": "Alexandra Amalova", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During this time, Gregory was approached by art magazines to write short articles and educational columns pertaining to ceramic artistry. Captivating readers by his writing style grew fast, which instigated his desire to express himself further. From there, it began.

She currently lives in the nation’s capital with her partner of 7 years and two super adorable cats - all three are incredibly sweet rescues. Just kidding. One of the cats is an asshole.

Christopher J Cooper's book Through My Windows (The History Behind Holy Hip Hop). In my opinion is a MUST read for all in our HHH community. Please all Emcee's GET THIS BOOK and learn your history! Big Shouts to you Sup, I loved your book brah! --Fred Lynch /P.I.DI just got you're through my windows book in the mail, yesterday.. I just finished reading the entire book this morning... man, my i say it was a great read... I put this up their with some of the great books i have read, like also A.C. Green \"Victory\" back in the days... I got saved in 1998, i was 13.. I have been a fan of you'res since 1999.. I started drawing in 1999... Keep doin you're thing for Christ and never stop! blessings, PSWIF 1 --Patrick Sargent\"I started rapping about God because I didn't enjoy choir music. Moreover, because my new lifestyle didn't agree with the character attributes Hip Hop embraced...I was offended by the attacks [from Christians against the use of Hip Hop to express the Gospel], but happy that it happened at the same time. Out of that experience came purpose and meaning. I now understood why I needed Gospel rap.\" Soup The Chemist, p45, \"Through My Windows: The History Behind Holy Hip Hop\". I could have written those lines myself. A Caribbean woman, whose favorite music was Reggae, yet whose life was partially changed by the music of an American Hip Hop head, and the Author of those words. In 1998 I first encountered the fledgling art of Christian Hip Hop, or Holy Hip Hop as it was then labelled. Among the very few Emcees who stood out as talented to grip a mic - Super C, aka Sup The Chemist, aka Soup The Chemist of SFC (Soldiers For Christ) fame. The Christian market in the Hip Hop industry was pitiful, and barely in existence in the 90's. Yet it was their rap-voices which stood out and appealed to me, as God spoke to me through their boldness and tenacity to rep Christ, against the backdrop of a musical world that mocked their endeavors. Their struggle would became a mirror of my faith walk. Fast forward 15+ years later, and I have the pleasure of watching, and listening to the Christian Hip Hop market expanded in a way that was not possible for Soup The Chemist, and many others back then. Why? Because they were the ones, digging up a foundation, laying down the path, and wiring the electrics to power up this thing we have known as Holy Hip Hop. Being personally affected by Soup's music, and an avid historical follower of this growing musical market of Christian Hip Hop, I was excited when Soup tweeted about publishing his autobiographical book. For me, this was a chance to read some personal history from an Emcee who, in some circles, is now hailed as the \"Godfather of Holy Hip Hop. And Through My Windows delivered that, and more. This book, which turned out to be a hodgepodge of musical history, personal faith walk, personal pain, personal triumph, and just plain faith, and life talk, was an easeful read, in the plain, and unconvoluted voice of an unpretentious man, whose music is famed for lyrical genius, that can go above the head of the average bubblegum music listener. Soup surprised me with his candor about his ex-wife, his \"backsliding\", his admitted failures to live Christ in some of his personal and professional relationships. I smiled, laughed, cried, and felt hurt for the young man who endured ridicule in and out the church, who slept cramped, knee-to-knee, in a jalopy of a van to tour the country with a form of Gospel music, which could not keep him fed; who lost his wife, a brother, and friends along the way, but got up on a mic to spread the Gospel of Christ. By the end of the book, I was not ready to let go of his last, almost-upsetting words, but by it's final letter, I sure understood, with a nod, what Soup meant earlier, when he said: \"No, I didn't make a bunch of money. No, we didn't sleep in five-star hotels, or ride around in a plush tour bus. But the lives we touched and the way we saw the spirit of God move around us was priceless. There's no way we would have experienced Providence the way we had if we had been doing it big like superstars; so I thank God for the hard times. Those trials enabled us to see Him work in our lives for ourselves; instead of just hearing about how He can from people in church.\" - Soup The Chemist, p55, \"Through My Windows: The History Behind Holy Hip Hop\". --- Kalinago WoryiI really did enjoy reading. Couldn't put it down once I started and finished reading last week. A real eye opener. You have blessed more people in places (outside of the US) you probably can't even imagine. My first copy of your work was \"A saved man in the jungle\". What I got off my buddy back in '91 was a 'dubbed' cassette with no track listing, no album title, no artiste name…. nothing! All I knew was it was real Godly music, relevant and hardcore at the same time!!!

My favorite ones are historical. England and Scotland have always fascinated me. I was born Scot-Irish and English so it is only natural I would be interested in my ancestors. I especially like reading the love stories of the aristocracy. I always liked the way people of the Regency and Victorian era lived so that is where I have decided to base my stories. I was born in South Carolina and grew up in Florida. I have always been able to lay in bed at night and dream up stories so I decided I would start writing some of them down. I hope you enjoy my stories as much as I have enjoyed writing them. I sat down Sunday after the release of my latest book on Amazon and started telling my daughter some of the story of Buck Jill and witches goddesses and werewolves. The whole time I was telling the story my wife and daughter were staring at me. When I finished my daughter asked, \"How do you come up with all this stuff. My granddaughter chimed in and asked me to tell another story. I don't know where these stories come from. They just come out. When I was a kid I didn't have any friends close by to play with so I made up my own games. I was always the hero cowboy. With my trusty broom handle between my legs I would run across the yard chasing the bad guys. It usually ended in a fight when I caught the bad guy. Sometime I would be a super hero and chase bad guys with my cape tied around my neck(bath towel) and my bathing suit on. I made a crate into a space ship and tried to get my brother to pick me up in it and throw it to the moon. I always thought of him as the strongest man in the world. And my daughter wonders where I get these stories from.", "related": [], "rank": 2878352, "title": "Witches of the Swamp", "author": "William Roach", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After all, the ultimate test of a man’s worth is what his new partner’s pets think of him… Cats aside, Amy enjoys writing about intelligent female characters who know themselves and their desires. She’s been fascinated by sex, relationship and power-play dynamics for many years, and experiments with different sub-genres under the overarching category of BDSM, concentrating on Domination and submission romance in particular. She also writes vanilla lesbian erotica (without the romance!) under the pseudonym of Sidonie Spice.", "related": ["B00KFP9EPW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.3, "rating_total": 43.0}

There's also a paucity of deep motivation: the characters are as thin as the paper they appear on. FBI agent Karen Younger is sent to a Southern California college town where two young women have been murdered and mutilated in the manner of a woman whose death Karen investigated in Germany eight years earlier. As Karen works with the local cops, it's revealed that the killer is AWOL army \"lifer\" Ralph Beringer, out to inflict vengeance upon the world and his ex-wife, who left him years ago in response to his brutality. Glenda (\"Lennie\") Beringer divorced Ralph, took their toddler son across the country and eventually married film instructor David Lindstrom, with whom she's had a daughter. The climax, which brings together the killer, the cop and the family, is brutal yet predictably pat?though not nearly as pat as the killer's choice of victims: a Lisl, an Edith, a Natalie, a Nan.... When Karen wonders if the killer is picking his prey by name, her putative boyfriend says, \"That's too goofy.\" Indeed.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story makes the reader imagine how it is\nto live in such a dire situation. Vivid, fast paced and with\nwell-rounded characters, it is easy to imagine the breakdown of\ncivilization. Indeed, this novel can make you ask yourself what you will\n do if you are in the same situation. And it is chilling to realize that\n something like this can actually happen to our planet. Great read!\" - 5/5 Stars - Maria Beltran for Readers' Favorite\"Tight, taut writing and meaningful characters make this novel a good read for those interested in the post-apocalyptic genre.Upon reading The End, I felt a strong desire to write the author and tell him to create more stories about Mick as well as his allies as they struggle to carve out an existence in such a hostile world.\" - 4/5 Stars - Eduardo Aduna for Readers' Favorite\"Simply put, this is an intelligent book that deftly revolves around humanity with flawless prose that keeps one reading. With substantially well-developed characters, it is not difficult to truly identify with each of them. I will certainly be looking forward to read more from Mr. Sullivan.\" - 5/5 Stars - Lit Amri for Readers' Favorite\"The author's mix of characters, the good guys and the bad,\n was accomplished very well and the dialogue was first-rate.
