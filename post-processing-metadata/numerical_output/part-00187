Begun in the 1950s by young, Harlem-born Holcombe Rucker, the tournaments included some of basketball's great games throughout the decades. Here, such pros as Julius Erving, Wilt Chamberlain and, more recently, Kobe Bryant pounded the asphalt with local unknowns. Mallozzi, who grew up and played basketball nearby in the 1970s and 80s, has covered the tournament since 1986: \"nowhere else could I find the kind of basketball that was being played at Rucker Park, where legends, nicknames, and great rivalries are born every summer.\" While he celebrates the tournament's past glory (Rucker died of cancer in 1965 at the age of 38), he doesn't shy away from its sometimes controversial moments (many people think it's become simply a hip-hop show and shoe ad, where the game is hardly taken seriously). Mallozzi lends an even hand to this fast-paced tale.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Reagan's absence is due to his illness; the obvious omission of Clinton is never explained.) Avoiding talk of policy and politics, Greene delves into the safe minutiae of presidential lives: he peppers the fraternity with inane queries about exercise routines (\"Is the Secret Service around when you do your sit-ups?\"), wardrobe, favorite songs and movies (Ford's isMrs. Doubtfire), the novelty of sleeping in the White House and wounded feelings over partisan name-calling. Above all, he goggles at their unfathomable fall from exalted supercelebrity to approachable semicelebrity. \"Can you just go into a clothing store?\" Greene demands of Ford. \"What about that whole thing of going into the changing room?\" Greene's few wrestlings with the meaning of the office (\"It's like you're president of every town,\" he blurts to a preternaturally patient Bush) can verge on the inchoate. Carter, with a more substantial postpresidential public life than the others, receives the most substantial profile as a serious, tight-lipped micro-manager.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The day Jasmine St. Clair realized her biggest dream, she experienced both.That day, from sunrise till sunset it rained, making the August day in Los Angeles abnormally cool. The wet weather hadn't bothered her at first, not like it usually did. Jasmine had been in a giddy state of elation, the rush of delicious emotions so strong as she anticipated the coming evening that she'd hardly noticed the summer shower. Hours before the hairstylist and makeup artist arrived—two of the best in the business—her mind had danced with thoughts of how extraordinarily beautiful she would look at the gala event, how incredible she would feel. But when by late afternoon the sky grew darker and more bleak with heavier rain, Jasmine took notice, her excitement quickly fading. Instantly her skin prickled as she felt the familiar chill take hold of the base of her neck, slowly creeping across her shoulder blades and down her spine. But before it could totally overpower her and take her to that dark, cold place, she fought the chill with three shots of brandy and thoughts of her mother. Her mother believed that rain was a blessing. Despite the fact that it rained the day her younger brother had been killed in a senseless hit-and-run incident and didn't stop raining until after his funeral, her mother still believed that. Today, the most important day of her life thus far, Jasmine needed to believe it, too.But if Jasmine had been looking for a sign that her success would be short-lived, the rain should have been it. With the rain normally came an inexplicable feeling of cold so deep inside nothing could warm her. The cold could last for hours or even days, until something ultimately went wrong in her life. Something major, like when her brother died. Or something minor, like when her fingernail caught in her car door and completely tore off.Jasmine had moved from Florida to California to escape frequent showers, and today she refused to see the weather as a bad omen. Today, sheknew,was different. Not even the unexpected downpour could dampen her sweet mood.This was why, as she followed her boyfriend into the lavishly decorated penthouse suite later that evening, a glass of champagne already in hand, Jasmine felt a rush of excitement. Like a woman thrown into a time warp she was in awe, examining everything around her with the interest of someone seeing it for the first time. Her eyes surveyed the mahogany-hardwood floor partially covered by a giant Persian rug, the gold and crystal chandelier in the center of the room, the textured cream-and-rosecolored wallpaper, the French Provincial furniture and Victorian era paintings. It was all so incredible. And it was all, for one night, hers.Jasmine's cell phone vibrated in her palm. She glanced at the screen and saw her agent's number, and decided to ignore it. She wanted nothing to interrupt her emotional high, not even another congratulatory call from the woman who'd booked her the audition that had landed her this major film role.As Jasmine continued walking into the suite, she was aware of sounds around her, but they were drowned out by the intense pounding of her heart. Mesmerized, she took tentative steps toward the floorto-ceiling window, placing her fingertips on the cool glass as she scanned the wide expanse of the city. Rain trickled down the glass like teardrops. She traced the path of one raindrop, suddenly wondering if it was a tear of joy or sadness.It's just rain,she thought, quickly halting the direction of her thoughts. It wasn't a blessing or a curse; it was just an evening shower.That decided, Jasmine saw past the rain, enjoying the view of the city below. Had she ever been this high before? Thirty-five stories up, the world below seemed abstract, like a different planet. An infinitely friendlier, more attractive place. Certainly not the Los Angeles she knew, where people smiled to your face while they stabbed you in the chest. This world seemed like one she could control, like her own personal playground.And in the night, the glittering streetlights below looked like a carpet of stars. Stars laid out just for her.The corners of her lips twitched, wanting to smile, and as Jasmine splayed her free hand on the window, she finally released the scream she'd held inside for hours. The carpet of starswasfor her—to walk on, sit on, roll around on. Because tonight, this high in the sky, she was literally on top of the world. She had made it! Conquered the dream she'd once believed  else's. She was the queen of the universe.Downing a liberal gulp of champagne, Jasmine smiled, laughter bubbling from her throat like the tiny bubbles floating to the surface of the champagne. God, this feeling of success was so incredible she could savor it for days and days. She'd done it— she had reached a point in her career where she could go nowhere but up. The options were boundless now, as limitless as the stars in the sky. She had dreamed of this day since she was a child, had practiced the appreciative wave for her fans, had strutted the seductive, actress walk. She even had her Oscar award-winning speech memorized. Though tonight she hadn't needed it, she knew one day she would.Her life was as wonderful as she'd always known it could be. It had taken thirty-one years, but finally she had achieved her ultimate goal.She was now a verified movie star.Jasmine, what a fabulous performance! You are destined for super stardom!Ms. St. Clair, please, your autograph?Jasmine, over here. Just one quick picture…The lights had flashed around her all night; the buzz had surrounded her wherever she walked; she had been the center of attention, sometimes so crowded by fans and industry people that she hadn't been able to move. But she hadn't minded. It was her life's ambition to be surrounded with love, to knowSome people craved money, and yes, money came with a successful acting career, but that wasn't what it was about for Jasmine. She just wanted to know that she would never go back to that lonely place. And now, she wouldn't. That lonely place of her childhood was finally locked away, forever hidden in a dark corner of her past.Glancing heavenward, she wondered what her brother would think of her now, of how far she had come. Her gaze fixing on a star brighter than the rest, Jasmine imagined that it was her brother, Rickey's, star, that he was smiling down at her, happy that she'd finally gotten out of life what she wanted. When he was alive, she had been happy. Her whole family had been. But after his death, her parents had become so lost in their despair that life in the St. Clair household had changed drastically and permanently. Jasmine's parents hadn't been there for her the way she'd needed them to be. They hadn't been able to smile at her achievements without remembering Rickey and what should have been. They hadn't been able to smile, period. The grief had been overwhelming, and unlike most families that found a way to go on after tragedy, Jasmine's parents hadn't been able to do that. Jasmine had lost Rickey physically that day, but she'd emotionally lost her parents.Her parents… Jasmine felt only a moment's regret that she hadn't invited her mother and father to the screening, easing her conscience by telling herself that they were so far removed from Hollywood life that a shindig like this one would bore them. Besides, they wouldn't know what to say to people. The troubled world of Miami's north side was a far cry from the glamour and glitz of Hollywood. Her father would no doubt embarrass her with talk of what she'd been like as a child, how she'd been so poor she'd had to wear hand-me-down shoes a size too small. Her mother, sweet but clueless, would have gawked at the likes of Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt, surely humiliating her.But the truth was, Jasmine feared that if her parents had been at the screening of her first blockbuster film, the memory of their missing son would have ultimately depressed them, and as a result, depressed her. And that wasn't something she'd wanted on such an important night.No, she'd done the right thing by not inviting them. \"Come here.\"Startled, Jasmine giggled as Allan's firm hands circled her waist from behind, pulling her buttocks against his arousal. Champagne spilled from the crystal flute as she gained her balance, settling against him. All thoughts of guilt fled her mind. \"Allan…\"His tongue found her ear, gently licking the lobe the way one would lick honey from a rose petal. Jasmine closed her eyes, gripped his thigh…and wondered why she wasn't getting turned on. Her ear was a definite erogenous zone, but as she opened her eyes, she realized that his tongue wouldn't do the job because her mind wouldn't let it.She wasn't ready. \"Damn, Jasmine, you taste so good. You feel so good. Come to the bedroom.\"\"Not yet,\" she replied, then sipped more champagne, hoping it would relieve the sudden annoyance she felt at Allan's impatience, his one-track mind. Recently he'd been cutting short the foreplay and going straight for the main event. He always wanted her in his bed, and yes, he was a great lover, but didn't he realize that she wanted to enjoy this feeling for as long as she could? That not even an orgasm could be better than the natural high she felt right now?Jasmine heard the faint sound of her cell phone vibrating, and while she hadn't wanted to answer it before, she reached into her purse and pulled it out. Once again, she saw her agent's number. \"I should—\"\"Ignore it,\" Allan told her, pulling the phone from her fingers. He tossed it onto the nearby chaise, then continued trying to seduce her.His breath hot on her ear, he ran his hands over her ribs and firmly cupped her breasts. Finding her nipples, he tweaked them through the fabric of her one-of-a-kind sleeveless silver gown. \"Tell me what you want, Jasmine. ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unlike many books that perpetuate some of Fitzgerald’s own myths about her life, Stone’s smooth, straightforward narrative draws from authoritative sources and reveals a “workhorse” artist who devoted herself to developing and sharing her gift with the world. Personal details, particularly about Fitzgerald’s youth, support each chapter, but Stone’s clear emphasis is on the singer’s extraordinary career. The few black-and-white photos are of average quality, but the abundant quotes from Fitzgerald and her musician peers greatly develop the narrative. The author has studied voice, and her brief asides about music, such as what it means for a singer’s voice to mature, are illuminating, while references to the racism Fitzgerald encountered, particularly while touring the South, deepen the profile. Source notes for direct quotes and an extensive bibliography complete this inspiring portrait.

She was a young woman then, facing a divorce or suicide--she wasn’t sure which. And that's why the barren desert of Upper Egypt called to her. The dangerous pilgrimage through a harsh oasis would test her will to survive. As fate would have it, she met Nuweiba on the train--the esteemed Catholic Coptic Bishop of Asyout and Upper Egypt and the first of many holy men who would radically influence her destiny. As she spoke with this humble spiritual leader, he confessed that he was dying. \"Promise me you will return one day,\" he asked Seng. \"Then you will see the future.\" Seng agreed, but it took 15 years to deliver her promise. \"Instead I tried to climb the greased ladder of academia and pretended to forget the promise.\" One night the dying man's request returned to her--forcing her to sit upright in bed and immediately plan her return pilgrimage. This time she would meet with the holy men of the Middle East and ask them to speak to the future. Her adventurous memoir takes us into the private chambers of a grand Muslim sheikh, into darkened churches, ancient monasteries, and modern apartments as she meets with the religious visionaries of the Middle East. The men in black dresses speak about global concerns--pornography on the Internet, disrespect toward elders and children, the disturbing spread of McDonald's culture, and the possibility of miracles. This is an outstanding armchair pilgrimage, filled with vivid \"being there\" scenes as well as lasting insight. Seng manages to unite vastly different religions, histories and cultures through their common spiritual ambitions. --Gail Hudson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book evaluates monetary policy instruments of the Eurosystem against a number of requirements. For doing so, a theoretical model framework is developed which brings together the monetary policy activities of a central bank and the liquidity management of banks considering the main characteristics and institutional features of the euro area. Main results of this analysis are that different costs of obtaining liquidity directly from the central bank can explain the existence of an interbank market in the euro area and the positive spread between the interbank market rate and the repo rate; that the redesign of the Eurosystem’s instruments in 2004 has to be evaluated positively and that a further change to the minimum reserve system would enhance the flexibility of monetary policy in the euro area.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With a precocious 18-year-old daughter, Rosie, a career as a cartoonist and illustrator, a husband who is possessive and moody only part of the time and a biting sense of humor, she seems to have everything (save for the slimmer waist she's been longing for). If only Rosie would stop asking questions about her unknown father, a mysterious gardener whom Fran foolishly slept with one drunken night in college, her life would be perfect. But when Fran catches an episode of the popular television show Restoration Gardener, she immediately recognizes the gorgeous host as the horticulturist from that fateful one-night stand. To make matters worse, he unexpectedly drops by the house Fran is selling and recognizes her, sending her world into a tailspin. Written with quintessential British wit and flair, this romantic comedy chronicles Fran's failed attempts to keep the gardener out of her life and her realization that it might not be easy to forget him. Ashley, author of Every Woman for Herself, creates some delightful characters, from Fran's bohemian mother in \"mock-lizardskin stilettos\" to her quirky, nagging friends, Nia and Rhodri. Though the plot is fairly predictable, the story's success lies in the humorous voice of Fran, who is both lively and self-deprecating as she describes the ups and downs of middle-age life.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He depicts St. Benedict, touted as the saintly father of monks and the monastic way of life, with genuine sincerity as he relates the how and why of their spiritual community in an easy-to-listen-to voice. Polhamus defines the four types of monks and what typifies each lifestyle with a convincing clarity that simplifies complex ideas for the listener.

Have you ever watched a TV show, sitting on the edge of your seat the entire time, and looked at the clock to see that there is only 15 minutes left in the show and they are still trying to figure out what is going on? Then the next 15 minutes are even more intense, more active than you thought possible? Do you love this like I do? Then you need to get -Below-. Victoria is a strong, physical woman who is in charge of a lot of people, both air breathers and water breathers. She doesn-t let control slip through her fingers and maintains a tight grip on those around her. Raphael has a quiet strength and force of command that shows up enough to cause every woman-s heart to flutter. When he states the way things are going to be between him and Victoria my insides turn to mush!

However, David Von Drehle,TIMEmagazine’s editor-at-large, makes a compelling case that the conflict grew solely out of this issue. Von Drehle’s argument is informed by the speeches, news articles, and rhetoric leading up to the secession of southern states, which later took up arms to protect their right to own humans and to move that system of bondage west. What the North fought for was less clear--abolition on moral grounds (when the North itself was built using slave labor and had only decades before ended the practice?) or to prevent disunion, as any alternative may have proved more disastrous than a civil war. Von Drehle also tackles the question of how varying histories of the war’s cause (state’s rights, Northern imperialism) came to occupy our collective beliefs. Though deeply pragmatic, we’re a nation that takes many actions based on our moral principles, and the clear picture of history presented in this Kindle Single is a reminder of our missteps and values.  --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 536909, "title": "Why They Fought", "author": "David Von Drehle", "category": "History", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.3333, "rating_total": 20.0}

Grade 1–4—The legends that endure about Lincoln are many: his log-cabin childhood, his honesty, his eloquence. What is less-often discussed is how he used humor to diffuse tense political situations, disarm critics, and undo the stresses of running the country. His love of words in general, and jokes and humor more specifically, helped him throughout his life when things were difficult, uncomfortable, and downright dire, as they often were during the Civil War. Krull is an expert at teasing out the fun, quirky sides of her subjects and sharing them in a way that is both genuine and engaging. This take on Lincoln is no exception. He is portrayed as an accessible, endearing, and sympathetic figure, not just another president. Children will be drawn in by the straightforward prose, and librarians will enjoy sharing the book aloud. Innerst's colorful and unconventional acrylic illustrations cover the entire page and are the perfect complement to both the text and the subject matter, making this a standout biography.

While serving his newfound lord, the teen hopes not only to find adventure and riches, but also to bring to justice the man who murdered his brother and then stole his inheritance. The story begins a bit slowly, but soon readers will be engaged in the adventure and the grit and gore of the ninth century. The book ends abruptly, with the promise of a continued story line in the future.

Please note that I didn't say \"I\nhave learnt'' because in reality you can't\never know everything there is to know about a language. I'm\na native English speaker and yet I learn new English words all the\ntime.I decided to learn Italian because I booked a trip to Italy with my\nwife for our anniversary and I thought I would learn the lingo so\nthat I could chat with the natives. I bought myself a book which should\nhave had me speaking like Dante in less than a month. You can imagine\nthe cover, ``Italian in 30 days''.\nI didn't learn Italian in 30 days in case you were wondering. I did\nmanage to ask a fellow where my hotel was but was hopelessly lost\nwhen he gave directions in rapid fire Italian. This is one reason\nI really don't believe in learning by rote stock phrases unless the\nanswer is a simple yes or no. You have to be able to comprehend the\nanswer.I struggled on for five or six years trying to learn Italian and never\ngetting past simple three word sentences. Then I decided that what\nI needed wasn't more ``Learn Italian\nin 30 days'' or more audio tapes with a little book.\nWhat I needed was a method for learning a language. The method I developed\nis outlined for you in this book, and part of that method is to hire\na tutor or take a class.My Italian really shot forward when I hired a tutor.Now you're probably thinking ``Hire\na tutor! Spend money! I knew this no cost thing was too good to be\ntrue'' but remember the techniques here are to support\nand accelerate your learning with a class or tutor. At the end of\nthe day you will need someone to correct your mistakes and to help\nwith pronunciation. It is possible you could find someone willing\nto be your tutor for free. Perhaps you can do a language exchange\nto assist them with English? This is what I did with a pen-pal.With an hour a week with a native speaker, and a used textbook I bought\noff a famous Internet bookshop for £2.20 my language skills sky-rocketed.My learning rate quadrupled in the first two months. Then I found\na ``pen pal'' in Italy via a website\non the Internet and used some Internet phone software to speak to\nthem for free. They spoke to me in English (so I could correct them)\nand I replied in Italian.French was a different kettle of fish. I have never had any desire\nto learn French, although it turned out easier in some ways to learn\nthan Italian. I got a job with a company that was predominantly managed\nby French people. My boss was French, and about 30% of the other\nmanagers were also French.Learning French in this environment had rather obvious advantages,\nbut also frequent travel to France was also a factor. I decided to\nlearn a language that I didn't like, and which I had\nno particular motivation toward.Having struggled with Italian I knew immediately whatnotto\ndo if I wanted to learn French as fast as possible. I didn't buy cheap\n``Learn French in 30 days'' books\nand cassettes, I didn't buy a CD and sit in the car hoping that it\nwould all sink in via osmosis. I started in on my language learning\nwithin a week of starting the job, using all the methods I had discovered\npreviously and will share with you in this book.Learning French for me was much quicker than Italian. I would like\nto say it was because I took a year of French in high school but it\nwasn't. Apologies to my French teacher but the only\nthing I learnt in that class was how to say \"cheese\nomelet'' and \"snails''.\nImagine my children's dismay when I told them the\nonly food I would be able to order for them on a French holiday was\na snail omelet with cheese! They marched immediately to their French\nteacher and found out the words for cheeseburger, pizza, and chips.Learning French for me was quicker due to a couple of factors.French is, as the old joke says, about 40% mispronounced English.It is a Latin based language like Italian so I knew probably another\n20% of French from my Italian lessons. The words were the same or\ndiffered only in pronunciation.These factors meant that I already knew about 60% of the vocabulary\nand within two months I could read most things like signs in shops\nor train stations, and menus....", "related": ["B006P2D126"], "rank": 1991930, "title": "Accelerated Fluency: The Guide to Fast, Free, Effective Language Learning", "author": "Rick Dearman", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brewin invites you to look into the eyes of others and squint a little - to see the image of God. He dares you to see the world with new eyes - to look into the mirror and see one who is beloved, to look into the eyes of the orphan and see Christ, to look into the eyes of those whom we find hard to like and catch a glimpse of the One we love. -- Shane Claiborne  With his new book Other, English author Kester Brewin joins Peter Rollins from Ireland and David Dark from the US as leading public theologians for a new generation of thoughtful Christians. He moves gracefully from Scripture to philosophy to pop culture to sociology and back to Scripture again, offering fresh, honest, and needed insights at each turn. I look forward to keeping up with this important voice in the years ahead. -- Brian Mclaren  In our socially networked and technologically advanced world we remain surrounded by mystery: the mystery of others, the divine mystery and mystery that we are unto ourselves. OTHER masterfully explores how we might embrace this often complex reality and draws out how love of that which is other is central to the Christian experience. This is a work of rare beauty. -- Peter Rollins, Ikon  Half-mystic and half hard-core intellectual, Brewin here offers us an intimate, personable, completely accessible and, at times, hauntingly beautiful engagement with the hard questions of emergence theology. This is a brilliant work. It illumines with reverence and care the paradox that is faith, even as it speaks, always with vigour, of love and the reality that lies at the centre of our not-knowing. -- Phyllis Tickle  By turns startling, heart-warming and thought-provoking, Other opens up old themes for a new generation. There are plenty of books that tell you what you expect to hear. This, I'm happy to say, is not one of them. -- Maggi Dawn  '...a brave, generous, wide-ranging and challenging exploration of the essential task facing us all as humans: to love ourselves, God and our neighbours in a world of fractures... It is a book which will become treasured in our festival's community. Indeed, if Greenbelt had a curriculum, OTHER would be required reading.' -- Paul Northup, Greenbelt Festival 20101101", "related": ["B008A5FVMY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In fact, there is a major national award sitting proudly on my desk right now.Often, I get to sit down with clients for 30 or 40 minutes and work through some of their ideas. During these meetings, they get the benefit of what I know and combine that with what they want. The only problem (for them) is that they are usually so focussed on what they want; they either don't hear or don't remember much of what I have advised.Fortunately for you, it is written down here, in easy-to-understand language.

When Patrick's latest undercover assignment for SOCA, the Serious Organized Crime Agency, results in the shooting deaths of criminal Andrea Pangborne, members of her gang and her innocent daughter, the former MI5 agent looks guilty of their murders. The problem is, he doesn't recall what happened because he was drugged. Ingrid, though she's recently given birth to their son, rushes to clear Patrick. Complicating matters is the Case of the Man Who Tried to Take Over a Village and Ended up Dead, involving a rectory being renovated for Patrick's parents, but this serves mainly as filler. Of far more interest is the investigation into the Pangborne slayings, especially after Ingrid discovers a vital clue at the crime scene that others missed.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

On one hand, nearly one in four Americans say they regularly lack enough money to buy food. On the other, approximately one-third are considered to be clinically obese. It is a conundrum, to be sure, and yet the solution may come through something as basic as the community farm. In his profile of Missoula, Montana, Smith energetically demonstrates how one city embraced the local food movement through the establishment of city gardens, food kitchens, co-op subscriptions, college internships, and farm work-therapy programs to transform a population that was as much at risk as any in America into one that now stands as a model for community-supported agriculture. Through dynamic profiles of key players such as Josh Slotnick, director of the Program in Ecological Agriculture and Society; Tim Hall, head of Missoula’s Community Gardens; and Tim Ballard, overseer of the Youth Harvest program for at-risk teens, the entire scope of this citywide confluence of actual needs and agricultural solutions is distilled to the personal level. Bright, vibrant, and buoyantly accessible, this effervescent celebration of the local food movement thrums with regional, national, and international implications. --Carol Haggas", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Malicious, self-important, middle-aged Beth O'Donnell makes her biannual trek from New York to visit her brother, financier Howard O'Donnell, at his estate in Mellingham, north of Boston, in the futile hope of gaining control of the trust fund he set up for her. Earlier failures have led her to get revenge on others, most notably by helping to drive local publisher Lee Handel into bankruptcy. But this time, after attending a large party thrown by her brother, his wife and their grown daughter, Beth is found clubbed to death in their guest cottage. Suspects include Bob Chambers, a young editor whom Beth had threatened; Lee Handel and his wife, and all the members of the dead woman's Mellingham relations, each of whom she had harassed over the years. Chief of police Joe Silva, formerly a big-city cop, gingerly untangles the many motives and alibis. Oleksiw's mystery starts slowly, and her upper-class suspects are somewhat stodgy, but the ordinary citizens of Mellingham--the cops, the restaurant owners and lifeguards--are acutely, affectionately rendered.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Peppered with valuable industry data, in-depth analysis, empirical methods for quality improvement, and economic analysis of quality, this book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in this subject. With the many real-life and up-to-date examples and stories linking software quality to daily-life activities, readers will find this book an enjoyable read.”–Stephen H. Kan, Senior Technical Staff Member and Program Manager, Software Quality–IBM Systems and Technology Group, and author ofMetrics and Models in Software Quality Engineering “Finally, a book that defines the cost and economics of software quality and their relationship to business value. Facts such as the inability of testing alone to produce quality software, the value of engineering-in quality, and the positive ROI are illustrated in compelling ways. Additionally, this book is a mustread for understanding, managing, and eliminating ‘technical debt’ from software systems.”–Dan Galorath, CEO, Galorath Incorporated & SEER by Galorath “Congrats to Capers and Olivier as they release their relevant, extensive, and timely research on the costs of defects in today’s software industry. The authors don’t stop with the causes of defects; they explore injection points, removal, and prevention approaches to avoid the ‘technical mortgage’ associated with defective software products. In today’s ‘quick-to-market’ world, an emphasis on strengthening theengineeringin software engineering is refreshing. If you’re a software developer, manager, student, or user, this book will challenge your perspective on software quality. Many thanks!”–Joe Schofield, Sandia National Laboratories; Vice President, IFPUG; CQA, CFPS, CSMS, LSS BB, SEI-certified instructor “This masterpiece of a book will empower those who invest in software–and the businesses and products that depend on it–to do so wisely. It is a groundbreaking work that rigorously applies principles of finance, economics, management, quality, and productivity to scrutinize holistically the value propositions and myths underlying the vast sums invested in software. A mustread if you want to get your money’s worth from your software investments.”–Leon A. Kappelman, Professor of Information Systems, College of Business, University of North Texas “Capers Jones is the foremost leader in the software industry today for software metrics.The Economics of Software Qualityis a comprehensive, data-rich study of challenges of quality software across the many application domains. It is an essential read for software quality professionals who wish to better understand the challenges they face and the cost and effectiveness of potential solutions. It is clear that much research and thought has been put into this.”–Maysa-Maria Peterson Lach, Senior Principal Software Engineer, Raytheon Missile Systems “In no other walk of life do we resist the necessity and validity of precise, rigorous measurement, as software practitioners have so vigorously resisted for more than fifty years. Capers Jones took up the challenge of bringing sanity and predictability to software production more than three decades ago, and now with Olivier Bonsignour, he brings forth his latest invaluable expression of confidence in applying standard engineering and economic discipline to what too often remains the ‘Wild, Wild West’ of software development.”–Douglas Brindley, President & CEO, Software Productivity Research, LLC", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No one pulls punches. To wit, the Melvins' Buzz Osborne: \"We were futureless people. And then to get to a point where you're buying cars with a credit card and selling 50 million albums worldwide and then you marry a swamp beast and then you end up dead?\" Or Mark Kates (Geffen Records Publicity): \"Like, what's the other most important album that's come out since then?\" The second part is both somewhat beside the point and a lot more fun. It consists of out-takes from Courtney Love's interview, and if you think the woman has lost any of her edgy logorrhea, think again. For Nirvana fans, this piece provides another crucial entry in the wealth of literature that has sprung up around the band since the mid-1990s.

But somewhere in the patchwork, we have tried to present the hard beauty of the land and the history of a unique country and its people.\" They have succeeded. Degrees of Elevation is a wonderful collection that deserves to be read, savored, and remembered.From New York Journal Book ReviewDegrees of Elevation: Short Stories of Contemporary Appalachia brings together 17 gifted writers whose voices are as unique and striking as the region about which they write.Editors Charles Dodd White and Page Seay have gathered some of the finest storytellers of this region, some writers, in White's words, \"not yet established\" and others whose names will be recognized. Ron Rash, for instance, was recently awarded the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award for his own collection of short stories. But whether these writers are still emerging, or whether they have managed to move beyond regional recognition, each casts an unflinching eye toward a region of America that exists in the mists for most of us, offering us glimpses of its raw reality. The lives and choices written about in this collection are hard-edged; there is no romanticizing.In \"Horseweed,\" Chris Offutt introduces us to William, a construction day worker struggling to make ends meet, hoping to one day have enough money to put an indoor bathroom in his home. Growing hemp on mining company land, he tends his crop in the late hours of the night. Confronted by the possibility of arrest in the person of a mining company guard, William realizes that the man has been bitten by a snake and will die without his help. He must choose whether to let this dangerous stranger die--thereby avoiding problems with the law--or to save the man's life and risk his own ruin.\"Magic,\" by Jim Nichols, brings in Joe, a man who does magic tricks. He lives in a trailer park and drives an airport taxi to earn some money. Being arrested after a typical night of bar-fighting has never phased him before; but he's brought to a kind of paralyzing depression when he is made the show-and-tell prisoner for a group of school children visiting the jail.Hunter Tillman is a gay meth-head journalist who falls in with a group of meth-head castrators. Walt Thomas returns home from the war with a self-inflicted blindness that helps him, somehow, to finally see. Ligon Fields, a self-appointed, unordained minister, somehow manages to cast out devils--or at the very least, drive back home missing cats. LaWanda Heever, a big-haired woman with big dreams, realizes she's wasting her days selling fishing bait to the walking dead, and so heads her truck out of town in search of a real life. What all these stories share is that the life they portray is hard. In \"The Coal Thief,\" Alex Taylor writes, \"Coal buckets went empty and houses turned cold for boys just as they did for men and old women. There weren't any favors.\"Degrees of Elevation provides a variety of characters portrayed in their deepest and most exposed moments. You aren't likely to forget their stories.

From manic to elegiac to rough, raw, beautiful, and heartbreaking,  these stories will strike the reader as both absolutely true and as unforgettable, like the high pure ring of an ax on a cold winter morning, vibrating across distance, hanging in the air long afterward.-Lee Smith, author of Saving Grace and Mrs. Darcy Meets the Blue-Eyed StrangerNominated for The Pushcart Prize Award 2010", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He lives in the city of Indio, California with his wife Katherine and son Nash. He is currently working on a follow up novel to Just One More and a novel in collaboration with his son, about his own life growing up in Ohio in the early 1970’s. Mr. Tebelak is a high school English teacher. He loves teaching English and to him, there is no greater good in the world than helping young people become great.  The author also claims that he learns just as much from them as they learn from him.  It is a team approach to learning and it creates a safe learning classroom environment.   The author elaborated more about the classroom and the testing problems that his students have.  He says that the academic language and content vocabulary are tough for them along with positive and negative connotation questions, understanding American idioms, and context questions.  So when he sat down to start writing his novel, Mr. Tebelak pulled out his grade level literary and analysis standards and looked over them.  His novel is flooded with academic language such as figurative language, internal conflict, external conflict, motivations, influences, foreshadowing, flashbacks, imagery, allegory, symbolism, subtleties, contradictions, ironies, tone and more.  This is what motivated the author to keep on writing his book, as long as he believed he was helping his kids with academic language he continued to write.   His most important point on education is no matter what, do not give up on young people, they are our future.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Read on. In the Kindle Single,The Long Run, Mishka Shubaly chronicles his misspent twenties with intoxicating language. \"Alcohol,\" he says, \"is a great aggregator: when you are drinking to excess, every problem seems to fall under that umbrella.\" And Shubaly had problems aplenty, including self-loathing, an appetite for self-destruction, and a disdain for sobriety (which he experienced as relentless anxiety, agony, and amplified boredom). When the author accidentally discovers that running puts his demons at bay better than top-shelf bourbon, he begins to shed his old life and becomes something he never wanted to be: a runner, an ultra-distance runner at that. If running is a substitute addiction, Shubaly says, it's \"the dreariest, most painful, least thrilling addiction I have ever experienced.\" The charms of Shubaly's writing are many: his adoring metaphors for drinking reveal it as his true unrequited love; his self-examination has Thoreau-like depth; and his exposition transforms the pedestrian into the sublime. What's more, Shubaly is earnestly obstinate, yet capable of change; a nihilist, and yet he seeks meaning; a walking contradiction and a joy to spend time with on paper. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00K6JO15A"], "rank": 110400, "title": "The Long Run (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Mishka Shubaly", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 27, "rating_average": 3.963, "rating_total": 107.0}

The accomplishments of the book's main subject \"Ruth\" Tsao Chai are impressive; one of the first women to attend a Chinese university, she worked during World War II as an interpreter for Lady Mountbatten. The story of \"Ruth\" is told in alternating sections by Winberg, a political science professor who has written more than 20 books on China, and by his novelist daughter, May-lee (My Lucky Face). May-lee often provides background information that puts Winberg's personal reflections into historical context. In the sections detailing the family's flight from Nanjing, for instance, we learn from May-lee about the Japanese approach on the city, followed by Winberg's vivid recollections of his childish confusion during the evacuation preparations. Though the alternating narrative voices can distance the reader, overall, this is a gripping and historically grounded read.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A leading researcher on sleep and children, he founded the original Sleep Disorders Center at Children s Memorial Hospital of Chicago in 1982 and is a Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. Dr. Weissbluth discovered that sleep is linked to temperament, that sleeping problems are related to infant colic, and he coined the now-familiar phrase sleep training to describe his method for helping children fall asleep. His findings that changing the time when a child is put to bed dramatically decreases the number of night awakenings were published in the prestigious journal, Sleep, in 1982. His landmark seven-year study on the development and disappearance of naps highlighted the importance of daytime sleep. In addition to his own research, he has written chapters on sleep problems in textbooks for pediatricians, has lectured extensively to parent groups, and has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show. Dr. Weissbluth is the father of four sons and seven grandchildren and they are all good sleepers. Dr. and Mrs. Weissbluth live in Chicago, Illinois. His books, Crybabies, Sweet Baby: How to Soothe Your Newborn, Your Fussy Baby, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, and Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Twins have been published is Europe and Asia and taught millions of parents how to help their children sleep well. Dr. Daniel Weissbluth is a Board Certified pediatrician and completed his residency at Indiana University Riley Children's Hospital. He is an Instructor of Clinical Pediatrics at the Northwestern University School of Medicine. His main area of interest is how various forms of media affect the pediatric population. He co-created the Weissbluth Method Infant Nap App, the Weissbluth Method Toddler Bedtime App, and the Weissbluth Method Parenting Myth App for mobile devices. In addition, he is a regular contributor to the Weissbluth Method Blog.

When she nervously approaches the giant beast in his kennel, the diagnosis was obvious. 'Rambo was stoned'. It emerged that the vigilent guard dog had chased off a drug dealer -- then consumed the prohibited substances abandoned in the persuit. This is Gillian Hick's first book, but will no doubt be the first of many in the James Herriot mould.' -- Countryman 'An enjoyable light-hearted look behind the scenes at the world of veterinary medicine.

Most of his energy went into college degrees in physics, computer science and electrical engineering, which landed him a job at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  He’s been a computer programmer, a manager in computer science, information science, and cyber security, and a cynic of project management.  A lot of his technical writing involved the management of people and projects. That gave him the money and vacation time to learn how to build houses, to backpack in the Rocky Mountain high country, to climb mountains, to snowshoe and cross-country ski, to raft the rivers of the Southwest, to support Christian wilderness programs, and to see the excitement in his sons’ eyes as they enjoyed the adventures with him.  He is still given to wandering. He wishes he was a magician, but he’ll settle for writing mysteries that feature good kids, good families, great places, rich history, and clever plots.", "related": ["B007SGCEFI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Saul’s new-found knowledge is threatening enough that a highly-placed federal official kidnaps his wife Paula in an effort to control him.But even before Saul can attempt to rescue his wife, he finds that the ground rules for everyday life have suddenly changed. Amidst a wave of chaos that descends on the world, a strange new acquaintance, a certain Mr. Jerome P. Mahoney, tries to explain this new reality—and the dilemma it presents:“If I told you that black is now white, Saul T., or that up is down, or that everything you’ve ever believed about mankind and about yourself is a fairy tale and a lie…would you be able to assimilate that, Saul T.?”Saul, like the reader, is skeptical and disbelieving. Talk like this belongs in Star Trek or The Matrix or maybe Invasion of the Body Snatchers -- not in a thriller where good vs. evil seems so readily defined. And yet…Saul finds himself swept up in a puzzling conundrum as he realizes that he may well be a pawn in a high-stakes battle of wits.This is where the twist in Mr. Mahoney Has Left The Building surfaces. This is where Saul hears that a band of dangerously manipulative creatures is somehow behind his wife’s kidnapping and all the strange disorder that has visited the world. Moreover, Saul is told that the outcome of his quest to rescue his wife could determine whether the earth itself will live or die. Even as Saul and Mr. Mahoney pursue Paula’s kidnappers on a frantic cross-country chase, he resists such an absurd proposition. Nonetheless, the fact remains that things now go bump not only in the night . . . but all day long as well.Unlike science fiction, Mr. Mahoney Has Left The Building is firmly anchored in a very recognizable, everyday reality. It's a lucid, literate novel that adroitly mixes suspense with humor—all the  while blending intriguing speculation with a down-to-earth sensibility. It is a dramatic thriller written for a mainstream audience…yet it goes well beyond that. There is a tantalizing, multi-faceted depth to the characters, the action, and the novel itself.", "related": ["B00I5A3MZC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The case study section on religious leader engagement alone makes the book a powerful resource. But it is only when you add the work Moore includes on defining the practice of religious leader engagement in operational terms and its implementation within mission spaces that the full value becomes apparent. This is a book that will feature centrally in the readings for my future courses in humanitarian action, CIMIC / CMCoord, and development practice.(Conor Galvin, University College Dublin and Field Exercise Coordinator, UN Training School, Ireland)Moore helpfully elaborates the evolving role of military chaplains as peacemakers and religion experts in the context of 'whole of government' efforts to establish peace in conflict zones.(Eric Patterson, Regent University)This book perfectly and comprehensively describes one of the most important set of skills and capacities of the whole-of-government approach to intervening in a divided country: listening, learning, and talking with local people. Diplomacy and dialogue between military chaplains and local religious leaders in today’s war zones is not optional, it is essential. Too often, military forces rely on the power of the gun, when real power lies in religious authorities, relationships and networks. Religious leader engagement complements official diplomacy and can enable real openings for greater understanding and transformation that reduces the likelihood of violent clashes. With an insightful command of the broader context and field of peacebuilding, this book will connect the dots for many readers between religious leadership, diplomacy and the role of military forces.(Lisa Schirch, Eastern Mennonite University)Military Chaplains as Agents of Peacebreaks original theoretical ground and roots theory in practice with absorbing stories from the theatre of war. RLE is a brilliantly conceived antidote to the idea that the role of religion in conflict and post-conflict environments is always destructive. Retired Major S.K. Moore, a former military chaplain, demonstrates persuasively that yes, chaplains are brave, vulnerable, empathetic, and caring, but they also play a critical role in peace building, connecting with religious leaders of many different faiths and cultures in 21st century war zones. This is a must read for those trying to fill the gaps in our present national security strategy.(Merle Lefkoff, International Mediator, Center for Emergent Diplomacy)By way of theoretical analysis and documented case studies from a number of countries,Military Chaplains as Agents of Peaceconsiders Religious Leader Engagement as an emerging domain that advances the cause of reconciliation via the religious peacebuildingof chaplains—a construct that may be generalized to expeditionary, humanitarian and domestic operational contexts.An overview of the benefits and limitations of RLE is offered accompanied by a candid discussion of a number of the more perplexing questions related to such operational ministry: Influence Activities, Information Gathering for Intelligence Purposes and the Protected (Non-Combatant) Status of Chaplains.", "related": [], "rank": 2506474, "title": "Military Chaplains as Agents of Peace: Religious Leader Engagement in Conflict and Post-Conflict Environments", "author": "S.

However, to debut author Michael Misiolek, a  novella can be just as bold, raw and captivating.The Gunner's Daughter is a historical satire blending romance and swashbuckling adventure. Set in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, this pre-revolutionary tale of ignorance and reason is shrewdly influenced by an enclave of well-educated African slaves who set the standard for high continental style, culture, and dynasty. It is not an expose of graphic blood and gore, but of the emotional torture people put themselves through to maintain their status and social position in society. While fictional, the work remains true to the narrative of the period.The novella has garnered a consistent buzz on the net. Even the screenplay version received a favorable review by Gordy Hoffman.\"The writing in this story was really strong,\" Hoffman noted. \"The dialogue was excellent - true to the period, unique for each character and intelligent.\" \"On the whole this was a very well-written story with some good characters and strong scenes.\"Even with the promise of success at hand, the author refuses to lose sight of what is really important.\"It's the chemistry between well-defined characters that paints a compelling narrative. If you don't care about the people, you won't care about their story.\" \"I believe my novella achieves this and I urge readers to get a copy.\"", "related": ["B00A9HW1CY"], "rank": 2622580, "title": "The Gunner's Daughter eBook", "author": "M.C.

I was born in Texas, but spent most of my formative years living in Mexico. I've travelled all over the world, experienced many different cultures, ways of life. I've befriended many, for many different reasons. I have always held a dear adoration for people in general, their lives. I am fascinated by the definite differences between Men and Women. In the last few years, I have dedicated a good amount of my time, learning, enduring, these finite differences. In my findings, I realize that men are not so simple, and here is where my fascination lies in. I am constantly wanting to know why, understand their actions, their logic, their rational. Their ability to separate their emotions from what is practical, or logical. I even see this in my two sons, Devin who is almost 21 years old, and my younger son Christian, who is 12 years old. I never stop, i am inspired daily by events, disappointments, misunderstandings, loving moments, fleeting glimpses of what may be, could be, and I write. I want my feelings, my fears, my desires, to come alive in paper. Ultimately, I want to share them with other women in hopes that they will connect with a situation somehow. I write to men, very directly, if a man who is involved with me reads me, he in turn reads himself. I encourage my 11 year old daughter Mia to write, and she has begun. Creative Writing, in my opinion, allows one to self-express. There are no rules, no limitations. In some way, writing can set you free. I encourage it, for anyone to do.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With each new story, I get to explore a new world.\" Vanessa Grant's love affair with writing fiction began at the age of 12 when she decided to write a novel of her own, sitting up in bed using the typewriter she'd been given for her birthday. Not a computer, not an electric typewriter, but a then-state-of-the-art manual typewriter. The story ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life.  In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition. Over the years her love of storytelling and curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and has given workshops to writers' groups in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada.  Vanessa and her husband live on Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest with their two Australian Shepherd dogs.", "related": [], "rank": 1812824, "title": "Island Hearts (Jenny's Turn and Stray Lady) (Vanessa Grant Collections Book 1) eBook", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In fact, she meets a youthful Swiss artist, Christian\nKarl. Christian offers excitement and a step away from her rigid upbringing\nwhen he invites her to pose for a portrait. Captivated by his artistic values,\nshe succumbs to his seduction. The afternoon not only momentarily sets her free\nof the lifestyle that stifles her, but rescues her heart which she believed had\ndied with her beloved husband. She leaves Switzerland\nand Christian behind, thinking that what happens in Basel\nwill stay in Basel... but actions\nwill always have their consequences.Madeleine McDonald pens a novel\nwith characters that live and breathe her homeland! Her main character feels\nweak at first but she consistently grows as the reader turns the pages. The\nauthor does an admirable job of painting a deliciously believable villain in\nPhilip. Unfortunately at times the story feels contrived, with a few twists\nthat seem a little too convenient.Overall though, this fall/summer\nromance is a refreshing change of pace that rises above the typical dynamic.\nMcDonald paints vibrant scenes from Switzerland's\ngreen to the tiny studio of an artist to the landscape of coast and rills and a\ncomfortable home in Scotland. 3 1/2 stars -Ind'tale Magazine", "related": ["B00KFOT9SK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Taking a Wittgensteinian view of language, Tristan Vick takes us on a journey from learning theory to semantics to psychology in this philosophical exploration of whether or not the idea of God holds any relevant meaning. Perhaps more controversial still, Vick makes the case that ignosticism, properly understood, can be used as a positive justification for the reasonableness of atheism.", "related": [], "rank": 1754883, "title": "Ignosticism", "author": "Tristan Vick", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme to take into the air his quiet breath. He said, 'now more than ever seems it rich to die, to cease upon the midnight with no pain while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy!' - They say you must recompense for your past discretions. That you reap what you sow, etcetera, etcetera, and I have found this to be true. You cannot go through life without regard and then move forward without it biting you in the proverbial ass when the due date has passed.The year 1987, found me, a boy of twelve, a fledgling in Satan's army. Too young, many of you will say to understand what I was doing, but as my dear old religious grandma would say; I had reached the age of knowledge. I was now responsible for my actions and my sins. For according to her, if you knew what you were doing was wrong or sinful then you were old enough to know better; therefore, your parents were no longer responsible for your salvation, you were.I was brought up in a good Christian home but the devil had always fascinated me. They taught us that a narrow road led to Heaven and believing in Jesus Christ and following his teachings was our only hope of salvation. They said that following the wicked ways of the Devil, also known as Satan, Beelzebub, and many other names, was a direct route to Hell. Ah... but Satan, Satan is the Tempter. Satan will whisper in your ear, he will tempt you with pleasurable offerings of sex, money, or power and he had already promised and delivered sex in the form of a nineteen-year-old nymph named Katrina. She had taught me the basics and then it was on like a chicken bone; that is until I came down with a case of the crabs and my mama found out. She had to take me to the clinic to get rid of the varmints, and then warned me on the dangers of undiscriminating sexual behavior.My childhood for the most part had been a good one. My mother was too good for her own good. I learned to manipulate her early on; however, my stepfather was a different story, there was no manipulating him. Of course, he was gone most of the time working offshore, but when he was home, he put me through pure hell...The only good thing about him was that within reason, I generally got most anything I wanted because he wanted me to keep an eye on Mama. He definitely did not want her going anywhere or doing anything that he did not know about while he was gone. Those last couple of years was one of the reasons I had begun courting the devil.When my stepfather began to become more violent in his questioning, grabbing me up by my neck as if he thought I was lying, well, I began to pray, and for a few months, I prayed to the Lord that my stepfather would drop dead while he was out there on that boat. When he didn't die, I figured that Jesus wasn't strong enough, but I had heard that you could go down to the crossroads, make a deal with the devil, and in return he would grant your hearts desire.I went down to those crossroads and said \"Devil, here I am\" expecting him to just magically appear and we would do the deed, but he did not show up. I was at a loss as to what to do. Were you supposed to pray to Satan, the same as you did God? I really did not know, so I decided to research Satanism and satanic rituals.I was rebelling, big time. There were days that I would go to school and try to participate, and then there were days that I would go in the front door and straight out the back. I would skip school to hang out with my friends, the ones who smoked pot and lay around all day playing video games.The school library did not have any books on the subject of Satanism and I had never been one to read very much so if I asked to go to the public library, I knew Mama would know that something was not right; therefore, I began to concentrate on the other students and their little cliques.You know how it is. Every school has a student body that separates into certain exclusive groups. You have the jocks, the nerds, the sluts, aka cheerleaders, the skinheads, etcetera, etcetera. Then you have the ones who are into experimentation, those who want to walk on the wild side.They dress in black, paint their fingernails black, and dye their hair black. Some wore eyeliner, trying to look like rock n roll gods such as Ozzy Osbourne or Alice Cooper. I figured they were the ones I needed to get to know. They were the ones who should know what I needed to do, and where I needed to go to find out what I wanted to know. That way, I could make a deal with the devil.It was an easy transition, going from being a plain old country boy living an primitive lifestyle, to one of thuggery and being a satanic wannabe. Of course, Mama noticed the change in my demeanor right away, even before I began to change my appearance, and she must have known that I was courting the Devil, because right away she began to preach to me on the perils of trusting in Satan.\"Son, you don't know what you are doing\" she said sincerely \"All he wants is your soul. You cannot dance with the Devil without getting burned!\" That is what she told me, but it would be many years before I searched my soul and knew that she was right. For years, I wallowed in illicit sex, demonology, drugs, gangs, more drugs... and even watching another boy tortured and viciously murdered, did not wake me up to the truth, not at that time.A foggy, drug induced brain cannot process events very clearly, but, Mama's words would echo through my head, until it did. \"You know, you can play around with the devil, son, but you will have to give him his dues.\" Yes, indeed, she was right and dues I would pay and pay dearly.", "related": [], "rank": 3060357, "title": "Darkling eBook", "author": "Samuel Parker Adams", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My husband and I tried hard to read each page based on the day, but my husband found the meat so tasting and tenderlizing that he just could not put it down. By Day 7, he finished the readings. It is a consistant reminder to us that we cannot take anything, especially our marriage for granted. Our marriage is as precious as a pearl. This book has drawn my husband and I draw closer to God in this greatness called marriage and consistanly reminds us that in all our getting, we must get understanding and seek wisdom from God. We have decided to revisit this book within sixty days as a constant reminder of God's will and purpose for our marriage. I am ordering additional books to give out to married couples both troubled and working. A marriage can be saved if both parties are willing to work at it on a constant basis. God Bless you and thank you, we are very inspired. --V. P., Irvington, NJI picked up the mini-book, A Daily Guide To A Better Marriage out of a Christian Book Store. I actually lost it afterward and ran across it again at a very low point in my marriage. It was through the reading of this little powerful book that my attitude toward my husband and my marriage changed. I realized that although I thought I had tried everything, this book offered an even deeper insight to those things I hadn't even thought of. I haven't gotten my husband to read it yet; however, he benefits from my having read it because I can love him deeper and treat him as I want to be treated. I know that he notices the difference and I pray one day that he will read it or that we will again read it together. I keep it as a reference tool. I thank God for placing this book in my place. --J.

By day I’m training young women to become speech therapists. At night I sip red wine, dial down all distractions, and sink into the fictional worlds I create. Good tunes on my iPod are a must. I get so caught up in my characters that I truly wish the male hero would materialize in the flesh; especially when I see the cover image…I swoon. I have spent the past several years working as a university instructor. My students are young adult females so I’m constantly running plot lines and book covers by them. They make a great beta team!  I love my job at the university but there is something I love even more. . . romance novels. I'll read any genre as long as there are steamy sex scenes and the standard issue HEA ending. Initially I was drawn in by the escape and sweeping emotion of it all, so much so, I began to create my own fictional world. Since I worked during the day my nights were consumed with writing. I was powerless to stop the stories that wanted to be freed from my mind. I actually started to get mixed up. I would think something I wrote at night was something I had said during the working day and vice versa. My friends were worried for my sanity but I assured them I had not gone mad, I was just writing. Once I started I wrote upwards of 3,000 words per day. It was in the early millennium when I became brave enough to share my stories with others. I began to post my stories on fiction websites and then something marvelous happened—I was followed by hundreds of eager readers. I loved my followers and their kind words helped motivate me. These days I am writing books and I’ve learned some things about myself during the process. I like to write series novels because I have trouble letting go. I like a little plot with my romance, erotica, contemporary. Call it what you will, but I have to have a good story in which to sink my teeth. If I start writing a story I have to finish it, even if it’s terrible. My dog is my muse and when he tilts his forehead at me and blinks his large black eyes questioningly at me, I think he is worried I've been sucked into the wormhole of the very fiction that I write. I appreciate his concern but I have yet to fall down the rabbit hole.

On the outside she presents herself as a dutiful daughter and talented violinist, but she hides a deep secret. She is really part of a secret, underground group of cyber-investigators called 04/06 whose mission is to expose injustice and corruption around the world. One day while hanging out at the beach with her best friend, Lian happens upon the washed up dead body of a young girl. As she investigates further, she begins to suspect Harrison Corporation, a clothing company giant that has recently come to Hong Kong to do business with her father's company. As she probes deeper, Lian suspects Matt, the son of the Harrison Corporation's owner. She struggles to solve the mystery of the girl's death all while keeping a fragile hold on her secret life. This is a suspenseful, if uneven, thriller. Lian is a likable character but sometimes seems far more capable than her linited training would suggest. Lian's relationship with her best friend is spot-on, as is her desire to be a good daughter and her concern over her father's stress at work. The Hong Kong setting is fully realized and the descriptions of city life and different areas give the story an authentic feeling. Readers who enjoy a light thriller will appreciate this offering.—Necia Blundy, formerly at Marlborough Public Library, MA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All the characters are forgettable, although the lead, old Charlotte Seymour, supposedly represents glamour unlimited. The narrator, Guy Horton, Char's ex-son-in-law, agrees to act as the woman's \"literary executor\" after her death. Sharing the task (and bed) with Sophia, one of five children from Char's first marriage, Guy studies the woman's diaries from her childhood through life with several lovers and spouses, up to her last moments. Effete, world-weary Guy admits his \"eccentric\" disorientation at losing Char but seems to regard her more from the point of view of a would-be swain than of a fond son-in-law. Moreover, Char's notes turn out to contain few of the sensations promised and nothing relevant to the weak plot.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00GI9969I"], "rank": 2483730, "title": "Running to Paradise", "author": "Virginia Budd", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Also, I\nenjoy watching series on television: \"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Lost,\"\n\"Supernatural,\" \"The X-Files,\" and \"Hannibal.\" All of these have\nelements that influenced my writing.The\n Jake Monday Chroniclesbegan in 2003 when I wrote a short story about an\nassassin named Jake Monday. I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence\n running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began:\n\"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The\n idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and\nstruggling with his past and future, is not unique. I wanted to explore new\n areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the\nmoral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive\nglobal conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made,\nwillingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is\nmy Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own.\n I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not\nbecause they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the\nopposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not\nbelieve in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil\n can be narrow. One wrong move and even someone like Jake Monday can be\nheading in the wrong direction.", "related": [], "rank": 1953821, "title": "Can't Wait for Monday: Jake Monday Chronicles #5", "author": "Robert Michael", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
