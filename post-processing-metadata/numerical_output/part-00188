Taylor, a 14-year-old living on the island of Borneo with her scientist parents, was \"a special sort of test-tube baby.\" Special, indeed. She's one of the first successful human clones, a fact that fills her with resentment. Her angst quickly recedes into the background, though, when rebels attack her family's compound, and she must flee through the jungle with her wounded younger brother and a partly tame orangutan. Her battle for survival is gripping, but as in Halam'sDr. Franklin's Island(2002), the ordeal is just part of the story. Once rescued, Taylor faces a welter of new challenges: numbing grief, an awkward relationship with her guardian (her genetic \"mother\"), and uncertainty about the fate of her faithful ape companion. The teen-as-biotech-experiment premise will remind many readers of Peter Dickinson'sEva(1988),although this novel isn't as cohesive. Though the harrowing losses Taylor suffers may prove too much for some readers, the taut suspense and Taylor's gritty intensity will compel many YAs, especially those who gravitate to dense, philosophically minded sf.Jennifer MattsonCopyright © American Library Association.

The book describes the emergence of the concept in the context of development and educational reform. It traces the debate about non-formal education from its origins in 1968 to the mid 1980s, and looks at the issues that this debate raised. It then describes a number of programmes in different parts of the world which call themselves ‘non-formal’, pointing out the wide range of different views about what is and what is not non-formal. Rogers asks whether we should drop the term altogether or try to reconceptualise it in terms of flexible schooling or participatory education.This is an important new book by a well-established author. It deals with complex issues, but is written in a clear style. It contains an important new analysis of the development paradigms in which the controversies surrounding non-formal education grew up, and which shaped its purpose and impacts. The author’s call for a reformulation of the concept will find echoes not only in developing societies, but also in Western circles, where the language of non-formal education is being used increasingly within the context of lifelong learning. The book grew out of the teaching of non-formal education in which Professor Rogers has been engaged for the last 20 years. It is intended for teachers and students in comparative education courses in higher education institutions, and for researchers and others with an interest in the field.", "related": [], "rank": 4065614, "title": "Non-Formal Education", "author": "Alan Rogers", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Setting his sights on a July 4th hot-dog eating contest, Shermie enlists his friends as trainers, then engages in a cycle of gorging and reversals that come in for prodigiously detailed descriptions. Conveniently, Shermie's science teacher assigns an experiment that familiarizes him with butyric acid, which smells like vomit. Puke. Throw-up, a passage typical of the sensibility at work. Other ham-handed scenes at Del Heiny Junior High, named for the ketchup manufacturer that serves as its corporate sponsor, revolve around attacks by anonymous Mustard Taggers. Halverson (Honk if You Hate Me) tries to build up the mystery of who's behind the mustard revolt but the absurdity of this ketchup vs. mustard feud fizzles any real tension.

Only someone extraordinarily passionate about creating effective communication between museums and visitors and who has worked for many years in all types of museums could have produced such a calm, simply-stated nonpartisan book on what one curator has called 'the great nemesis of museum life.' (Bay HallowellCurator)This book is not merely about choosing words to put on exhibit labels; it is about attracting, communicating, inspiring, and helping visitors get what they are seeking....Once you have read this book, it is impossible to ignore it. I find that Serrell's commentary comes to mind during all of my writing activities. One of the most notable qualities that gives the book its lingering nature is Serrell's personable voice throughout the text....This is an important text for anyone who is involved with the creation of exhibitions. (Kirsten Ellenbogen, (King's College London)Journal Of Interpretation Research)Surely a masterpiece. The author has done a great job in explaining to the reader about creating interpretive signage, where words compensate for sensory experience...This book has filled the void that existed in the field of exhibit presentation in museums and zoos worldwide. (Bipul Chakrabarty, Indian Central Zoo AuthorityJournal Of The International Zoo Educators Association)In this easy to read book, Serrell thoroughly shares her vast experience on label design by explaining all aspects to consider, not only from the designer's point of view, but also, and most importantly, from the sudience's perspective...From physical aspects such as space, layout, lighting and materials, to conceptual aspects such as objectives, ideas and messages, to finally human aspects focusing on visitors' expectations, backgrounds and learning styles, they are all part of this excellent step-by-step guide to designing and building successful exhibit labels...Perhaps the most valuable lesson in this book is the urgent need for a systematic evaluation of exhibit labels, before and after they are built...This is well received at a time when professionals involved in the field of environmental education are really questioning the effectiveness and impact of exhibit labels on the visiting public...Serrell's work illustrates how developing front-end, formative and summative evaluations offers a thorough process for adjusting the designer's ideas with the public expectations. (Rosamira Guillen, Barranquilla Botanical and Zoological FoundationJournal Of The International Zoo Educators Association)Clearly presented, flawlessly argued, and filled with both visual and verbal examples, I was most impressed by the layout. The book itself is a metaphor for the ideal exhibition about which all museum educators dream.

Tracing ideas of manliness through the work of such Western writers as Aristotle, Homer, Jane Austen and Ernest Hemingway, among many others, Newell argues for a return to traditional ideas of manhood to inspire young men \"to treat others-and themselves-with respect.\" He reminds readers that men need \"the five main ingredients of a satisfying life\": love, courage, pride, family and country. Through the ages, Newell writes, love meant sensitivity and nobility, while courage and pride were about \"the struggle to defend and extend justice and to overcome our own baser instincts.\" Somewhere along the way, though, the image of the traditional \"manly heart\" was lost, and men turned to misogynistic machismo and senselessly violent behavior to prove their manhood. Newell insists that a balance among the five manly virtues is the key to reversing the contemporary man's detachment from loving-kindness and his tendency toward \"brutal spasms of reactive violence\" (such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the Columbine high school massacre and the 9-11 attacks). Those resistant to reducing men-and women-to a set of \"natural\" character traits take note, for this book certainly considers the Mars/Venus school of thought a flawed accomplice in undermining all that is positive about men and their potential contributions to a just and happy society.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the author introduces the characters, Trajan and Saris, the reader soon realizes that other than their race, there are no similarities between them and Chellak and Demyan. Trajan, a fierce warrior who will do anything to protect his mate, is more of a gentle giant, whereas Saris is by no means the submissive type and is sure to give Trajan a run for his money. Regardless of misunderstanding or enemy arrival, the intensity of feelings these two share is easy to see. This is an excellent follow up and while I know the author has several great series in the works already I hope we will be able to visit more of this world.\" -- Lydia, Rainbow Reviews5 CUPS: \"Dream Mate is the sequel to Katzman’s Mate, and a truly to-die-for story! I loved Saris’s spunk and his determination to help other bruters. Trajan has your typical alpha male mentality, but he is definitely not your typical alpha male; his personality is more black and white, which I thought in this case was a good thing because that is what Saris needed. This is one story where both the main characters have very strong and well-defined personalities that clash from time to time but still complement each other. The sex is positively singe-worthy as well. When these two finally do come together, it is explosive.

The book re-opens the controversy about \"facilitated communication\", a method of enabling people who cannot speak to communicate using an alphabet board or keyboard.Pioneered in Australia by Rosemary Crossley, the technique is now used around the world. Crossley taught Lucy how to use the Cannon communicator to write words on ticker tape. A facilitator - in Lucy's case her mother - supports the arm of the keyboard user and in time the person learns to generate words.Controversy has arisen over the role of the facilitator who determines which key is struck and hence is the real author of the words generated.The book provides unique reflections on the inner world of autism, but the critical reader who generated these insights.

Edgar. As an infant he was adopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, before transferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa.In 1898, he published a collection of poems called 'The Mission that Failed', and subsequently left the army to become correspondent for Reuters. South African war correspondent for 'The Daily Mail' followed and his articles were later published as 'Unofficial Dispatches'. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentials. He then edited the 'Rand Daily Mail', but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market.Returning to England, Wallace at first reported on crimes and hanging trials, before becoming editor of 'The Evening News'. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing 'Smithy', a collection of soldier stories, and 'The Four Just Men'. The latter was published with the ending removed as an advertising stunt and he offered $500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallace also worked as a journalist on 'The Standard', 'The Star', 'The Week-End Racing Supplement' and 'The Story Journal'.In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln's Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his 'Sanders of the River' books. In 1923, he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidate for Blackpool.Wallace's first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King.Along with countless articles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories, Wallace wrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920's one of Wallace's many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by 'The Bible'.He died in 1932 whilst working on the screenplay for 'King Kong', having moved to Hollywood after being offered a contract by RKO.", "related": ["B00263KWKW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, like most cities, Minneapolis has its own checkered history.Iric Nathanson shines a light in dark corners of the city's past, exploring corruption that existed between the police department and city hall, brutal suppression of Depression-era unions, and reports on anti-Semitism at midcentury. Still other subjects that on the surface seem disparaging offer the city's residents as opportunity to shine. Community leaders make a difference during the \"long hot summer\" of 1967, when racial violence exploded across the country. Concerned neighbors guide transportation policy from more and bigger highways to forward-looking light rail transit. A forgotten riverfront is transformed into a magnet for people wishing to live and play at the site of the city's earliest successes.Nathanson skillfully tells these stories and more, always with an eye toward how noteworthy characters, plotlines, and scenes helped create the Minneapolis we know today.Iric Nathansonhas written and lectured about local history for more than two decades. An instructor for the University of Minnesota's Ocher Lifelong Learning Institute, he has published essays in theStar Tribune,Minnesota History, andHennepin History.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her step aerobics class had been especially rigorous today, and she knew she'd pay the price tomorrow.Ronnie was thirty years old and a former couch potato. So when it came to exercise, her body was in a constant state of rebellion.\"After you've done it for a while, you'll start to love it,\" her best friend, Cara Gray, a former fitness instructor at the trendy Tower Vista health club, had often told her. But Ronnie had been working out seriously for over a year… and she still hated it.Ronnie headed from the locker room to the club's juice bar, The Big Squeeze, where she and Cara hung out after their workouts. The state-of-the-art gym in Bethesda, Maryland, was a bit of a drive from her new town house in Washington, D.C., but it was worth it to keep up their tradition. Without Cara's constant pep talks, Ronnie would have quit a dozen different times already.Even though Cara was now helping her husband, A.J., run their computer consulting business, the women still met at the gym three times a week. But her best friend didn't need the workouts. Cara's years of physical fitness had apparently made her body fat resistant even after three kids. But Ronnie, who worked with food for a living, needed to exert herself to stay fit.As Ronnie entered the juice-bar area, she saw that Cara was already waiting for her. Cara had placed a shot glass filled with a ruby-red juice at her seat. It looked like blended berries, so Ronnie picked up the glass and filled her mouth. As soon as the thick liquid touched her tongue, she nearly gagged.\"Ugh. What the heck is this?\" she sputtered. \"It tastes like…beets.\"Cara laughed at Ronnie's yuck-face. \"And hello to you, too.\" She nodded to Ronnie's half-empty glass. \"It's a special blend of carrots, beetroot and grapefruit juice, so good call on the beets.\"Ronnie wiped her tongue on her napkin. \"And you thought I would like thiswhy?\"\"Because it's good for you,\" Cara said with a mischievous grin. \"I figured you were ready to kick things up a notch.\"Ronnie shoved the glass across the table. \"Well, I guess I'm not, because I'm not drinking any more of this.\"\"Ron-nie! You're a chef. Your highly trained palate should be able to handle a little beetroot.\"\"Honey, I may have a newly skinny body, but that doesn't mean I have skinny taste buds.\" She swiveled her neck, feeling her curly ponytail swinging at her nape. \"If there's one thing I've learned in the last few months, it's everything in moderation.\"She eyed the offending glass. \"And some things innada-ration.\"Cara rolled her eyes, having finally learned to ignore Ronnie's affinity for making up words.Ronnie caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirrored panels behind the bar. It still shocked her to see that her round frame had been replaced with an hourglass. As a chef, she'd worn her extra weight as a badge of honor—a testimony to the quality of her food. For years she'd told all who would listen, \"If I lost weight, people would think my food wasn't any good.\"She'd been a member of Tower Vista for as long as her friend had worked there, but it was only recently that she'd gotten serious about working out. The good old days had been all about massages, dips in the hot tub and fruity juice-bar drinks—all the perks of belonging to an upscale gym without the perspiration or sore muscles. But after coping with some harsh realities in recent years, Ronnie had realized it was time for a few drastic changes.Her dream of opening her own restaurant had finally come to fruition, and she'd lost nearly eighty pounds. But the most significant weight she'd lost was the one-hundred-eighty-pound no-good ex-boyfriend she'd finally cut loose.Now she was happily single, and the only male she needed was her German shepherd, Baxter. Baxter provided affection, security and above all.loyalty—the one thing she'd never been able to get from a man.\"Fine. You're off the hook for today.\" Cara took back the red shot and downed it in one gulp. \"But I'm not giving up the battle. I'm going to turn you into a health nut sooner rather than later.\"It's never going to happen,Ronnie thought, but she kept that fact to herself. When she'd decided to get in shape, Cara had been beside herself with glee. Even though she no longer trained professionally, she'd taken Ronnie's weight loss on like a job, mapping out a strict regimen of diet and exercise. Now, even though Ronnie was happy with her current figure, Cara was still trying to push her further and further into the realm of fitness fanaticism.\"Yeah, good luck with that. In the meantime, I've got some news.\"Her friend's eyes lit up. \"What kind of news? Are you ready to start dating again?\"Ronnie rolled her eyes. Sure, three years was a long dry spell without a man, but she still hadn't reacquired her thirst. And the time on her own had done her a lot of good.\"Believe me, this has nothing to do with any man. I've been invited to participate in another Gourmet TVFood Fight.\"Cara blinked. \"That's great, Ronnie, but you do those all the time.\"Ronnie smiled. \"Yes, but this one is special. It's the first everAll-Star Food Fight.They're taking the top winners from the last two years and pitting us against each other in a three-part challenge. The prize is one hundred thousand dollars!\"Cara's eyes widened with surprise. \"You're kidding me. That's ten times what you usually win.\"\"I know, and that's not all. Each round takes place in a fabulous place—Las Vegas, Hawaii and Paris.\"Cara clutched a hand to her heart, her almond eyes taking on a dreamy expression. \"You lucky girl. I've always wanted to visit Paris.\"Ronnie's posture collapsed. \"Well, there's no guarantee that I'll make it to Paris. The challenge starts out with five contestants. With eliminations after the first two rounds, only the top three will get to go to Paris.\"Her friend, loyal to the end, waved off her concerns. \"Oh, don't worry. I know you'll make it to the final three. One, because none of those chefs have the creativity and flair you have. And two, because I'm so going to visit you in Paris for the finale.\"Ronnie released a tense breath, and Cara reached across the table to give her hand a reassuring pat. \"Crave has been open for almost two years, and it's already received four-stars. You have nothing to worry about.\"\"Thanks for the vote of confidence, but there's going to be some pretty stiff competition. In fact, against most of these celebrity chefs, I definitely qualify as an underdog.\"\"Really? Whoarethe other chefs?\"\"First, there's the queen bee herself, Etta Foster.\"Etta Foster, a cross between Martha Stewart and Sarah Lee, was a household name. She had the most extensive line of cookware and frozen foods of any chef in the business. That was aside from her franchise of cooking shows on Gourmet TV. Yet despite her vast culinary empire, she still evoked the down-home image of a Southern grandma baking in her country kitchen.Cara shrugged. \"Etta Foster is a powerhouse, but she's old-fashioned. Your modern approach will blow her out of the water.\"\"Okay, but I'll still have to face off with Ann Le Marche and Stewart Compton.\"Her friend, who only watched GTV when Ronnie was on it, was unimpressed. \"I've never even heard of them.\"\"Well, I'm certain you've heard of my biggest competition, Ace Brown.\"Cara gasped. \"Ace Brown? The Sexy Chef himself?Now you're talking. Finally a chance to prove yourself against your old culinary-school rival. Wiping the floor with him will put the icing on your victory.\"Ronnie laughed. She and Ace had always been friends, but there had been an air of unspoken competition between them. They'd gone head-to-head many times in school, but unfortunately he had more points in the win column than she did. Since graduation, his career had grown to overshadow hers entirely.Ace had been on the fast track, landing himself a show on Gourmet TV calledThe Sexy Chefsoon after building his reputation on the Manhattan restaurant scene. His show had focused on romantic meals prepared from ingredients considered to be aphrodisiacs. Despite the show's popularity, when his contract was up, he'd decided to leave television to travel the world.Ronnie hadn't seen Ace in nearly two years, and she couldn't help but feel a tad excited to show off her recent successes.Every woman in culinary school had had a crush on Ace, herself included. But since she'd had a boyfriend at the time, Ronnie had been able to pretend she was the lone female on earth immune to his charms. As a result, they'd become good friends.Ace's face flashed in her mind. Back then he'd had a full head of curly hair, a clean-shaven baby face and a leanly muscled body. When Ronnie had started catchingThe Sexy Chefon GTV, she'd noticed that Ace had become so buff he'd needed to cut the sleeves off his chef's jacket to free his massive guns. He'd also shaved his head and grown a neat mustache and goatee.Combine his smoking hot physique and his natural charm in front of the camera, and you had the recipe for sexy. His show had been aptly named, and Ronnie suspected that when it had been on the air, his female viewers tuned in more for the tasty sight of Ace than for his romance-inspired haute cuisine.Ronnie had never really been immune to his charms, but a guy like Ace had his pick of women. So why would he have gone for the pretty but pleasantly plump version of her? There were plenty of men who'd appreciated her voluptuous curves. But judging by the swarm of skinny women that had surrounded Ace, she didn't have any reason to believe he was one of them.Therefore, it had been easier for her to pretend that she wasn't interested. To sell the lie she'd joked that she was ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the Soviets invaded in September 1939, the countess joined the resistance and eventually evaded arrest by fleeing to German-occupied Kraków, where she worked with the Polish Red Cross and continued her resistance activities. At Stanislawow, where she had been delivering care packages to prisoners, Lanckoronska was briefly imprisoned and local Gestapo chief Hans Krüger confessed to her that he had murdered 23 University of Lvov professors, a war crime she made it her mission to publicize. Imprisoned at Ravensbrück because of her political activities, the ever-resilient Lanckoronska cared for victims of medical experiments and taught art and European history. She eschewed her privileged status to join the ranks of prisoners, but as a Christian Lanckoronska never shared the ordeal of Jewish concentration camp prisoners, and her memoir says little about atrocities committed against European Jewry. Although the style is stilted and restrained, this is still a worthy, unsentimental eyewitness account that sheds welcome light on a tumultuous era of modern Polish history. 8 pages of b&w photos; map.(Apr. 5)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While one tool cannot be blamed for the entire global financial crisis, improving the flexibility and statistical reliability of existing models, in addition to developing better models, is essential for both financial practitioners and academics seeking to explain and prevent extreme events.Nobody understands this better than the expert author team of Svetlozar Rachev, Young Shin Kim, Michele Leonardo Bianchi, and Frank Fabozzi, and in Financial Models with Lévy Processes and Volatility Clustering, they present a framework for modeling the behavior of stock returns in a univariate and multivariate setting—providing you with practical applications to option pricing and portfolio management. They also explain the reasons for working with non-normal distributions in financial modeling and the best methodologies for employing them.This reliable resource includes detailed discussions of the basics of probability distributions and explains the alpha-stable distribution and the tempered stable distribution. The authors also explore discrete-time option pricing models, beginning with the classical normal model with volatility clustering to more recent models that consider both volatility clustering and heavy tails. This practical guide:Reviews the basics of probability distributionsAnalyzes a continuous-time option pricing model (the so-called exponential Lévy model)Defines a discrete-time model with volatility clustering and how to price options using Monte Carlo methodsStudies two multivariate settings that are suitable for explaining joint extreme eventsAnd much moreFilled with in-depth insights and expert advice, Financial Models with Lévy Processes and Volatility Clustering is a thorough guide to both current probability distribution methods and brand new methodologies for financial modeling.", "related": [], "rank": 3014683, "title": "Financial Models with Levy Processes and Volatility Clustering (Frank J.

Sketches of women poets from Puritan Anne Bradstreet to Denise Levertov, the sole woman of the 1960s Black Mountain School, lead to a concluding \"Letter to a Young Woman Poet,\" describing Boland's struggle to create poems from her life as a mother. Asserting \"the strengths that exist in the communal life of women,\" Boland offers encouragement to women poets of the future. If some of her language is directed to those writing or reading poetry, her vivid imagery (\"if this were a summer darkness in Ireland the morning would already be stored in the midnight\") will beguile many.

At center stage is Noam Chomsky whose search for the innate structures underlying language revolutionized what had been primarily a descriptive, behavioristic science. Chomsky's followers, notably George Lakoff, James McCawley, Paul Postal and Haj Ross, came to view Chomskyan \"deep structure\" as a barrier to forging a link between sound and meaning. Their work, known as generative semantics, has been denounced by Chomsky as a heresy, but Harris, an English professor in Britain, credits generative semantics with making linguistics a vibrant, pluralistic field by introducing a crop of phenomena and methods which Chomsky had ignored. At the moment \"things don't look especially bright\" for Chomsky's model of language and mind, opines Harris, who asserts that the embattled, isolated Chomsky has borrowed ideas from his rivals and erstwhile followers.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So why did these banks continue to buy tens of billions of dollars' worth of mortgages and package them into securities they had trouble selling? And why did they then sell these worthless securities internally to other divisions within their own banks? ProPublica, an independent, non-profit news organization, sent a team of reporters to investigate. What they found will leave many readers feeling simultaneously astonished and outraged. The actions that led to the collapse of many investment banks and amplified the international financial crisis can be traced back to a handful of executives trying to increase the size of their bonuses. Uncovering and making sense of complicated, esoteric, and shady financial dealings is no easy task.

Her escape, however, is brief. After Razz wins a major competition, the teens must return to their hometown so that he can do an interview with local reporters. Worse troubles loom overhead when a tornado devastates Allie's neighborhood and destroys her house. She makes her way through the wreckage, attempting to find her parents, and in the process finds strength she never knew she had. Death Wind is a fast-paced, exciting work, but it offers little beyond the surface. Characters remain shallow, and problems are resolved easily. The mood, however, remains tense and readers are kept enough on edge to see the story through to the end. Reluctant readers interested in skateboarding may be drawn to it, but they'll probably forget it soon after they read it.

The author takes the concept and inserts enough detail\nto quickly define the environment, atmosphere, and characters. This enables the\nreader to promptly label the players. The main characters are likable,\nparticularly the protagonist Ferrell, Alex and his daughter Hannah, and Brother\nSebastian. Then there is the evil antagonist, Kraken, with whom the reader will\nquickly grow to hate. The plot, while based on a well-used concept, is well\nthought out and constructed in a manner to keep the reader's attention and\ninterest.

Although Congress has been instrumental in many of these post-9/11 executive branch reforms, it has been largely unable to reform itself. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission called congressional oversight \"dysfunctional\" and warned that fixing oversight weaknesses would be both essential to American national security and exceedingly difficult to achieve. Why have these deficiencies persisted for so long, despite the clarion call for change after 9/11 and the unprecedented importance of intelligence in today's environment?   InEyes on Spies, Amy Zegart argues that many of Congress's biggest oversight problems lie with Congress itself. Although acknowledging that intelligence policy making has undoubtedly become more partisan and rancorous in recent years, and that individual personalities matter, she shows that the root causes of dysfunctional intelligence oversight cross party lines, presidential administrations, individual congressional leaders, and eras. The author first attempts to define what good oversight looks like—and concludes that, however one defines good oversight, Congress has not been doing it in intelligence for a very long time. She examines existing research in both political science and intelligence studies and finds that both literatures have insights and limitations when it comes to understanding enduring intelligence oversight weaknesses. Taken together, however, both literatures provide essential elements for understanding why intelligence oversight has remained so problematic for so long. Zegart also compares oversight activities of intelligence to other policy areas and reveals that intelligence oversight is always an uphill battle because the issue is always a political loser. In looking specifically at what's wrong, she finds two crucial institutional deficiencies: limited expertise and weak, fragmented budgetary authority.The author concludes by suggesting policy implications for the future of intelligence oversight-and the picture is not encouraging. The sources of oversight dysfunction, she explains, lie with electoral incentives and institutional prerogatives, and these are not about to disappear. As long as all members of Congress protect congressional committee prerogatives and engage in every-man-for-himself calculations of political self-interest, the current inadequacies in intelligence oversight are unlikely to improve.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This review is from: Trucker's Nightmare (Kindle Edition)  Great book! Sex, drugs, love, hardship and triumph, the book has it all (and a little bit of satire to boot). Extremely entertaining, I couldn't put it down (read it in less than 24 hours). The story gives a candid view of life behind bars; the stuff you never hear about. Incredible story that had me guessing till the end --By Max Chancy , Max Chancy (Carlsbad, CA)5.0 out of 5 stars A definite page turner, June 7, 2012  By Kareema Brown - See all my reviews Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)  This review is from: Trucker's Nightmare (Kindle Edition)  Trucker's Nightmare is really great read. You don't have to read a whole chapter to see if it will be worth reading. You get caught up in the characters and scenario from the beginning, and can't wait to see what the next page or chapter will brings. A definite page turner and great read. It gives the reader a humbling view of what its like for some incarcerated females.  The powers that be can do whatever they choose, and sometimes there's nothing you can do about it, and then again, you can.  Thanks for thoroughly entertain me. I will definitely recommend the Truckers Nightmare.  Margaret Marria --By Kareema Brown - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)5.o out of 5 stars An excellent read, June 16, 2012  By Gabriel Pittman. Wow! You were right . . It was worth the wait! I got my book at 3:00 p.m., and finished reading it at 9:00 p.m. You really did your thing! The way you interwove the plot between all the characters made for an attention grabbing tale. Anyone who reads this book and isn't emotionally attached to Eva's personality and plight has some serious issues. All your character development were great. Even your scene development . . . It puts me there. And the erotica was over the top. I know there got to be a part two. To anyone reading this review this is a must read. You will not want to put it down unti the end and then want to read some more. --By Gabriel Pittman.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In short, a good read\n for almost any mood, and an interesting idea of how the post zombie\napocalypse may play out when dropped in the laps of Nerdcore's finest.\nI'm glad it was kept as a novella. I feel that the author knew when this\n story was done, and that's something many amateurs miss: a good ending.\n Kudos, Jason.

His power is mainly the ability to find horrible crimes and get there before they happen. The rest is up to him, a normal man with no particularly special skills or talents. So, in other words, he one of us. A regular person.He's not a billionaire playboy, or lost son of a distant alien race, he's just a man that doesn't have a choice, so tries to make everything work as best he can.The response to this character has been overwhelming, to say the least.

Having grown up on Danielle Steel and Stephen King, Ginger both reads and writes a variety of genres from kids books to horror. Titles such as MY IMMORTAL and TASTE OF BLOOD are a delicious, heady mix of potent genres like horror, suspense and romance. Genre romance, however, has held a special place in her heart ever since she read her first Harlequin novel when she was only eleven. Today Ginger writes romances of her own, starring women who look more like the average American woman rather than those traditionally represented in the size-biased American media. Her \"Real Woman Romance\" Rubenesque series was created especially for those romantic heroines with fuller figures who can still get the man of their dreams if only they believe they can.

The story is well written, taking us on a roller-coaster ride of murder and intrigue. I highly recommend this thrilling suspense novel.Martha Cheves, Reader/ReviewerComa Sins is a deep story of a man who did and didn't commit the crimes that he will eventually be blamed for. How do you commit yet not commit a crime? You can be insane or you can dream them. Question is, which did Ben do or did he do all?Fran Lewis, ReviewerBen Bluman has created a world within his own mind so diabolical, so horribly destructive. Yet, is this world his own form of reality? Is this a world that he created out of the visions, voices and fears that engulfed him for years? Enter his mind and decide for yourself-- is he sane? Meet him, would you want him for a friend?Coma Sins is fascinating and makes you really wonder when you look at people in the world. Perhaps Blumen's life explained some of the tragedies we see on the news. This is one book you will not want to put down once you start reading it. An intricate web is woven and the reader is ensnared in that web from page one.SINGLE TITLES/DebbieSINGLE TITLES REVIEWReviewer: Debbiesingletitles.com/?p=7537On the surface Ben Bluman appears to be a normal person - someone you can trust and depend upon.

A must for first-year freshman students, examining the question of 'what is stress and how can I master the situation before it gets out of hand?'\"- Linda R. Barley, York College, CUNY, USA\"Stress precedes many of the common chronic diseases in medicine today, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc. The use of preventive techniques to manage the lifestyle behaviors that contribute to these diseases would appear to be a beneficial approach in the control of their effects and incidence. The stress management techniques and principles in Kottler and Chen's text provide individuals with the knowledge to achieve the sense of control and autonomy that result in enhanced quality of life and health status. I highly recommend this text.\"- Ellen Lee, California State University, Fullerton, USA\"I believe that undergraduate students will embrace this book as a source of knowledge, but will also be able to really use the information in the book and the exercises in the activities manual to better their lives and manage their stress effectively.\"- Steven J. Radlo, Western Illinois University, USA\"Kottler and Chen address the many forms and facets of stress in a reader-friendly manner. The text is educational, informational, and a rich resource for anyone seeking guidance and support in managing the stresses of life.\"- Kathleen Grace Santor, Stress Management Center of Nevada, USA\"Stress Management and Prevention: Applications to Daily Lifehas several features that merit serious consideration for adoption as a text or as a resource for providing stress management interventions. The treatment of stress across the Lifespan provides a context for applying the intervention and prevention strategies at alternative developmental levels. There is also an excellent treatment of individual and cultural differences in the way stress is experienced. The organization of the material reflects the extensive background in stress management.\"- Keith W. McCoy, The University of Texas at Tyler, USA \"This book is a cut above traditional books largely because of the inclusion of the 'resilience and stress chapter' as well as the 'optimal functioning to make your changes last' chapter. Both of these chapters bring the positive approach to stress management in a world that overly focuses on problems rather than strengths.\"- Glenn E.

It is scary to learn in the book that workers waste up to 40 per cent of their time every day. The book is very clearly and positively written and packed full of invaluable advice. It shows how so much of being productive comes from within. There is no such thing as being born untidy or disorganized: we allow ourselves to become like that. We learn what the twenty most common mistakes are that entrepreneurs make and how to correct them. We need to overcome our negative programming and establish the 4Ps of personal time management. By putting into place certain processes and creating checklists to follow we can establish effective behaviour patterns, set achievable goals and draw up our own personal development plan. The book is well laid out. Each topic is dealt with succinctly and with encouragement and clarity. The author seems to be genuinely on our side. The message clearly comes over that it is up to us to adopt the right attitude and take control of our entrepreneurial destiny. There is no place for feeling like an overworked victim. With thought, organization and determination you can do and in fact become efficient and fulfilled. Every page offers a snippet of advice somewhere and as you complete each section of the book, you feel that you are already taking big steps to get more out of each day.

The Founding Fathers gave us a way to frame our most\nimportant questions; they did not give us the answers to those questions.\nNowhere is this easier to see than in the current debate over guns and gun\ncontrol. Even if we wanted to, we could not recapture the social and political\ncontexts that produced the Second Amendment. To start, we would have to disband\nthe professional military, require all citizens to own guns and to undergo\nregular military drills in public parks. Even then we would not recapture the\ncontext, but we would look awfully silly trying.            But we can try to recapture some of\nthe deepest meanings of the eighteenth-century context in ways that are\nrelevant to the present. From the earliest days of the American republic,\nbearing arms was both a civil right and a civic responsibility--in much the same\nway that voting and serving on juries are now seen as both privileges and civic\nobligations. The militia was not simply all citizens bearing arms; it was all\ncitizens bearing arms and entering into a compact to train together, serve\ntogether, and protect each other's lives and interests. It was perhaps the most\nimportant aspect of citizenship in the early republic.              In\nthe beginning, then, bearing arms had something to do with being willing to work\nfor the public good. It still should. Owning firearms for the public good does\nnot mean trying to wrest every single right one can from the Constitution\nwithout ever asking what responsibility one owes to the society that ensures\nthose rights. It does mean recognizing that, for all of the acknowledged\nbenefits of gun ownership, it brings some problems too, and society has both a\nright and a responsibility to address those problems. At the very least, those\nwho own guns and also believe that rights and responsibilities cannot be separated in a functioning republic should be willing to be part of this\nconversation.", "related": [], "rank": 1211416, "title": "That's Not What They Meant About Guns!", "author": "Michael Austin", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was educated in Jamaica at Kingston College and Camperdown High Schools and later attended the College of Arts, Science and Technology where he received a Certificate in Marketing. He then went on to the University of the West Indies where he completed a Bachelors degree in Management Studies and years later read for a Masters degree in Education at the University Of Phoenix, Arizona.  His business education was set in motion by a 13 year stint with the largest food distribution company in the island where he rose to the position of Divisional Manager. His education not only informed his business foundation but exposed him to the critical issues that shaped the island and impacted his social and political consciousness. To this end he has written as much from his personal experiences as he has from the historical developments in the island over the period.", "related": ["B005OMBH7Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Violet suddenly abandons husband #5, Marshall, his jealous suspicions lead him to another of Violet's exes, Costa. Bonding over their shared marital battle scars, they go on to befriend Violet's other ex-husbands, including unstable Brian, dutiful Tim, and lovesick Owen. The men, united by their common fixation, together begin to find a way of coping with life after Violet. Meanwhile, their beautiful, narcissistic, therapy-loving ex-wife has set her sights on a new target: Jake, the one man who never fell for her wiles. Learning this, the men decide to find Jake and warn him of Violet's sinister power before it's too late. A diffuse structure and stereotypical characters prevents the novel from building up much suspense before reaching its forgettable climax. Violet herself remains a frustrating cipher, leaving the reader wondering why her ex-husbands are still obsessed with her. As a tale of romantic loss, though, the novel is more successful, offering a moving portrait of the neurotic fixations of unhappy lovers and the bonds they forge to overcome grief.

(D. A. Harvey, New College of FloridaCHOICE)This fine study of French spiritism in the nineteenth century confirms a growing recognition by historians that various forms of modern religiosity survived the development of materialist critique of traditional religion. These movements, which Sharp deftly and judiciously surveys here, combined the humanist vision of a progressive and egalitarian society with a mystical faith in everyday miracles. It provides a more complex story about the growth of reason and the decline of religious observance than can be told in the conventional discourse of the struggle between clericalism and anti-clericalism.

In this alternating approach, you are offered lots of benefits allowing you to go for a number of hours at a given time without worrying about taking a meal.It also means one can take higher calories meals within the eating period without worrying so much about weight gain risks.How should you choose your eating window?How long should the fasting take each day? How long should the feasting take? Better yet, each of these should take place when?To effectively answer these questions, a number of things should be taken into account.When is the workout?Firstly, consider when the workout you are engaging in takes place.It should be a must to consume meals after a period of workoutsince at this juncture the body is quite sensitive to taking in the nutrients it is being fed. Thus, you will be in a better position to have these nutrients stored in your muscle cells as compared to fat cells.If you eat at this period, you will be making a quick recovery in between the workout sessions; very imperative if you want great results. Whatever time you choose to start your workout during the day, ensure it is within the fasting window. How good are you dealing with hunger?Secondly, it is important to think about how good you are dealing with hunger/fast. In case you are not really getting very hungry while in the fasting period, something that happens to many, a longer eating and a short fasting period is the best approach to stick to.Do not think that these ideals are cast into stone. You should be able to adjust them as per the personal preferences you have in place.You will find a 16/8 hour type of eating or fasting split will work just fine,just like a 20/4 hour one, in case you would like to keep fasting most of the time.Are you able to abstain from breakfast with ease?The final thing you can ask yourself while deciding the right moment to engage in an eating phase is whether you are able to relinquish breakfast easily. It is hard for some people to wake up and forgo their sacred breakfast. For them, the end of the fasting period is best done with breakfast, meaning the start of it must begin with a meal or even two prior to going to bed.The approach might befasting from 8am until 9pm or even 10 in the evening.

Raith was successful in her attempt to take over the country of Cymosa, but the Queen and her children managed to escape. Years later, Queen Sarah has vanished in a plane crash, and the heir, Lora is living under a false identity in another country, while Richie is under the control of an evil Uncle. When Raith makes a bid to get the remaining two nations fighting, Lora undertakes the adventure of a lifetime to save her brother, her best friend and new friend, along with the rest of the world, in S. P. Meijer's fantasy epic adventure.Lost heir's are a dime a dozen, but Lora is different, she is 16 but packs a powerfulful determination into that body to right the wrongs of the world. You like her from the beginning. Her best friend Stephen is the son of the King of Magoria, although the King doesn't quite like her. S.P. Meijer focuses on the kids, they are the heros of the book, they are the ones who get out there and make things happen. It's not the King or The Queen or any adult, although at times they help a bit, but it is mainly a group of 16 to 10 year old kids. That is what makes The Heir to The Amulet so good for kids to read. It gives them a sense of empowerment and encouragement, that they aren't too small and their voice matters.\" -Reviewed by Michelle Randall for Readers Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 2921984, "title": "The Heir to the Amulet: A New World Fantasy Adventure Novel", "author": "S P Meijer", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The major expansion involves a more complete coverage of basic aspects of mathematics that continue to play an increasingly significant role in the literature of econometrics. Thus, the chapter on difference equations has been expanded to include enhanced treatment of lag operators (backward shift operators in the statistical literature) that are important not only in the context of the dynamic simultaneous equation GLSEM (general linear structural econometric model), but also time series analysis. New features in this edition include chapters on probability theory and the probabilistic basis of classical econometrics. There is a lengthy chapter on matrix algebra, which takes the reader from the most elementary aspects to the partitioned inverses, characteristic roots and vectors, symmetric, and orthogonal and positive (semi) definite matrices. The book also covers pseudo-inverses, solutions to systems of linear equations, solutions of vector difference equations with constant coefficients and random forcing functions, matrix differentiation, and permutation matrices. Its novel features include an introduction to asymptotic expansions, and examples of applications to the general-linear model (regression) and the general linear structural econometric model (simultaneous equations). Also unique to this edition are two fairly extensive chapters on applications to the GLM (general linear model), GLSEM and time series analysis which treat issues relevant to their underlying theoretical bases, estimation and forecasting.Professor Dhrymes is currently Professor of Economics at Columbia University. Earlier he taught at Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, University of California at Los Angeles, and Monash University in Australia. He is a fellow of the Econometric Society and the American Statistical Association. He has been a managing editor and editor of theInternationalEconomic Review, and one of the founding editors of theJournal of Econometrics. Professor Dhrymes serves on the Editorial Advisory Boards of theJournal of EconometricsandEconometric Theory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It plays with several genres whilst maintaining its paranormal and romantic elements, yet it oozes an edge of horror and thriller. Eli has been quite clever how she has developed the plot to suit such a wide range of tastes.The characters had such a believable and honest relationship, it's impossible NOT to feel something towards them. That goes for the good AND the bad.Because there are bad characters, evil but with something in them that you simply can't hate them for being bad. Mostly I felt empathy and understanding, and yeah, okay, I got a little pissy at them too at times, but hey, here's a mother and daughter quite happily going on with their lives. Sure they have a complicated yet understandably mature relationship with each other, but they are happy nonetheless, then along comes Mikolas and turns their world upside down and sends them down a long deep tunnel into another word that they never knew existed.It's a beautiful story, which chilled me and yet let me soak up its sensuality with every character.As usual, Eli Constant did not fail in writing a story which is both fascinating and realistic whilst still holding its paranormal charm.Well done, high stars!\"Claire C.

What's ironic is that he's well aware of this and has always known that he needed to do something about it. It's embarrassing when you can't have anyone come to your home nor even go shopping with you. It's just not attractive. But when accumulating things with no organization begins to even push your own self away from you, if that makes any sense, it's time to simplify all areas of your life immediately. If you are like this in one area, you are most likely the same in other areas as well. Henry knew it had to start with him because some of his friends had already come to his home to get rid of things for him and organize what they could. But he couldn't maintain it even for two weeks and went right back to his old ways again. That's why he believes that your own mindset change, which is not something that someone else can do for you, is where it begins to start seeing the beauty of a simple life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Professionally, Rishi heads sales and marketing for a financial services multinational. It’s a good gig – his awesome teams do all the work and he shows up to take the credit. Prior to this, he spent years dozing his way up to a super duper senior position at a fine global bank, which ironically never sleeps. His other professional claims to fame include running football betting syndicates in Spain and setting up random internet businesses that contributed to the dotcom bust. Academically, he perfected the art of cracking exams without attending classes at the Cathedral & John Connon School, University of Rochester and Cornell University. Athletically, the dude completes half marathons (21 km for the sportingly ignorant) in well under three hours. To put this speed in perspective, the rate of continental drift is four cms per year: landmasses take 500,000 years to cover the distance that he can in barely a few hours. To put this time in perspective, the Mohenjo-daro and Harappa baloney that they taught us in school is 5,000 years old. So it’s no wonder that champion distance- running nations like Kenya and Ethiopia are clamoring to give him citizenship. Physically, he is a lot more handsome than his photograph suggests. His chiseled Greek God features actually manifest themselves a lot better in oil portraits. Financially, everything that he invests in, depreciates. He is credited with pioneering what is now widely known as the à la carte investment strategy, because it is so damned contrary to what Buffet does. Recreationally, he enjoys texting and will be happy to communicate with you.

Growing up I used to fall asleep listening to CBS Radio Mystery Theater and spent Saturday afternoons watching Creature Double Feature on WLVI, channel 56. Also, I collected comics and ended up doing my master's thesis (\"How Green Is Your Power Ring?\") on the structure of the modern, American superhero comic book. My mother is a published poet and my father a world-class educator. I caught the \"writing bug\" from them at a very early age. I can remember scrawling short stories on scraps of paper in my bedroom late at night when I was supposed to be asleep. My old job allowed me to travel the world. I have been to the Great Wall of China, Angkor Wat, the Taj Mahal, the Sahara Desert, Machu Picchu and countless other spots in Asia, Africa and South America. I have also traveled extensively throughout the United States and am, once again, living in the Colorado Rockies. I have been inspired by both my travels and all the people I've met and worked with along the way. My family and friends have encouraged me over the years to make a living as a writer. I am now taking on the challenge of following my bliss.

For those coming to serious study of the Bible for the first time, there cannot be any more important lesson than to understand how to read the Bible's ancient historical records faithfully on their own terms. They are not always the same as ours. You will not find a better or more sympathetic introductory book than this one to point you in the right direction.\"--H. G. M. Williamson, University of Oxford\"This is a book about the ancient biblical historical books for readers in the text-message age! Engagingly written, it goes beyond matters of introduction, to show how an appreciation of the factors of historical context, storytelling, point of view, and overarching concept play a crucial role for readers in their understanding of the text. Always sympathetically aware of its audiences, and with panels calling for reader involvement, this book will be an invaluable aid to all who have a serious interest in understanding these rich story-histories of the Old Testament.\"--J. Gordon McConville, University of Gloucestershire\"Finally, an accessible work that reunites the literary and historical aspects of the Old Testament historical books and trains contemporary readers to hear the text in responsible ways that can shape the course of life today.\"--Mark J. Boda, McMaster Divinity College and McMaster University\"This engaging guide to reading historical narrative in the Old Testament is a great text for beginners. Dutcher-Walls assumes little and draws on a wide variety of relevant texts and illustrations from the Bible, ancient Near Eastern sources, and especially modern historical texts and media contexts. There is nothing better for communicating basic principles of Hebrew Bible historiography to modern readers.\"--Richard S.

You know how those Alpha men can be!You will find several difference between the series. The most noticable is probably the word count. All of the Shifter Chronicles books will be novel length, over 50k, and be released in both EBook and Print format.The two series will have seperate plot and story outlines. This is so you do not have to read both series or go in order to keep up. The Shifter Chronciles is it's own series even if the main three characters where introduced in Book nine of the Were Chronicles: Pack Council.I really hope you enjoy each title you pick up of mine. These heart warming, funny, crazy, shifters are meant to entertain.", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
