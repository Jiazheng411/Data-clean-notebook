Son of a London bookie, husband of a Swedish beauty and owner of an enviable stable of horses, Edward de Jersey is also the retired mastermind of one of Britain's most famous unsolved robberies, a man who would rather die than give up his life of privilege. Step by step, he plans, prepares and executes a modern version of the Great Train Robbery, overcoming computerized security systems and penetrating royal protocol. De Jersey brutally dispenses enemies and boldly protects friends on both sides of the Atlantic, but it is his team of accomplices that makes this classic crime caper a compelling read, among them Pamela, the ex-con television actress; Lord Westbrook, the disgraced palace equerry; and Marsh, the computer whiz turned crook. La Plante's knowledge of the sport of kings, her sense of irony in human relationships and her deceptively cool narrative style allow her to visit familiar crime fiction territory with aplomb. She does not create the equal of herMasterpiece Theatredetective Jane Tennison, but she weaves an intricate story of crime and character that starts off slowly and then keeps the reader guessing as it gallops to a photo finish.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rather, the author helps readers delve into their personal histories to discover what turns them on (and off) and how to communicate these revelations to a partner. Bogart, a lecturer and professor, employs worksheets, charts, quizzes and checklists as prompts for readers to reflect on past sexual experiences and to describe what worked and what didn't; these self-assessment questions range from \"Describe your first kissing experience\" to selecting a response that best describes the reader's views on group sex, role-playing and watching pornography. Bogart dishes advice alongside whimsical illustrations depicting body parts and techniques (such as \"Using a dental dam\") and testimonials from individuals of all ages, genders and sexual orientations. It's clear from chapter titles such as \"A Penile Pilgrimage\" and \"Voyage to the Land of Vulvas and Vaginas\" that Bogart considers sex a journey, rather than something to be conquered or achieved, and this book is a viable road map for curious explorers in search of uncharted sexual terrain.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The publicity and a winning streak soon result in full stands at all of the games.

When the attention goes to his head, Koby forgets all about teamwork, loses a game, almost loses his friends, and nearly blows the conference championship.

She was about to speak when the roar of ambulance sirens screamed in the background. Once they were no longer within earshot, she turned away from the devastating murder-suicide scene in front of her on a balmy afternoon in early July.Lance smiled as he looked through the lens. Ciara was breathtaking. He was captivated by her smooth bronze skin, brilliant hazel eyes, full lips and defiant chin. Ciara had a way of seducing the camera with her delicately carved features and exotically high cheekbones. The honey-blond hair surrounding her ovalshaped face only added to her allure. The new hair color was daring but not too bold as to offend viewers. She'd said she wanted to make a statement, and that she had. Ciara was always the epitome of fashion and today was no exception. She was wearing killer-red Prada pumps, a slim black skirt and a vibrant red silk blouse.He'd known Ciara for the last five years since they'd both begun working at WTCF fresh out of college. Barely making minimum wage, they'd been paired together and had instantly developed a rapport. Their long hours and grunt work had paid off as they'd steadily moved their way up the newsroom ladder. Ciara was now a staff reporter and Lance an assistant photographer, but Ciara had bigger dreams and he knew she would achieve them; the girl had tenacity.Lance gave her a thumbs-up signal, lifted the camera on his shoulder and directed it her way. Poised and ready for battle, Ciara gave the on-screen intro to her package for the second block of the five o'clock news.\"The scene here today turned deadly for a young wife and mother,\" Ciara said as the camera focused in on the Spanish-style home that now served as a crime scene. \"Hector Rodriguez accused his wife of infidelity and then turned the gun on her and then himself late yesterday evening. Witnesses say that Mrs. Rodriguez came home yesterday to discover her husband enraged after she was late coming home from work. Neighbors say they heard loud voices before hearing gunshots.Authorities indicate that Hector Rodriguez trashed the home in a jealous rage before shooting himself and his wife. Detectives indicate that a full investigation will take place. This is Ciara Miller reporting for WTCFFOX News.\" Ciara smiled into the camera.\"How was I?\" she asked, batting her long curly eyelashes at her best friend and coworker. She absolutely adored Lance. He knew her inside and out. She could always be real with him. It was a shame he was so darn smart and good-looking, and with that athletic physique she could eat him up with a spoon. \"Unh, unh, unh, unh,\" Ciara murmured, shaking her head. But she couldn't go there, they'd decided a long time ago that they'd rather have a platonic relationship than ruin a great friendship.\"Beautiful as always,\" Lance replied, turning off the camera and closing the lens cover. \"And you know that.\" He set the camera inside the open OB truck that he used to send live feeds back to the newsroom.\"Yeah, I do,\" Ciara said grinning, \"but a little praise never hurt.\" She watched the medical examiner's van drive away as the police secured the perimeter of the crime scene.Lance wrapped the cord around his arm and walked it back to the truck. \"Since when do you need to be told you're fabulous? You know you've got what it takes.\"\"Have you told that to Shannon recently?\" Ciara asked. \"Because she won't give me a break. She keeps sending me out for lightweight entertainment stories. Today was the first time I've gotten to report breaking news.\"Ciara had tried for months to convince WTCF's new television director, Shannon Wright, that she was more than a pretty face, to no avail. Had Shannon even looked at her résumé?She'd been at the top of her class at Johns Hopkins and had obtained a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University. She'd worked at Columbia's television station, theColumbia Daily Spectatorand the yearbook. She was a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and had worked at the station for over five years. She'd started out as a production assistant before moving on to become a general assignment reporter.Ciara excelled at pushing herself. So what if that interfered with her cultivating lasting personal relationships; she was willing to make the sacrifice to get to the top of the heap. Her looks wouldn't last forever. Talent was the key.\"You'll have your day,\" Lance said. \"You just have to be patient.\"\"As you well know, patience is not one of my virtues,\" Ciara replied.\"Ain't that the truth,\" Lance laughed, opening the passenger side. \"You'd better get in. I've got to get back and edit the footage.\"Ciara hopped up in the van and buckled her seat belt while he closed the door. Lance may have thought that was the end of it, but Ciara had other ideas.\"Now is not the right time for me to announce my candidacy,\" Jonathan Butler said to his father, Congressman Charles Butler, and Reid Hamilton, his father's chief of staff and personal adviser. They were in his father's office strategizing on Jonathan's campaign while his father paced the floor reciting the speech he was going to give to the press the following day. \"I should let you step down first. I don't want to appear overly zealous.\"Charles smiled as he watched his son. Admiration shone through in his oval-shaped brown eyes at his son's stately presence. Six foot three with massive shoulders, his son towered over other men, including him. He carried himself with the same dignity and grace that Charles had conveyed during his twentyfive-year tenure serving the good people of Philadelphia. He had a bright future ahead of him and had done the right thing starting off in law before becoming an alderman. Charles was sure that Jonathan would be as capable a leader as he was. It was just a shame that he had to step down because of a heart condition.\"Why not announce it at your father's retirement press conference tomorrow? It would be a prime opportunity with maximum coverage,\" Reid replied.\"I agree with Reid,\" his father said. \"Capitol Hill has been rumoring for months that you'll take over my seat. Why not end all the speculation?\" Charles was sure the press would be eager to meet his handsome, dark-haired son.\"How would it appear to the public if I announced my candidacy directly after your speech? It would show a complete lack of respect for what a wonderful congressman you've been. The public would see me as a capitalist.\"\"There will never be a right time,\" Charles Butler returned.\"That may be true, Dad, but now is definitely not it. I haven't even hired a campaign manager or a media consultant.\" He'd done some preliminary legwork by getting an office, but there was still more to be done.Jonathan saw the shocked expression on Reid's face. Reid must have assumed that because he served as his father's campaign manager that he was the logical choice for Jonathan. Jonathan, however, had other ideas. He appreciated Reid's input thus far, but he wanted someone he knew and trusted leading his campaign, and his best friend, Zach Powers, was just that man.Jonathan intended to speak with Zach over lunch. Zach had just finished a successful campaign with Governor Green and Jonathan was sure Zach could do the same for him.\"I'm sorry, Reid.\" Jonathan folded his arms across his chest. \"I meant to speak with you. I hope there are no hard feelings?\" Jonathan extended his right hand.\"No, not at all.\" Reid returned the handshake and faked a smile.His father spoke up on Reid's behalf. \"Jonathan…\" \"It's okay, Charles,\" Reid interrupted him. \"If Jonathan wants to hire his own right hand, leave him be.\"\"No, it's not fair,\" Charles Butler huffed. \"You're practically a member of this family. Jonathan, why would you even think of going with a stranger?\" \"Dad, I've made my choice and I don't intend on arguing about this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few items to attend to.\" Jonathan grabbed his overcoat and leather briefcase sitting on the floor and headed out the door.Once the door closed, Charles faced his best friend and closest adviser. \"Don't worry, Reid. I'll talk to him.\"\"Don't bother,\" Reid said. \"If your son feels he can find a better man to lead his team then by all means let him.\"\"Thank you for understanding.\" Charles patted Reid's back and walked back to his desk.\"No problem,\" Reid said and grabbed the folder of notes he'd previously prepared on Jonathan's campaign and walked to the door. \"I'll leave you to your speech.\" Reid closed the door behind himself.Livid, he stalked back to his office and shut the door. He slammed the file on his maple desk and plopped down in his swivel chair.How dare that two-bit snot disrespect him in such a manner? After everything he had done for the Butler family, after all the hours he'd spent, the personal sacrifices he'd made and Jonathan dared hire another manager? Who did he think had helped Charles get elected? Reid was responsible for Charles Butler's successful twenty-five-year run in Congress every bit as much as the man himself.Reid knew the ins and outs of politics more than most. He'd had over thirty years in the business. He'd run all of Charles Butler's campaigns and won every single one of them. Jonathan had no idea what it took to win an election. What he needed was to be taught a lesson—he couldn't mess with a real man. Reid would show him that he would not be tossed away like the gum on the bottom of his preppy-boy shoe.Oh yes, Reid mused, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. Jonathan Butler was in for a rude awakening.", "related": ["B00D1B4CTA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since her explosion into syndication in 1998, Hax has revolutionized the advice column by giving in-depth, ruthlessly practical, sometimes controversial, often coffee-up-your-nose funny advice that also happens to be really good.Hax has an uncanny ability to see through what people are saying to the real issue: who they are, what they're doing and why. Then, instead of telling readers what to do, she offers them new ways to think, so they can find for themselves the solutions that best meet their individual needs. Since 1998, Hax has conducted weekly live discussions on washingtonpost.com. These spirited forums are the most popular on the site and last over two hours - twice the usual length - both to allow her to maintain the depth and quality of the advice and to accommodate the extensive back-and-forth with readers. Hax's columns are edited and illustrated by, of all people, her ex-husband, Nick Galifianakis - proving that exes can not only get along, but also work well together, probably because they have too much dirt on each other not to.Hax is a Harvard graduate, a married mother of three (including a set of twins), and a shoe \"aficionado\" (addict). She has worked at The Washington Post since 1992 and has been in the news business since 1989 as an editor, freelance writer and full-time columnist. Hax lives in the Washington, D.C., area and her first book with Galifianakis, \"Tell Me About It: Lying, Sulking, Getting Fat ... and 56 Other Things Not to Do While Looking for Love,\" was published in 2001 by Hyperion.Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

When war serves as a filter for reality, the fiction it produces often tends toward the surreal and absurd, or lapses into manifesto and rhetoric. With pronounced sensitivity and insight, Mustafa, a native Iraqi and professor of Arabic at Boston University, has perceptively gathered and luminously translated an unparalleled representation of scenes from the current Iraqi experience that instead reflect a refreshing interpretation of modern events. Although expected themes of religious tolerance and diversity, political persecution and tyranny, personal liberation and isolation are prominent, ennobling entries celebrating the universal nature of romantic intimacy, familial love, and childish innocence eloquently attest to the indomitable resiliency of the human spirit. --Carol Haggas", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The \"ideas\" part comes in the \"person\" of Turing, an artificial intelligence program (modeled on computer scientist Alan Turing) that pops up unbidden on PC monitors to deliver a lengthy bits-to-browsers computer tutorial, with lectures thrown in on such topics as intellectual history, cryptography and non-Euclidean geometry. Turing's disquisitions are aimed mostly at Alexandros, a disillusioned leftist slowly coming to embrace the modern cyberworld. Through them, computer scientist Papadimitriou-choosing pedagogy over plot-imparts a humanist gloss to the libertarian futurism of the techno-elite, instructing readers that the free market is the mathematically optimal social arrangement, that the Internet and encryption software are bulwarks of freedom against a useless but heavy-handed state and that the human adventure-indeed, life itself-is coterminous with machine computation. Unfortunately, formatting these ideas as stilted dialogue (\"So, Alexandros, did you understand this new way of categorizing adjectives?\") makes it less, not more, engaging. Still worse is the love story, whose wooden offerings (\"I will never stop loving you.... I know I'll love you after our F2F\") seem designed chiefly to reassure readers that, even as cyberspace replaces sexual identity with \"seamlessly erotic interface code\" as the basis for romance, old saws about soul mates and commitment issues survive. Tech freaks and computer whizzes may love Turing's musings, but mainstream readers won't have patience for all the theory.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The St. Charles Players, composed of four actors, play a variety of roles with hammy gusto, although the dialogue is a bit rushed in the opening sections. This adaptation by Jeff Rack does a good job of capturing the feel of Verne's sprawling epic tale. The story is told by Professor Aronnax, who agrees to investigate a series of attacks by a mysterious sea monster. He joins the crew of the ship Abraham Lincoln. The men encounter what they believe is the monster, but turns out to be a large, state-of-the-art submarine, the Nautilus. Aronnax and a hot tempered harpoonist, Ned Land, are imprisoned on this vessel, captained by the misanthropic recluse, Nemo. Nemo takes them around the world. Verne's descriptions of the underwater world, with its exotic creatures and sunken ships, shine thanks to clear narration and evocative sound effects. As the journey continues, becoming monotonous, the program's midsection sags a bit. It picks up steam again with sequences involving a monstrous octopus and a storm. While not an essential purchase, this is an impressive attempt to adapt a classic.Brian E.

Before immersing again on the Mancat series, Tez published what he considers one of his best pieces: Task Master.

He has commissioned promising artists to portray his characters, create his covers, and illustrate his books.

This innovative polyphonic story brings a unique life to historical events and private lives that blend in a human universe at the same time fascinating and unbearable.\" --Mariano Zaro, PhD, author most recently of The House of Mae Rim / La Casa de Mae RimIn Confined, Mariana Dietl adopts an array of voices to tell the story of a woman named Elena Reyes de Basagalupo, who is locked away in a windowless room by her husband in Argentina circa 1979. The setting corresponds with the height Argentina s Dirty War, which saw over 30,000 people become disappeared as the country s military dictatorship attempted to suppress communist uprisings. Given the grim nature of the subject matter, it s no surprise that Confined is itself a grim, often claustrophobic read. The main action of the novel revolves around Elena s efforts to find comfort even a glimmer of it inside the confines of her cell. Her husband, a mid-level militant, has locked her away and explained her absence from the world at large by telling her family that she has died. The resulting isolation, however, forces Elena to live in a world of memories, and soon she finds herself reconstructing the life that led to her eventual imprisonment. What becomes apparent as she does so is that her imprisonment began long before her husband locked her away. In short, Elena s place in society could only ever be one of servitude and loyalty to her husband, her family, her government, and her church. In addition to the largely omniscient third-person account of Elena s story, Dietl fills in the blanks by inviting other characters to speak their minds on her disappearances. Roughly every-other-chapter consists of an interview with one or more of the people who knew the protagonists in her former life: her parents, her in-laws, the guards who watched over her, and a beloved grandmother, to name just a few. Such chapters are set off by a change in typeface from Times New Roman (or something quite like it) to a sans-serif font. This technique is especially helpful, especially given the absence of chapter headings throughout the novel. Indeed, the novel itself is so densely packed with the voices of various characters and the psychological details of Elena s imprisonment that it s easy to get lost in the proceedings. The effect of this is to put the reader in a position similar to that of Elena: as the details pile up, we become walled in, victims of the overwhelming crush of history, politics, and other forces beyond our control. A dense, harrowing, and at times confounding read, Confined is, nonetheless, a moving book reminiscent of William Gaddis and Reinaldo Arenas. --Marc Schuster, Small Press Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 4279748, "title": "Confined.

The narrator is a middle-aged French author, tall and very Prince of Savoie, as he wryly describes himself, touching down briefly in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Berlin, Prague, and Tunisia for meetings with friends and to attend literary functions. His wife, Madeleine, and two children appear fleetingly, but, mostly, we follow the narrator as he, among other things, holds on for dear life on a motorcycle driven by a tour guide through traffic-choked Hanoi; accompanies a passionate Francophile and skillful go-between to a Japanese strip bar; and befriends two stranded women archeologists in Tunisia, who hitch a ride with him to Sfaz, where he gives a reading of his really rather wonderful books. Toussaint is a love-him or hate-him kind of writer, and this book perfectly illustrates why: there's no plot, and the narrator can be seen as either funny, sharply observant, and perhaps ingeniously ironic, or a clueless, narcissistic windbag.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I am actually putting this together to recognize the beauty and virtue in women. I feel that being a women in today's society, and especially in the past, more so the latter, is very difficult. Women have faced a great deal of injustices and cruelties at the hands of our countries crude and callus constraints. I do recognize that! There has also been a great deal of progress that has been made, due to the contribution of the women in this country, and they are truly one of the strongest pillars of the foundation of the world. Throughout my professional career I have been blessed with the opportunity to work in environments where women predominate. I must say that I've learned a great deal from being around them, such as women's feelings, how they react to certain stimuli, or should I say certain situations. Strangely enough, it surprised me how so similar they are to men, believe it or not! Yes, men and women are very different, but we really have a lot in common. Of course, we don't express it in the same fashion, but the feelings are very much the same. During my career as a licensed cosmetologist, I have had the opportunity to talk with several women about there lives and relationships; they all have very different situations and scenarios, but they all agreed on one point. They agreed that it is so easy to be a man. Men are so simple and predictable, and even easy to please. Well that is a huge misconception!!!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Belle is no longer the rebellious, impulsive girl she was when, pregnant and in disgrace, she left her family's Ohio farm to fend for herself in New York. Now hardened by the years, Belle returns to retrieve her daughter, Sarah, from her stiffly proper mother, Lillian, and her once-adored stepbrother Rand-Sarah's father. Belle's unexpected appearance unleashes an onslaught of emotions in Rand and Lillian, who have been working the land in respectful amity, dutifully raising young Sarah, the focus of a parental battle of wills. Feeling renewed by her return to her home, Belle rediscovers the joys of Midwestern life even though the gossipy townsfolk circulate rumors about her bellying up to the bar with the boys for a round of poker and living under the same roof as Rand. She and Rand each fight against not only the fierce longing they both fear and desire but also years of shame and regret. Ardently executed, this is a story deftly told.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1071115, "title": "After the Frost", "author": "Megan Chance", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When her father accepts a one-year position at the University of York, homesick Jess endures the misery of hearing herself labeled the \"stuck-up American\" in her new school. From this realistic opening, the novel soon plunges into the realm of fantasy. Jess seeks to solve one of the most famous murders in history with help from the victims, whose spirits speak to her from the stained-glass windows that hold them captive. With two newfound English friends, Jess and her brothers discover who really murdered the princes in the Tower, why their spirits rest uneasily, and how to help them find peace. While an element of melodrama detracts from the climax, readers will find the characterizations subtle and satisfying overall. As in her first novel,The Ghost Cadet(1991), Alphin weaves elements of history and fantasy into an entertaining, modern-day adventure story.Carolyn Phelan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Currently, she splits time between San Francisco and California's Central Coast with her husband, Matt and flat-coated retriever, Burton. When she's not writing, however, she enjoys rooting for her beloved Yankees, taking her dog to the beach and sailing. For more information about Devina or her novels, please check out her website at devinadouglas.com", "related": ["B001DQYE2K"], "rank": 2241434, "title": "All The Little Pieces", "author": "Devina Douglas", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Islet Abandoned is a gritty, dirty and at times a bit uncomfortable read. Ms. Trent's vision of the future is a bleak world where all seems lost. The highlight of this story is the spunkiness of Islet, who has a mouth like a truck driver and is very tenacious. Darrin may be a different type of creature, a mutant from the nuclear fallout, but he has manners and is a stoic individual. The way he treats Islet is respectful yet he also uses a heavy hand. His hands-on techniques may be a bit cold and for some readers, borderline rape, but I felt it fit for the tone of the story. Even with those semi-shocking sex scenes, Ms. Trent allows the reader into the mind of both Islet and Darrin and shows why this exchange between them must be doneKate Garrabrant for Just Erotic Romance ReviewsIf you're looking for candlelight, wine and roses, then it's time to take a detour.

Saxton has authored four books, Dancing with the Moon, Beckon, Into the Second Springtime, and Pirate Moon. She is currently working on her fifth novel. June Marie recently worked with her father, Dale B. Weston, on his first historical novel, Whirlwind on the Outlaw Trail. The father and daughter duo often called to read to each other what they had written. Dale was very encouraging of June Marie's efforts in Pirate Moon, and vice-versa. The two planned on a book signing tour together in the fall. \"It was fun working on our books together\" Saxton said. \"It was quite exhilarating, and I was so proud of Dad for trying something new to him\" The joy of their shared enterprise ended when Dale suddenly passed away in March. June Marie was left with his manuscript, and she edited, polished, and worked it until it was publication ready-until she felt that Dale's wishes were carried out, and his concerns addressed. \"There were moments of sorrow and moments of joy, but working on my father's book has been the most profound experience of my life, aside from motherhood. I also finished the last four chapters of Pirate Moon during the same time period, mourning the fact that Dad wouldn't get to hear how my book ended. He had been one hundred percent invested into the story before then. Because I was feeling so much emotion, however, I think that it transferred onto the written page, giving myself hope of happy endings, and bright horizons that extend beyond mortality. Hopefully that translates to readers, as well\" June Marie continues to work as a nutritional consultant at Bear Necessities of Montpelier. She has recently become a grandmother to beautiful Kynleigh. Saxton hopes to spoil her, and future grandchildren, and also to write many more books. Her hobbies include anything to do with her family, being a rancher's wife, and daydreaming.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Part 3, on \"The Nature of Basic Ego-Weakness\", seeks to assess fully the importance of Winnicott's research into the earliest beginnings of ego development, as the infant slowly grows into psychic separation from the mother, a process that involves both the opportunity for individuation and also the risk of loss of relationship, as well as the risk of possibly permanent stunting of the ego development instead of growth of basic ego relatedness in the mentally healthy person.Part 4 explores the implications for psychotherapy of the study of the schizoid problem, particularly in the matter of the personal therapeutic relationship of therapist and patient. And finally, in Part 5, the review of theory is put on a broad foundation with a chapter on \"The Concept of Psychodynamic Science\" and another comparing the ego theories of Hartmann and the \"object-relational\" thinkers, Melanie Klein, Fairbairn, and Winnicott.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In other words, it's a read rougher than 16-grit sandpaper. Wiley, an unemployed poker player of Hawaiian extraction and the brightest light in this murky world, considers abandoning such dealings to coach high-school hoops-- until unfinished business drags him back into the Portland, Oregon, gutters. This time he's gunning for Dookie, a stylishly crazy pimp who's abducted a call girl whom Wiley rescued once before. (The actor Ving Rhames should file a patent-infringement case against Dookie, who takes his thoughtful thug act to a dangerous new level.) This second novel in the series tends to fixate on events of the first, especially the murder of Wiley's daughter. That's understandable but makes getting into the tale a bit difficult for newcomers. Thankfully, crackling dialogue and explosively entertaining characters make the effort worthwhile.Frank SennettCopyright © American Library Association.

She was born into a blue-blooded family of achievers and in early life was inspired by her mother, who was an independent-minded woman, who travelled extensively with her highly placed husband and took an active interest in public affairs along with him.Emily grew up to be a versatile and gifted woman and became a successful novelist, a painter and a writer of a book entitled \"Up the Country\" (pub. 1866) that described through her letters, her journey with her brother and his retinue, from Kolkata to Shimla. Besides \"Up the Country\" she wrote two novels \"The Semi-Detached House\" (1859) and \"The Semi-Attached Couple\" (1860). All of her books were received well by the reading public.But it is as a painter that she is being re-introduced to the public consciousness through the current exhibition. J. Dickinson published her paintings for the first time in 1844 in a collection called \"Princes and People of India\". Her paintings were executed in watercolour and depicted, as the title suggests, the entire cross-section of Indian society of that day: at least to the extent of her knowledge. Twenty-three sketches of Ms. Eden were published in that volume as lithographs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this short story, Doug and Ellen, a well-to-do couple with a new baby, decide to take an overdue vacation on Martha's Vineyard. The delayed respite is due to an indiscretion on Doug's part, which Ellen can't seem to find it in her heart to forgive. Maybe this time away will afford her some new perspective; maybe there's hope for their marriage after all?

Writing of stultifying schools, the author argues that slum children in the South Bronx need ``protection from education.'' He endorses ``eloquent silence'' as a means to protest the nuclear arms race. Cranky, retrograde, utopian ideas mark these exercises in radical eco-chic that often compare our dehumanized industrial world with 12th-century Europe, which, in Illich's romanticized view, protected the poor, encouraged local autonomy and ensured access to water, pasture, woods and livestock. He stimulates and challenges in pieces on education and living space as social constructs, the machine-like behavior of people chained to electronic devices and a cultural/mythic history of water.

While I am also drawn to Hodgson's account of free will, there still seems to me to be a persistent mystery in the pure agency that must be at the heart of any incompatibilist account. But Hodgson has certainly shown how this element can be located in a complex system with other, traditionally causal factors. The book ends with reflections on the Big Picture of our place in the universe that is consonant with his theory of consciousness and free will. I am very happy to find in his writings the clear and convincing expression of an outlook that seems so right.\"--Thomas Nagel, New York University\"Theorists concerned with the role of consciousness in human judgment and action production or in event-causal libertarianism will no doubt find much of interest in Hodgson's latest book.\"--Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\"David Hodgson is a distinguished jurist as well as a philosopher of considerable depth and breadth. In this book he develops an innovative account of plausible reasoning which cannot be wholly accounted for in terms of algorithmic rules and an equally innovative account of consciousness, which he argues can affect reasoning and decision-making in ways that cannot be fully accounted for in terms of laws of nature. These ideas are then employed in the development of an original account of free will of an indeterministic event-causal kind; and they are applied perceptively to a wide range of other important philosophical topics, including rationality, responsibility, value, morality, law and criminal punishment. The book is written with admirable clarity and is informed by knowledge of quantum physics and contemporary neuroscience as well as of philosophy. It should be read by anyone interested in current debates about free will.\" --Robert Kane, University of Texas at Austin\"... a thoughtful and lucidly composed set of reflections on consciousness, free will, and the retributive justification of punishment, which together form a coherent and in certain respects original position of philosophical importance.\" --Derk Pereboom, Cornell University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He also conducts fiction workshops throughout the area and contributed to Now Write! Mysteries (Tarcher/Penguin, 2011).   He was born and raised in Saginaw, Michigan, where he read Hemingway, Lardner, Fitzgerald, and Sherwood Anderson, the local talent that helped shape his voice.  He also devoured Sherlock Holmes and The Hardy Boys, writing his first mystery when he was ten.  His mother typed it for him; when he saw his name in print for the first time, he knew that he wanted to be a writer.  His ninth-grade English teacher was the sister of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke, so there was no going back.   At Oakland University, he tempered his English major with moonlighting as a DJ on the campus radio station and playing bass in a band.  He started out as a British Invasion fan, but fell in love with blues after seeing the Muddy Waters Band open for Martha and the Vandellas. His family moved to Connecticut while he was in college, and, since there were no teaching jobs in Michigan, he joined them after graduation. He taught English in New Britain and drifted into theater, where he directed, produced, designed, and acted in nearly 90 community theater productions.  He also earned an MALS and CAS in literature from Wesleyan University and a Masters plus sixty in literature and theater.   He has published several short stories, twice winning Honorable Mention for the Al Blanchard Award. “Stranglehold” appeared in Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine after winning the Black Orchid Novella Award for 2009, and Lee Child selected “Hot Sugar Blues” for inclusion in Vengeance, an MWA anthology coming in spring of 2012.

Nora brings a unique voice to the mental health book world because she writes of the unfolding of her \"personalities\" as they happen; she discovers her inner world much like that of the reader, day by day, page by page. Nora graduated from University of Wisconsin-Stout with a Masters in Counseling with a focus on Mental Health and worked several years for a nonprofit, consumer run organization for individuals with mental health concerns. Today, Nora spends her time creating through writing, drawing, knitting, and whatever the parts want to try. Nora works part time for disabled individuals in their homes.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am currently filming the Arched Wing Series as movies. I hope that everyone who loves the book will love the movie.I am also working on some other novels to share. I love to write and I dive into all genres with a twist of romance in them. I think that a writer should not be limited to simply a single genre; unless they choose to only write one genre, but instead that a writer should be willing to explore new reaches. I write for myself and not to impress any readers. I enjoy what I do, so hopefully you'll enjoy my works as well.Commonly Ask Questions from the Readers1.Which brother would you choose? Falcon or Dru?ANSWER: Honestly, the only way you can get an answer to that question is to finish the series, you never know what will happen in Arched Wing.2. Why did you choose New York State and Washington State? Was it because of Twilight?ANSWER: No, it had nothing to do with Twilight, I was fourteen when I started writing Arched Wing and Twilight is younger than that. I went back and added Twilight references when it became huge. I chose Washington because I am from Washington, and I chose New York as a special nod to Sweep Series by Tiernan because she is the reason I decided to get into writing about Wicca.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Richard was educated at Harrow School, and was to study law. However, his highly romantic elopement with Elizabeth Linley put paid to such hopes. His first play, The Rivals, produced at Covent Garden in 1775, was a failure on its first night. Sheridan cast a more capable actor for the role of the comic Irishman for its second performance, and it was a smash which immediately established the young playwright’s reputation. It has gone on to become a standard of English literature. His most famous play School for Scandal (1777) is considered one of the greatest comedies of manners in English. It was followed by The Critic (1779), an updating of the satirical restoration play The Rehearsal. He was also a Whig politician, entering parliament in 1780. A great public speaker, he remained in parliament until 1812, and was a leading figure in the party. Amongst his other works are St. Patrick’s Day; or, The Scheming Lieutenant (1775), The Duenna (1775), Scarborough and the Critic (1777) and School for Scandal (1777).", "related": ["B002RHORHQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If there's any justice, it should put an immediate end to all those incomprehensible menus, absurd claims about the 'art' of cooking, and to chips inexplicably served in beakers.' -- James Walton Spectator", "related": [], "rank": 2143852, "title": "You Aren't What You Eat: fed up with gastroculture", "author": "Steven Poole", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She got great pleasure putting the pen to paper, and telling stories about children and animals.  Their innocence and ability to give love without asking for anything in return, proved to her there was something good in the world... something that made all the struggles worth it.        Being very modest and humble, Jolene found that the one subject she had problems with was writing about herself.  That was where Brandy came in.  The loveable Cockapoo gave her a way to tell about her amazing road back to recovery, without the drudgery.  All of a sudden, she was able to pour her heart out, recapping the highs and lows through her \"Therapy Dog's\" eyes.        Jolene has lived the last 14 years in Southwest Florida, with her husband, Scott.  She enjoys Gardening, Scrap Booking, Singing Karaoke, and spending time with friends.  Both she and her husband enjoy the laid-back lifestyle, and doing what they can to help each other make each moment count!

You were not there; you were performing in New York at the Metropolitan Opera. If you had been at home, you might have saved him. But you were not there. That's the beginning of this terrific novel from Toronto's Rick Blechta.Blechta is a master storyteller who writes with a musical touch . . . [He] writes entertaining, well-researched stories with dialogue and setting as highlights. InThe Fallen One, Blechta has kicked it up a notch.Blechta combines the skills of a cozy writer – sharp characters, good food, lots of scenic travel – with the skills of a suspense writer.  It's a nice mix.  Marta is a terrific and well realized character – I recommend making her acquaintance.. . . what’s best about The Fallen One is Blechta's informed grasp of the opera milieu. Any reader who begins the book not knowing much about an entertainment in which fat ladies sing will finish it with enough knowledge to qualify as a commentator on Saturday-afternoon broadcasts from the Met.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She finds herself the proud owner of her mother’s childhood home after the death of her estranged grandmother. Together with her unstable mother and little brother, Billie leaves London for the Seaton coastline, a veritable ghost town in the winter months—an apt comparison given that her grandmother, uncle, and her birth father haunt Billie’s memories. However, her search for her past is sidetracked by an urgent romance with Danny, a local boy she quickly falls in love with. Yet the narrative doesn’t solely belong to Billie; the perspective shifts to her mother, grandmother, and assorted others throughout the telling, shuttling back and forth in time. While it reads quickly enough to appeal to reluctant readers, Nadin’s novel is also quite mature and nuanced in its building of relationships. While some of the curves at the end might not be so surprising, this is a stirring, elegant, and winning effort.

When contextual differences are made explicit, however, as they are in the discussion of presentations and vivas towards the end of the book, the advice that Gray gives is invaluable.

He has the penetrating faculty of describing each tree while never losing sight of the wood. -- Matthew Parris, Times columnist, BBC broadcaster and former MP [Shepherd] has written an entertaining life of the village that spins on its own axis. -- Caroline Shenton The Spectator Well researched ... the book is at its best [when the] narrative is leavened with surprising anecdotes. The Sunday Times 20121028 Westminster has developed a most distinct personality since its birth as a swampy Bronze Age island, and Shepherd explains, describes and charts it with great scholarship, of course, but with a smile and a quizzical eyebrow.

He started his first business at the age of ten, placing video games in retail outlets such as pizza shops, restaurants, bars, and cafes for a friend of his father. The late 1970's were a great time for people in the video gaming business, and Sandro was paid $50 for each placement he made: big money back then, especially for one so young in business. Somehow, Sandro spotted the top of the market, took his profits, and moved to a more lucrative hobby and business: collecting comic books. But that was then. Having founded and built up several successful businesses since, he now describes himself as a \"recovering\" CEO of a publicly traded food service company in Mexico. Sandro has introduced a number of U.S. brands to Mexico, and helped to build them to multi-million dollar brands: including Miller Beer, Thrifty Ice Cream, Roma Food, and Rockstar Energy Drinks. He sits on several corporate boards, advising on issues such as trademark and labeling requirements. He presently works with clients including Little Caesars Pizza, Queso Nery's, Nery's Logistics, and 5-hour Energy. Since 1998, he has generated well over $500 million dollars in sales and profits for his clients and partners, helping them export their products into Mexico. He works long and hard to make sure that his clients, and their products, move to market as quickly and smoothly as possible with no problems 50 and the highest profits. You see, in his own businesses he's made all the mistakes that could possibly have been made in transitioning from the United States to Mexico. He's had product stopped at the Mexican border because the paperwork was fouled up. But only once. He's seen his product sales hit by unfair competition issues inside Mexico. But only once. Every time he's made a mistake, he's learned from it. It's this experience, a dedication to great customer care, and an attitude of providing flawless execution of tasks that he not only brings to Mexico Sales Made Easy, but also instills in all his staff.

She grew up in different parts of Nigeria with a brief stint in boarding school in the Nilgiri Hills in India and occasional summers in Kerala, London, and New York. She moved to Ireland at 17 to complete her medical studies and vividly remembers the shock of arriving at Galway Train Station on an icy October night. Despite that traumatic first meeting, she fell in love with Galway and has remained there since, apart from a 3-year episode in the southwest of France. She is an Irish citizen and now considers herself almost Irish as well as almost Indian. She has been writing creatively for years, apart from her period in France where she wrote nothing creative, probably because she was running a restaurant-bar despite having a background in Medicine (she is a qualified medical doctor) and IT (she has a Masters in IT) and absolutely no background in restaurants, apart from eating in them. Her first novel, 'Heart Stopper,' was published in February 2012 and her second novel, 'Falling Colours - The Misadventures of a Vision Painter,' in June 2012. Her third novel, Casting Shadows - The Further Misadventures of a Vision Painter, was published in January 2013. Her novels are set in the West of Ireland, in Galway and Connemara, and also in Kerala, India.  Her story 'Helmets' was shortlisted for the 2011 Over the Edge 'New Writer of the Year Competition' and she was the only entrant to have both her fiction and her poetry long-listed for the Doire Press '1st Annual International Fiction and Poetry Chapbook Competition' in January 2012. Her fiction entry, 'The Vision Painter,' went on to be shortlisted for this competition and was the basis for her second novel, 'Falling Colours - The Misadventures of a Vision Painter.'

Stopped by his parents from pursuing Journalism or a Commercial Art career, he left school at age 15, held a series of jobs during the next six years, and in 1965 joined the Royal Australian Navy. Married in 1969, he left the navy in early 1970. His first marriage ended in 1975. In 1980, he married his second wife, Penny. In 1984, he and Penny and their three daughters moved to Bundaberg, Queensland. He undertook university studies at Mitchell College of Advanced Education, gaining an Associate Diploma, majoring in Theatre Arts and Journalism, then a degree in Communications after moving to Queensland in 1984; followed by a Graduate Diploma in Public Relations, and a Masters in Professional Writing. In 2008, after his daughters had left home, he and Penny sold the family home and moved to a retirement village in Caboolture, Queensland, where he cared for his wife until her death in March 2011 from pancreatic cancer. In 2008, he switched from writing short stories in the horror genre, several of which have been published locally, to writing novels. To date, Adrian has written over sixty horror novels, and is even now working on the next one. At 65 plus years of age, he sees no end to his career, putting in up to eight hours a day on his novels. He describes himself as 'addicted to writing'.

He was brought up by a pack of wolves… The previous is just a horrid lie. Matt was born in Tonopah NV. He graduated high school in 2001 from Prescott AZ, where he also joined the Army. In truth, Matt graduated and joined the Army all within the same week. After basic training he went to South Korea for his first duty station. There, Matt Harvey was able to get involved and learn about the Korean culture. A part from his military training he taught conversational English, more or less just talked instead of taught, to students at a Korean high school. Matt was able to visit orphanages and spend time with the children there. And then he came home to go to college. Matt Harvey volunteered to go to Iraq 9 months later. He went over and made it back without a scratch. He still has some battles in his head to fight. For two years after Iraq, he went to Fort Knox to help train troops for Iraq. Over his 9 plus years in the Army he has received about ten or eleven Army Achievement Awards and maybe five Army Commendation Medals. He received them for all the standard reasons: tying his own boots, recognizing his right from his left 2 out of 3 times, being able to fire a water pistol without harming himself or others, etc. The Commendations Matt Harvey has received were for much more complex tasks, like chewing gum and walking at the same time. Currently, he is a student at Western International University. At Yavapai Community College he served on the Student Leadership Council and was a member of Phi Theta Kappa. He is trying to get a simple degree, anything that doesn’t involve too much work! In the end, he says, “I am happy with the path life has laid out for me”.", "related": ["B00HNZGJ1O"], "rank": 3912013, "title": "To Make a Long Story Longer", "author": "Matthew Harvey", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Citing a range of epidemiological studies conducted globally over the last 20 years, the authors show how genetics and environment work in tandem to create mental disorders. Women, who are much more likely than men to struggle with depression and anxiety, face unique environmental challenges: they are more likely to suffer triggering events like sexual abuse and domestic violence, and many wage lifelong battles against the strictures of traditional gender roles. Men, on the other hand, are more prone to substance-abuse problems, a trend the authors also chalk up to a combination of genetic and situational factors. The Freemans also discuss some less common problems, including eating disorders (which skew mostly female) and autism (an overwhelmingly male condition). The authors acknowledge that there are many flaws in the available research, and they recommend long-term studies that would follow participants over the course of their lives in order to link... social influences to an individual's life history, genetic make-up, biology, and psychological processes. Freeman's book is well-reasoned, thoroughly researched, and worthy of attention.

Drawing room dramas with romantic conflicts that though\nentertaining were not dark. I wanted to write a DARK Regency.With\ntouches of humor here and there.I wracked my brain\nfor several days trying to figure out what kind of story line I could do\n that would satisfy my suspenseful craving. And decided I needed a\nserial killer.I had just read several books on Jack the Ripper.\nOne of the best I've read to date is titled THE COMPLETE JACK THE RIPPER\n CASEBOOK BY DONALD RUMBLELOW\n Rumblelow is a retired Scotland Yard Detective and I was fascinated by\nhis book.

This book is a romance with a dark story line to it that will make you laugh and feel so good inside, then have you gutted and ugly crying and then moments later having your mind completely blown when you least expect it.

As a new writer, I am experimenting with different genres based on my reading habits. In my teens I was very keen on Science Fiction, reading many different authors Silverberg, Heinlein, Asimov, Niven and Clarke amongst many others. Their works tended to concern space within science fiction, this is what a news diet of the space race does for the imagination, rather than my later preference for a different type of Sci-Fi, such as Neal Stephenson's books Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.In the 1970's the BBC, in the UK, broadcast a series called The Survivors; I was gripped by it. The programme was remade and broadcast from 2006 to 2010 but this time I was not gripped, just frustrated by the portrayal and the reality factor. Both series portrayed life in the UK after a major virus that kills 95% of the population.Firstly a disclaimer, as I point out in my disclaimer notice in the book:'I have no personal experience of the end of the world as we know it, but neither do you...'Fiction is just that, it is not real, but if, like me, you like doses of reality mixed in then this is the type of plot that I have tried to write. The book is split into four parts. The first deals with the virus and the government's actions, the next three parts deal with the survivors. What do they have to do to survive, but it also covers their thoughts on why they survive. One of the issues I attempt to depict, is how the infected react to their impending doom, heroism, fanaticism or stoic acceptance. In the book, are several quotes on the fall of civilisation. I found these or had read them previously. I am interested in post-Roman Britain as an example of the fall of civilisation. How did so much technology and capability disappear?Roman houses had central heating, but nearly two thousand years later many houses in the UK still do not, or were built without it. In all the sections, I wanted to cover the realities of living in this new world. That has meant talking about sewage and latrines. I am not that interested in toilets, but it's something that I felt was missing from virtually every other book and film in the genre. My previous experience in the military helped here, not with the descriptions but the reality of survival. I found on deployments that living without a modern toilet or shower is not fun. Yes, camping for a few days with a chemical toilet might be an adventure, but we all feel relieved when we return home to hot running water and flushing loos. Modern humanity creates massive amounts of waste for disposal from food packaging to empty bottles. Even a scavenging society had to dispose of its waste. The sewers and drains no longer work so how do people cope. This element seems to be conveniently overlooked in nearly every film, TV, or book portrayal. The blockbuster movies love using CGI to destroy a city, when creeping grass over a road is more realistic and will eventually prevent road travel.Character development is always tricky, I prefer not to give too vivid physical descriptions of people, not because I am not picturing them in my mind, but I want the reader to paint their own picture. Where it is relevant I have described race and age, along with the gender, but I deliberately kept this minimal. I have also tried to write only from what the chief protagonist knows, might know or has been told by another character. Consequently, he does not know everything or why certain things in the plot have happened. I have given him some character traits, which go some way to providing an insight to his actions, but again I leave some of this open to interpretation. Mostly I wanted to write about what people did, more than the overreaching to survive.Many friends and family have asked if I have used them as the basis for my characters. This has a yes and no answer, in that some elements are bound to filter through, but it is more likely to be a snippet rather than an entire character. When I picture a character in my mind, I may base this on someone I have met, but it is unlikely to be a friend or family member, because that will condition my thoughts rather too much. Some survivors are more ruthless than others, which lead to other concerns about censorship and how far descriptions go. It remains a cause of concern and the more extreme I am, the less audience I might have in for example Young Adult readers, my books are not for children, but I read so called adult literature as a teenager, so the YA market is confusing for me anyway.Would I want my children to read what I have written? They are both adults, so it does not apply now; in fact most of the moral comments have come from friends who seem surprised that I can write about sex and violence. Morality, in my view, is easy when you are living in semi-luxury, with a full belly and enough water to drink. History teaches us that rape and other violence is common in stressful situations from war to famine. Disaster survivors, whether genocide or natural calamities, report different experiences, from Death Camp guards, to Schindler's List and onwards to cannibalism in the case of the Andes air crash survivors. If personal behaviour is based on background and culture what happens when that envelope disappears. I am not a woman, but if I were, would I sell my body for food, shelter, or water? As a man would I take advantage of such a woman and is that rape? In our comfortable homes we all like to think we would behave with decency and morality, but would we? Society no longer exists so its morals, may not survive either, in my story new moralities and behaviours takeover especially in the relationships between the survivors and the need to procreate.In the end I have written a fictional story. I hope thousands read it and enjoy it, but some will not, some will loathe it, some will criticise it, some will complain that it would have worked better with aliens, or zombies, or a nuclear war.

She majored in English Literature at Carleton College. After graduation, she taught high school English, then served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in South America. Later she earned a masters degree in Secondary Education (with a concentration in TESOL) at the University of New Mexico. She has lived in many places, including: Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, Brazil, Tennessee, New Mexico, Virginia, the Netherlands, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Married to her Carleton classmate, David, she has three grown children and six grandsons.She is the author ofThe Riddle of Penncroft Farm, an award-winning novel about the American Revolution for young readers. Named a Teachers Choice Selection by the International Reading Association soon after publication, it is read in classrooms throughout the U.S.Dorothea hugely enjoys writing and reading aloud stories in verse. She tells her grandsons (who \"star\" in some of the stories) that she has eight elves in her head telling her what to write down. This is not far from the truth. Three of the stories dictated by the elves have been finished; five more are in the works, for the rest of the Izzy Elves: Frizzy, Fizzy, Quizzy, Bizzy, and Whizzy.Dorothea is also working on another historical novel for young readers. It is set in 1825 in the small town in New Hampshire where she has lived since 1991.In addition to writing, Dorothea is an experienced actress and singer. She performed with the Ex Machina Baroque Opera Company in Minneapolis, and also played most of the Gilbert and Sullivan battle-ax contralto and ingenue mezzo roles with companies in Philadelphia and Minneapolis. The last time she played a ditzy G & S teenager was when she was 44, which required a wig, contact lenses, false eyelashes, and plenty of make up!She narrated her first three Izzy Elves stories for audiobooks, available at Amazon.com, Audible.com, and iTunes.", "related": ["B00EO3HPIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loves challenging herself and would write on a dare. On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B00EOFZ97G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, she had no idea that one day she would star in her own fairy tale. Although she had seen fairies as a child, she never imagined that she would channel a book from their realm until decades later, after she had further developed her psychic skills. One day she felt the fairies beckoning her from the other side of the veil of perception, encouraging her to write a book with them. She decided to see what would happen if she followed her instinct, so she used her skill of clairaudience (psychic hearing)to perform a written question-and-answer session with them. The first session led to more questions and more answers, and eventually the book Fairy Wisdom for Spiritual Evolution. Before becoming an author, Sarah Jane pursued her love of words in a newsroom. She graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in journalism with an emphasis in reporting and editing. Afterward, she accepted an internship that took her to California s Central Valley. The internship, at a midsize newspaper s copy desk, turned into a job where she sifted through punctuation, grammar and headlines for more than a dozen years. Now Sarah Jane runs a business using her psychic skills to help other people connect with archangels and their spirit guides, many of whom are fairies, but also guardian angels and other benevolent beings. Sarah Jane s primary skill of extrasensory perception is clairaudience, but she also frequently uses clairsentience (psychic feeling), claircognizance (psychic knowing) and clairvoyance (psychic seeing) to help her clients. Sarah Jane s desire to help others also inspired her to become a certified massage therapist and to study energy healing. For fun, Sarah Jane escapes to nature, exploring beaches, mountains and forests. She also loves cuddling her cats, watching bad TV, eating good food, dancing to music with funky beats and napping.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Prophetess Lindsey has spent twenty years studying the word of God and served eleven consecutive before entering full time ministry. She has traveled extensively imparting the Kingdom mandate of preparation for the Glory of the Manifested Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. Delisa has a unique gift for imparting prophetic understanding of times and seasons with a keen prophetic eye with powerful signs and wonders following. The Lord called her, The Big Eyed Prophet, indicating her spiritual ability to see into the spiritual realm and discern evil forces at work. Prophetess Lindsey has a strong global ministry where she impacts thousands of lives almost daily as she releases fresh words of wisdom, revelation, warning, and instruction to the Body of Christ at large. Although Prophetess Lindsey was commissioned as an Apostle, her love for the prophetic outweighed a claim for a new title.

She is the Senior Instructor at True Love Apostolic College, a prolific writer of bible studies, commentaries, prophetic articles, a prophetic song writer and a devoted mother to six children whom she and her husband have raised to be active in ministry.

She is a graduate of Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia. Currently, she is collaborating on a new book with her cat, Doolittle.
