In true Manhattan tradition, the other pedestrians, dressed mostly in business suits, swirled around her, crossing against the light and prompting some angry horn-honking in spite of the police cruiser that swung onto Fifty-seventh Street.Five years now she'd lived in the city, and it hadn't changed one tiny bit. She had. No choice there. Survival of the fittest. She straightened. Hmm. Not a bad name for her new fitness club. Go figure. She'd spent weeks trying to come up with a name before she applied for a license, and there it was. Not that she had all of the start-up money yet. But she was almost there. Six months and she'd be ordering equipment and signing the lease.The walk signal flashed and she jogged across the street to the mailbox in front of the St. Martine Hotel, where she had a client this morning, and deposited her bimonthly letter to her parents. E-mail would be so much easier, but they didn't own a computer and she doubted they ever would. Third-generation farmers, who'd only recently splurged on a satellite dish for their ten-year-old television, neither of her parents had ridden on an airplane or seen the ocean. In fact, they hadn't stepped foot out of Indiana.Lucky for her, since she didn't have to worry about any surprise visits from them. Not that she didn't love them both to pieces, but they thought she was someone she wasn't and she didn't have the heart to set them straight.\"Morning, Dana.\" St. Martine's veteran doorman with his watery blue eyes and pleasant round face held open the lobby door for her.\"Thanks, George. Looks like it's gonna be another scorcher,\" she said, pulling her ponytail tighter so that the hair stayed off the back of her neck. Her hair was too long and totally impractical, especially for running every day. If she had an ounce of sense she'd whack it all off. But vanity won out every time she tried to talk herself into it, which really ticked her off.She wasn't Borden County's reigning Miss Teen Dairy anymore, nor had she participated in a beauty pageant for the past six years. Or ever would again. But the long blond mane had earned her at least one commercial hawking shampoo, and even then, she'd shared the spotlight with a brunette and a redhead. A far cry from taking Broadway by storm.\"You think it's hot out here,\" George whispered, and nodded his head toward the lobby. \"Heard there was another one last night.\"\"Oh, no. What did they get?\"\"No one's saying. We've all been warned to keep mum. Junior's threatening to write up any employee caught discussing the theft.\" George's ruddy face lit with a grin. \"You didn't hear a peep from me,\" he said, winking and stepping back to let her into the lobby.\"Not a word,\" Dana agreed, smiling.Everyone knew George referred to the new assistant manager as Junior. A recent Cornell graduate, Kyle Williams would rid the hotel of any employee over forty if he had his way, but the unions were too strong and George wasn't about to give up his six-figure job opening doors for the hotel's wealthy guests.Heck, Dana wouldn't mind getting in on that kind of action herself, but there were literally waiting lists for those types of jobs all over the city. Although, as it was, she did like her job. She was her own boss and got paid to exercise, which she did every day anyway. Amazing what an out-of-towner was willing to pay to be escorted on a run through Central Park or along the Hudson River.The lobby was more subdued than usual. One of the housekeeping staff, who had to be new because Dana didn't recognize her, dusted around the large vase of fresh-cut flowers sitting on the Asian-inspired table that served as the lobby's centerpiece. A couple in business suits stood talking near the elevators and another guest leaning on the black-lacquered front desk appeared to be checking in, or, given the early hour, perhaps checking out.Dana's friend Amy was one of the clerks working behind the desk, but she wasn't the one helping the man and, after meeting Dana's eyes, she walked purposely to the far end of the counter. Dana got the message and met her near the concierge's unmanned smoky-glass cubicle. Odd. Kelly was always there. The three of them usually grabbed a ten-minute cup of coffee before Dana met up with her first client.\"Where is she?\" she asked, getting a bad vibe from the way Amy's anxious gaze scanned the lobby.\"Security.\" Amy's voice was low. \"We had another theft last night. Fourth one this month.\"\"So why are they talking to Kelly?\"\"They're talking to everybody. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked to see you.\"\"Me?\"Amy nodded, her large dark eyes coming back to Dana. \"Nothing personal. It's just that you've practically been a fixture here the past couple of months.\"\"Thanks to all the business you guys throw me.\" She glanced over her shoulder, unnerved that she'd be of any interest to security. \"I still don't understand why they'd want to talk to me though.\"\"You were on the property yesterday. That makes you a candidate for questioning.\" Amy gave her a wicked smile. \"But then again, Kyle probably would protect you.\"Dana rolled her eyes. The assistant manager had been a pain in the ass from the first day she'd met him. He'd asked her out three times in three weeks. She'd been polite in her first two refusals, not so subtle the last time. If he tried one more time, she wouldn't be responsible for her actions.\"Hey, guys.\" Kelly joined them, already slipping off her navy blue blazer as she rounded her desk. \"I'm afraid I won't have time for coffee.\"\"How was it?\" Amy asked. \"You weren't gone long.\"\"Pretty straightforward.\" Kelly pushed long slender fingers through her strawberry-blond hair and then lowered herself onto her chair, her gaze going to her calendar.Like Dana and Amy and countless others, she'd come to New York from a small midwestern town hoping to make it big. Like them, she'd failed miserably, although landing the assistant concierge job had been quite a coup. Good money. A certain amount of prestige. And it beat waiting tables like some of the less-fortunate hopefuls they'd met in the early days at casting calls and standing in line at the unemployment office.Amy glanced over her shoulder and then leaned closer. \"What kind of questions did they ask?\"\"They just want to confirm shift times, if and when you left your station, that sort of thing.\"Dana checked her watch. Five minutes until her appointment with Chase Culver. After that she had to hurry across town to meet her regular Tuesday-morning client. She wouldn't have time to talk to anyone today. Not that she had anything to say. \"What was taken?\"Behind her someone noisily cleared their throat. Without looking she knew who it was by the way dread crawled over her skin.\"Talking about the theft, are we, ladies?\"She turned to Kyle with wide-eyed innocence, and in a loud voice said, \"There was another theft? Here? When?\"He gave her a wry look before adjusting his left cuff link and sliding an exasperated look toward the front desk. The guest checking out turned toward them with interest.Good thing Dana couldn't see Kelly and Amy's faces—it would've been hard to keep a straight one herself. Singing had once been her claim to fame, not acting. Although she'd taken enough classes when she'd first arrived in the city.\"I'd appreciate you keeping your voice down, Dana,\" Kyle said in that proper-Bostonian tone that was as phony as his knockoff Rolex. \"We don't need our guests alarmed.\"She smiled. \"No, that wouldn't be good for business.\" She backed away, throwing a look at Kelly and Amy. \"See you guys later.\"\"I didn't mean to chase you off,\" Kyle said with that creepy smile of his, while putting his hand on her arm.She did all she could not to jerk away. Instead she kept backing up until contact was naturally broken. \"I have to meet a client.\"He let his smarmy gaze wander down the front of her tank top, down her Spandex running shorts to her bare legs. \"Of course.\"She couldn't stand to look at him another second and abruptly turned toward the house phone by the elevator. The doors opened and a tall, wiry man in his early thirties walked out. He had dark longish hair, piercing blue eyes, and he wore shorts and a T-shirt hugging really broad shoulders. Holy cow, it wasn't Christmas and she hadn't been particularly good all year, but please, please be Chase Culver.Chase knew it was her. Not because he'd done his homework on her last night. Nothing on a piece of paper could prepare him for Dana McGuire in the flesh. Tall, slim and blond, her sapphire-blue eyes were enough to take the wind out of him. Centerfold material. This was the kind of woman men made fools of themselves over. Lost marriages and fortunes and reputations. Good to remember that.\"Dana?\"She smiled. \"How did you know?\"\"We're the only two people underdressed.\"\"Oh, right.\" She gave a small sheepish shrug as she glanced down at her shorts.He jumped on the opportunity to take another look himself. Long perfect legs that stopped just this side of heaven. Keeping his mind on business wasn't going to be easy. In fact, he needed to revamp his bio quickly. The phony businessman-from-Houston spiel he'd prepared was okay, but to get the most bang for his buck, he had to bump it up. Become the kind of man she needed most. Because basically there were two reasons why a woman who looked like her came to New York, and he'd bet his '67 Mustang convertible he knew what had lured her to the bright lights.\"Have you already done some stretching?\" she asked, leading him toward the lobby doors.They passed near the front desk where two women in hotel uniforms openly stared. The guy in the suit was one of those prissy twerps that grated on Chase. \"Some.\"\"Do you jog regularly?\" Her gaze briefly caught on his ringless left hand, and then ran down his body.His gut ti...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a polemic--in the best sense of the word--about the failures of political leaders in France, on the left as much as the right, to address the underlying weakesses of the national system of welfare and work or to redress the continuing inequities in French society.\"    Vivien Schmidt, Boston University\"This is a remarkable and wonderful book. It should be read by those interested in all aspects of French culture and in the welfare state across the globe. ...a hard-hitting, yet balanced and well-researched book that is bound to be both controversial and convincing.\"    Peter Baldwin, UCLA\"Here is the book on contemporary France.  Why is the French quality of life so high?  But at the same time why has France gone so badly wrong?  How has the French welfare state evolved into an instrument of privilege and exclusion? No observer of Europe, France, or international economics can do without this vitally important book.\"     Tyler Cowen, Professor of Economics, George Mason University and Director of the Mercatus Center and the James Buchanan Center for Political Economy\"Timothy Smith's fast-moving and tightly-reasoned France in Crisis cuts through the smokescreen of misinformation which veils the French social model. He exposes the pretentions of intellectuals, the inequities created by dysfunctional institutions, the gaps between promise and performance. Smith's message to the French is clear: we have met the enemy, and he is us.\"    John Gillingham III, Univ. of Missouri, St. Louis\"Globalization is the source of France's current economic problems, right? Think again. Tim Smith argues that the failures of the French welfare state are the result of its own wrongdoings, which French politicians have persistently failed to address. Yet in spite of its forceful critique of contemporary French economy and society, France in Crisis offers a hopeful argument that, even in an age of globalization, governments still possess a certain margin of maneuver to conduct autonomous policies and tame the worst effects of the market while achieving full employment.\"    Sophie Meunier, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies\"France in Crisis features extensive notes, an appendix listing significant French social legislation, easy to follow in text definitions of terms such as 'social market economy' and 'corporatism' and a concise, bulleted list of possible solutions in the final chapter.  Smith acknowledges the successes of France's welfare state, particularly some aspects of the health care system, but he does not shy away from constructively criticizing the shortcomings of a nation umbilically attached to a gargantuan State.  This volume is not simply a rant against French social policy, but a sort of how-to manual for creating economic and social solidarity.\" - Christy Wampole, Stanford University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He knew, of course, that the feeling wouldn't last. Even at the young age of twenty-six, he was already keenly aware that disappointment was the shadow forever lurking round the corner, but just right now…He had a feeling of perfect satisfaction as he briefly considered where he was. Metaphorically. The golden and only child of a couple whose name in Italy was a byword for wealth. From the moment of his birth—and probably, he thought with wry amusement, from the instant of conception—he had been lavished with everything vast sums of money could offer. He had been a child doted upon by his parents and reared to inherit the mantle of his father's massive business concerns. It was a legacy which had sat easily on his shoulders. He was bright, and to the deep and lasting approval of his father had refused to accept his birthright without earning it.He had spent the past eight years adding credentials to his title, first from Oxford University, then Harvard, and then had come his working stint in London which had been fulfilling and hugely successful.He had felt his first real taste of power, had noted and rather enjoyed the reluctantly won admiration from men far older than him. He had witnessed the sharpening of knives behind backs, had tasted the heady rush that comes with the making of money, and had thrilled to it.And now here he was, poised and ready for the invigorating and cut-throat career that lay ahead of him. This little break in the Tuscan hills, as he dipped his toes into the one area of his family businesses which he had so far ignored, was proving to be as educational as it was enjoyable.He had always been happy to drink the wine but it was interesting to get a taste for its production.Nothing too involved, of course. His area of expertise would always be primarily in the financial arena. Still, he never suspected that the brief interruption to his pre-destined and rapid upward climb would prove as fruitful as it now was.His eyes slid to the woman lying next to him, who was basking in the night-time warmth where the air was alive with the sounds of tiny creatures, and the sultry stirring of the trees and undergrowth in the gentle breeze.It was too dark to make out her features, but he didn't have to. He had spent the past seven weeks almost exclusively in her company and her face and body were imprinted in his head. He would have been able to trace every small contour of her fabulous body with his eyes shut.Oh yes. Life felt very good indeed.As if on cue, Charlie turned onto her side and propped herself up on one elbow. She couldn't help herself. She reached out and splayed her fingers through his hair. Dark, dark hair that was worn longer than the boys she knew in England, with their silly, prissy haircuts and their infantile behaviour.'I wish you weren't going tomorrow,' she repeated for the millionth time. 'I know you probably think that I'm being clingy, but it's just going to be solonelyhere without you.'Riccardo caught her hand and planted a kiss on the soft underside of her wrist. It made her squirm. It always did. Every time he touched her. They had just made love. Right here. With the night around them and only a blanket separating them from the prickly grass. Still she could feel her nipples hardening and every muscle in her body tensing in exquisite anticipation.'You are insatiable,' Riccardo said huskily. He dropped his hand to her waist, running it up and under her tee-shirt, and felt the now familiar perfection of her rounded breast. He massaged it slowly, rubbing the hard nipple with his thumb.She whimpered with gratifying eagerness, and with a smile of pleasure he pushed up the tee-shirt. The faint light from the moon showed her breasts in all their glory. True, she might be slightly built with almost no hips to speak of, but she had the breasts of a real woman. Full and rounded with big, pink nipples that were designed to be licked and teased.As he proceeded to do now.Charlie moaned and curled her fingers into his hair.'No,' she gasped, not wanting the conversation to slip past, because she was so desperate to find out whether he would miss her as much as she knew she was going to misshim.Riccardo ignored the protest. Actually, he was only vaguely aware that she had spoken at all. The rush of blood to his head and the fierce stirrings of his body cocooned him in a glorious bubble of pure sensation. The feel of her nipple against his tongue… the touch of her thighs as he impatiently shoved up her thin cotton skirt and pulled down her underwear…the dampness between her legs then as they obligingly parted for his questing hand… the throbbing nub of her clitoris as he roused it with his fingers. He continued to bombard her breasts with his mouth, sucking hard on first one nipple, then the next, while his own body surged to heights he couldn't remember attaining.'Riccardo… stop…' she pleaded, making no effort to pull away from him. In fact, just the opposite. 'If you don't, I won't be able to stop myself…' She tugged his hand, and before he could return to his devastating caresses Charlie pushed him onto his back. Her near-climax was sending waves of sensation racing through her body, making her movements frantic as she did away with the clothes separating their feverish bodies. Then she slid onto him and flung her head back, eyes shut, her breasts bouncing as she controlled the rhythm of their lovemaking, until he shuddered under her just as she reached her body's nirvana.She sagged forward, spent, and enjoyed the gentle touch of his hands on her breasts as he came down with her from his own personal peak of satisfaction.'Have I told you that you have beautiful breasts?'Riccardo asked, and Charlie subsided onto him with a smile.'I believe you have. But please don't let that get in the way of repeating yourself.' She grinned and nuzzled him on his chin, loving the way the faint abrasive feel of his bristle felt against her smooth skin. She didn't think that any of the boys in her circle of university friends hadbristle.Ever since she had become involved with Riccardo, she had blithely lumped all her male acquaintances into some indistinct category with the heading 'young and therefore immature'.Of course, they would be, she thought guiltily. They were, after all, only eighteen. The same age as her. Not that Riccardo was aware of that little fact. She quickly shoved the thought to the back of her head and concentrated on the matter in hand—namely trying to find out howhe feltabout her. And not just the lust bit.She clasped her fingers together under her chin and surveyed him seriously.'Will you miss me?' she asked.With her breasts squashed against his chest, and in the languorous aftermath of unbridled passion, Riccardo didn't find it too hard to tell her that he would.'Not that I would call three days a lifetime,' he teased, brushing back her hair.'I know it's not alifetime,but it's alongtime. I mean, we've been in each other's company forweeks.It's just going to be a little… odd, working here at the vineyard and not seeing you around and about.'Inmyvineyard, Riccardo thought proudly, although she wasn't aware of that. As far as she was concerned, he was just bumming around, doing a bit of this and a bit of that on the production side. Since he had never in his life done any bumming around, he was quite charmed to be thought of in that light.More realistically, there was no way he was going to give her any inkling as to what he was really all about. Gold-diggers swarmed around wealthy men like flies to a honey pot, and it was refreshing to spend his time with a woman without crazy suspicions proliferating in his head.'It'll give you time to catch up with those friends of yours.''I guess itisonly a few days,' Charlie sighed. She slid off him. 'There, you can breathe now that I'm off you.' She reached for her tee-shirt and he stopped her.'Not yet. I like looking at you naked.''Just a shame most of it has to take place outdoors,' she said wistfully. 'Honestly, the amount of times I've tried to hint to Jayne and Simone that they should go spend a night somewhere so that we could have the place to ourselves…''A night where?''Oh, I don't know.' She giggled. 'Wherever it is people go to when they want to give other people space in a cramped flat.''Ah,thatmystery place. I suppose if they knew of its existence they might have been more obliging.' He linked his hands behind his head, comfortable in his own nudity, and appreciated the lines of her body. The sun had turned her skin a healthy golden colour, which suited her long, streaky blonde hair and wide blue eyes. He thought, not for the first time, how much younger she looked than her twenty-four years, but then that was probably because she wore next to no make-up, which was always ageing on a woman.'And also,' Charlie ventured tentatively, 'I'm not going to be around for much longer. I have to get back to England.''Yes. And that will be exciting for you. Taking up a new job, meeting new people.''Um, yes,' she said indistinctly, thinking of the university life looming in front of her. Two months ago, she couldn't wait to get there. Now she was dreading it after her heady summer in the sun. And then you'll be off as well… Do you realise you've never actually told me exactly where your next port of call is going to be?' Although, she now thought, she had told him practically everything about herself. About her dad dying when she was six, and being brought up by her mother who had worked her fingers to the bone so that her two daughters didn't have to do without. About her mother being the victim of a hit-and-run accident which had put Charlie off cars for a long time. About her sister now living in Australia, happily married and with a brand-new baby whom Charlie had never seen except on her computer.Okay, so she had ...", "related": ["B00186Z0XW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.4286, "rating_total": 24.0}

The author contends that colonialism and anti-Asian bias made for common cause between African-Americans and Indians, and explores how Indian thought significantly influenced African-American culture—from the expected examination of Martin Luther King Jr.'s adoption of Gandhi's techniques of nonviolent resistance to more surprising revelations on the South Asian influence on abolitionists and the Nation of Islam, and the close friendship between Paul Robeson and Jawaharlal Nehru. In arguing that the momentum toward independence in India and equality for U. S. Negroes... became intertwined, Horne presents a variety of examples of cultural cross-pollination—African-Americans reading Gandhi and writing on colonialism while Indians were writing on the race problem in the United States, and more. Readers interested in African-American history, race relations and anticolonialist movements will find Horne's book overstuffed and somewhat rambling, but still an informative and useful exploration of fresh territory.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After her work on the Obama campaign, 35-year-old Ida Dunbar expects a placement in the new administration, but it appears her hopes are dashed as a result of statements made by her outspoken father, civil rights legend Rev. Horace Dunbar. After his latest ill-considered remark, longtime family friend Miss Iona calls Ida and asks that she return home to Georgia to check on her father. Meanwhile, Wes Harper, the son of the Rev's closest confidante, returns, but for a different purpose: a Republican operative, he's been tasked with securing the Rev's voter database in order to purge the voting rolls. The author paints those associated with Ida and her father with a broad, loving, brush, while Wes and the Republicans are predictably and cartoonishly villainous. With the exception of remembrances of pivotal moments in the civil rights movement, the book is a tedious polemic, even for those inclined to agree with the narrative's political bent.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While nearly one out of three of the gay businesspeople they surveyed had experienced on-the-job discrimination, most of those who revealed their sexual orientation in the workplace reported minimal or no repercussions and felt they had achieved the same promotions and income levels as heterosexuals. Virtually all of the openly gay interviewees said their openness resulted in greater closeness to co-workers and bosses. By contrast, closeted respondents who were suspected of being gay at work suffered the greatest discrimination. Combining interviews and analysis, this well-organized, optimistic report contains a wealth of practical information for gay and lesbian businesspeople?and their heterosexual associates?on overcoming stereotypes and intolerance, coming out at work, getting hired and promoted, mentoring and helping others. An extensive resource guide covers online information services, gay professional and networking organizations, employee groups, books, statutes and ratings of companies' policies on nondiscrimination and domestic-partner benefits.

BATman) invented the Billiard Aim Trainer™ (BAT) in 2004 while contemplating a method to teach his billiard students how to understand and apply the three-cut aiming system he learned as a boy while practicing snooker.  Paul started playing pool in 1973 at the age of 10, on a 7-foot particleboard pool table in his family’s garage. Fascinated by the art and geometry of billiards, Paul studied the books of legendary snooker and billiard greats Joe Davis, Walter Lindrum, and Eddie Charlton. Soon afterwards, he became a fan of a new BBC series called Pot Black, featuring the new breed of snooker professionals like Steve Davis and Jimmy White. With a sense of optimism, Paul began practicing on 12-foot snooker tables for four hours a day, meticulously going through drill after drill to perfect his game, in the hope of one day becoming a professional snooker player.  Then in 1983, as if called to a higher purpose, Paul put away his snooker cue and traveled east to study the ancient mystical teachings of India. It is that experience that Paul now draws on when explaining the more subtle aspects of billiards, like mind management and gamesmanship. In 1995, Paul founded Food for Life Global (www.FFL.org), the world’s largest vegan food relief organization, with projects in over fifty countries. He still directs the charity from his home in New York. Paul did not pick up a cue again until 2002, when friends encouraged him to try out nine ball. Drawing from his past snooker experience and his extensive study of the art, Paul quickly established a reputation among his peers, and soon many of them began asking for personal training.  In 2006, Paul founded the Billiards Training Company to manufacture and sell his invention, the Billiard Aim Trainer™, which is now being used by professional pool players, coaches, and thousands of amateur players all over the world.  Paul continues his study of the art and science of billiards, and has since been personally trained by world champions Allison Fisher and Gerda Hofstatter, as well as by top touring pro, Max Eberle, and Master BCA instructor, Jerry Briesath.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He founded his first “enterprise” around the age of 10 years old: it was a car washing business. His younger sister Catherine and friend Julia were the hired help. Tony was the salesman. Despite the business having only one client and lasting only a single day, he never forgot how easy it was to make money solving people’s problems. Since then Tony has learned the ropes of business and finance from his studies and experience. Over the past 16 years he has travelled Australia and Asia teaching business and finance principles to thousands. In 2005 he helped build the fastest growing accounting firm in Australia, as Managing Director, taking the company from $2.5 million turnover to over $10 million in just over 2 years. Without spending any money on marketing! During that same period he co-authored three best-selling finance books. In 2008, working only part-time, he grew his publication business from $300,000 per year to over $2 million in just 12 months and his latest best-selling book, From Red to Black has established a whole new scene for financial control. In recent years, Tony has extended his expertise to help other business owners via his unique Mentoring Program with participants ranging from a host of industries such as Winery, Property Inspection Business, Accounting, Marketing and trade industries including Engineering, Glazing, Air Conditioning and Home Maintenance, to mention but a few. Tony’s achievements have seen him featured in the media, with numerous articles and interviews on radio and TV including The Morning Show, Sunrise, Sky News and 9am with David & Kym. While Tony is a successful businessman and investor he considers himself first and foremost an educator. Today, Tony is focusing his energy on educating people about the subject of money: how it works, how to make and how to control it. By combating the lack of financial training in our educational system, Tony believes that everyone can truly prosper with the right information and the right money habits.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This unabridged audio production of The Third Round is superbly narrated by Roy McMillan; making it a highly recommended addition to personal and community library audiobook collections! - --Wisconsin BookwatchBy the time Sapper pen name for Herman Cyril McNeile published the third of hisBulldog Drummondnovels in 1924, an action-adventure franchise was already firmly under way. As described in his debut story in 1920, Capt. Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond, D.S.O., M.C., is a World War I vet hungering to enjoy the lusty sporting life of a wealthy English gentleman. In short order, Drummond and his equally adventuresome band are taking on extraordinary criminals and conspiracies. The character was so popular that the first book was quickly and successfully adapted for the stage while its author became the highest paid short story writer of the 1920s. Bulldog first came to the silent movie screen in 1923, and various incarnations and series were produced until the late 1960s. Alfred Hitchcock's 1934The Man Who Knew Too Muchwas based on Bulldog Drummond stories. Richard Johnson gave Bulldog a very Bondian take inDeadlier Then the Male(1966) andSome Girls Do(1968). Along the way, Bulldog starred in his own radio show and was the lead avenger in books written by various authors well after Sapper died in 1937. In theCase of The Third Round(book, 1924; film, 1925), Drummond isn't the only recurring character. The arch-nemesis of the first four novels is master of disguise Carl Peterson, who repeatedly tries to pull the puppet strings of criminal escapades that typically threaten the fate of England. Clearly based on literary predecessors such as Moriarty and Fu Manchu, this time Peterson is after a formula created by Professor Goodman that can make flawless diamonds. Members of the Metropolitan Diamond Syndicate, fearful of this threat to their profits, hire Peterson to silence Goodman only to have their assassin turn out to have plans of his own. And these plans include silencing his old foe, Bulldog Drummond, in a watery grave, after getting in some psychotic revenge. As with all such romps, the story is a series of contrived and fast-paced twists and turns designed to surprise and tantalise readers. Perhaps the biggest surprise is how little many of these books have become dated. Perhaps that's because the formula created by the \"Clubland' writers like John Buchan, Dornford Yates and Sapper, would shape so much of the James Bond oeuvre to the point that many of the elements of Drummond stories are still essential in contemporary adventure tales, as in the books of Clive Cussler and Jack Higgins. Only the technology and geopolitical backdrops have significantly changed. Well, no gentleman of Drummond's breeding would engage in extramarital sex. Few contemporary heroes and their villains can banter with equal repartee. Hence, these books were once ideal for British schoolboys. The most astute of them must have picked up what was more than obvious then and now: no one should take a single page of these tales seriously. For this new Naxos AudioBooks edition, narrator Roy McMillan continues the leisurely, tongue-in-cheek style he gave to his readings of the first two Sapper books,Bulldog Drummond(1920) andThe Black Gang(1922). These are the sort of novels perfect for terminal or on-the-road listening as they're light fare, simple and fun. Most readers will be amazed that a character and his milieu, now almost a century old, are as entertaining now as they were when Ian Fleming was a teenager. --Wesley Britton, Blogcritics", "related": ["B0040JI3JM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is best known for his 1894 book, The Spirit-Filled Life. MacNeil was born into a Presbyterian family in Scotland, but was brought up in Ballarat, Victoria. He studied theology at New College, Edinburgh and was ordained in 1879. Shortly afterwards he was introduced to the Higher Life movement. He experienced \"an anointing of the Holy Spirit\" and in 1881 began evangelistic ministry. Poor health, however, hindered his itinerant work until he recovered after laying on of hands by an Anglican minister. He then toured Australia, seeing many people turn to Jesus. In 1890, together with a few others, he formed a prayer group which came to be known as \"The Band\". They met regularly to pray for revival. They also focused strongly on the need for an infilling of the Holy Spirit, and prayed for \"the full Baptism of the Holy Spirit for themselves and for all ministers, officers and members of the Churches.\" From their prayer times came a decision to hold a Keswick-style convention in Geelong, with George Grubb, who had addressed Keswick Conventions in England, as the primary speaker, along with MacNeil, Webb and others. In 1896, MacNeil toured Queensland a final time. At the end of his tour, in late August, he collapsed and died in a city shop.", "related": ["B003HKRBS4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Spinella-Phillips Born in 1957, in Huntington, on Long Island, I've been driven by an insatiable love of writing, art, and the sciences since very early childhood. My love of animal tales fueled my desire to write, always manifesting in stories from the non-human point of view. I invented my very first character at six years old, creating picture books with a tree as the main protagonist. I included, on the inside covers, my very own publishing logo, complete with rainbow and shining sun! In my senior year of High School, one of my teachers, Mr. O'Connor, lent me a copy of The Fellowship of the Ring, which changed my reading and writing life forever, driving me into the unique and futuristic world of Fantasy/Science Fiction. In college, I majored in Art and Earth Sciences, where inspiration fired my vivid and eccentric imagination, planting the seeds for my Furlites of Aroriel novels, Over the years, I honed the complex world of this alien family saga. My husband's love and support over the decades proved invaluable, since his scientific knowledge and expertise quickly surpassed my own, once we graduated high school, went off to college, and entered the working world. With his help, and that of my mentor, David Ayscue, who passed away in 2010, I completed the first two of these books, On Matissia Wings, and, Earth-bred Matissia-born,which are now available. Other tales are in the works! I dabbled with another tale many years ago, using my Khan as a character, when my big Maine Coon became seriously ill. While battling Khan's insidious disease, I completed the story, which took on deeper impact far beyond my intended feline fantasy yarn. KHAN: A Maine Coon is the result, a biography of his life, with fictional elements, written from his point of view. Owned by three cats, two of which are Maine Coon cats, I live with my husband in the rolling hills of northwestern Connecticut.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was estranged with her mother, lived with her father, married, divorced and put herself through school.  It's time to take care of Caroline, so she found a job with the third rate Fil-Er-Fast, a gasoline company, then broke her leg.  She's in a cast and is a klutz on crutches so she's stuck in a wheelchair for the time being.  Natalie Perry, an heiress, is just a baby when her mother and father die, leaving her to her older sister, Caroline Grant.  Attorney Kent Mackay represents the late Perry's and it's his duty to see to the guardianship of little Natalie.  Kent and Natalie arrive from Dallas hoping Caroline will agree to become Natalie's legal guardian.  Kent ingratiates himself on Caroline and he uses his considerable charm to Natalie's advantage, and his own.  Caroline tries to resist the adorable baby and the handsome attorney because they don't fit in with her life's plan at the moment, but she grows fond of baby Natalie, and of Kent Mackay.  Kent and Natalie move in with Caroline temporarily and that gives the three of them a chance to bond, and it also helps to dissolve Caroline's attitude towards bringing up a baby.  When their relationship takes a serious turn it remains for Kent and a Judge to decide what the future will hold.  This enjoyable romance, What To Do About Baby, incorporates the worthwhile message that despite our lineage or environment, it's what we make of ourselves that counts.Martha Hix cleverly combines  romance with an important message in a very subtle, readable and enjoyable way! What To Do About Baby has good, strong characters and a unusual plot that make it more than just a romance! Fine writing by Martha Hix!Gloria Miller  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

The epilogue on his father's funeral alone more than justifies the whole book.\"--Elizabeth Fox-Genovese,Common Knowledge\"Interesting and thought-provoking.\"--Safro Kwame,Lincoln University\"Montaigne invented the modern essay;...Appiah has the brilliance to extend it.\"--The Village Voice\"A groundbreaking--as well as ground-clearing--analysis of absurdities and damaging presuppositions that have clouded our discussions of race, Africa and nationalism since the 19th century....Mr. Appiah delivers what may very well be one of the handful of theoretical works on race that will help preserve our humanity and guide us gracefully into the next century.\"--Charles Johnson,The New York Times Book Review\"Appiah's essays are exquisitely and painstakingly argued.\"--Washington Post Book World\"An exceptional work, whose contextual sweep and lucidity provide a refreshing intellectual tone away from yahoo populism. In many profound ways, Kwame Appiah'sIn My Father's Houseushers in a new level of discourse on race and culture, placing it within a universal narrative--and where else should it belong?...Without question, a first of its kind.\"--Wole Soyinka, fromRace and the Rout of Reason\"In My Father's Houseis a remarkable book that brings previously invisible cultural assumptions to the surface and obliges us to rethink our conceptions about African identity. Drawing upon a variety of elegantly analyzed historical examples and relating them to his own personal experiences of the African world, Anthony Appiah convincingly demonstrates the need to go beyond stereotyped notions of race and futile laments about past injustices. His observations about authenticity movements, the persistence of Western constructions of African realities, and the emergence of new syntheses of knowledge among African peoples represent a major breakthrough in the ongoing debate over the future of African culture.\"--Richard Bjornson,Ohio State University\"This is an absorbing and path-breaking book by a gifted philosopher.  Appiah rescues the philosophy of culture from Herder by insisting that we drop notions like 'authentic negritude' and that 'African culture' is the name of an important project rather than of an available datum.  The book's range of reference and the vigor of its argumentation are equally impressive.\"--Richard Rorty,University of Virginia\"Appiah's concern is, he modestly states, 'with the situation of African intellectuals.'  In the growing literature on the subject, nobody has defined that situation, as it exists now, more sharply; nobody has built so many bridges to a discourse that might be shared universally.  Learned yet unpretentious, serious and witty, critical and kind--this book is bound to infuse debates among African intellectuals with new vigor and to engage philosophers, literary critics, anthropologists and others everywhere.  One also wishes it would be read by politicians for its lucid analyses of racism as well as its demonstration of intellectual independence tempered by colonial and post-colonial experience.\"--Johannes Fabian,University of Amsterdam", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Referring to herself throughout in the second person, narrator Lauren immediately draws readers into her life as she explains that she and her best friend Tara are eating lunch in that part of the cafeteria she dubs \"the realm of the socially inferior,\" while the popular girls sit at the \"Don't-You-Wish-You-Were-Me table.\" Though she longs to be part of the in-crowd, Lauren lacks the confidence to even attempt to belong; she refuses to wear makeup, for example, because she fears that her classmates would \"snigger and say you were trying to be an A-list girl. It's safer not to try.\" The author carefully tracks the girl's growing self-confidence after Celeste, an outgoing new girl who instantly becomes a member of the elite group, befriends Lauren and convinces her to run with her for co-treasurer in their class elections. Unlike Lauren, basking in the glow of her new popularity, readers will pick up on the numerous clues that the manipulative, plotting Celeste is hardly trustworthy. Strasser caps his story with a believable denouement, in which Lauren learns a painful lesson about the value of genuine friendship and of confidence that comes from within.

The son of a solicitor, he qualified as a barrister while still finding time to contribute stories to theWindsor Magazine. After the First World War, however, he gave up legal work in favor of writing full time. He went on to complete some thirty books ranging from light-hearted farce to adventure thrillers. The Berry series established Yates’ reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances, and he was also very successful with the thriller genre though the character Richard Chandos. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates’ books encompass the genteel life—a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors, and he regularly featured in bestseller lists and was greatly admired by both readers and fellow authors.", "related": [], "rank": 2651732, "title": "The Courts of Idleness (B-Berry Pleydell)", "author": "Dornford Yates", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The real treasure, however, is not art but something presumably hidden in one canvas: a long-missing document detailing WW II crimes of several prominent Afrikaners active in the Broederbond, the nation's most powerful political organization. The search for the \"missing sixth\" soon involves Michael Meade, an American journalist and widower trying to resurrect his career in South Africa. He knows that various members of the Broederbond are eager to have the information for their own purposes, and that one of these, Gideon DeBruin, was responsible for Meade's father's death during the war. His desire for revenge is complicated by his growing attraction to DeBruin's daughter, Farrell. Aided by a pair of idealistic black journalists, Meade and Farrell wend their way through a maze of murder and deception, plots and counterplots until painstaking detective work leads them to Amsterdam and the truth about the missing papers. It takes a daring gamble upon their return to South Africa to see justice done. Close attention is required to keep track of all the developments, but the novel's unusual setting and memorable characters reward the effort.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2305859, "title": "The Missing Sixth", "author": "Mark Graham", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since the elder Kim's death in 1994, the country's political structure has evolved. The younger Kim is undoubtedly powerful but has neither his father's revolutionary credentials nor his personal charisma and does not always succeed in imposing his views. It is these policy debates that lie behind the apparent abrupt swings from engagement to non-engagement, not some inherent irrationality in the North Korean polity, and it pays to study them. This stimulating and well-written book does just that. It should be required reading for all those interested in or involved with North Korea.(J. E. Hoare, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and coauthor ofNorth Korea in the Twenty-First Century)It is conventional wisdom that information on North Korea is hard to come by, but in fact, the opposite is true. Most researchers quickly find themselves drowning in information, and the real challenge is to make sense of the deluge of data and separate the wheat from the chaff. Patrick McEachern rejects easy routes and embraces the project of using sound social science methodologies to examine a mountain of primary sources. The result of his painstaking analysis is the illumination of domestic politics in Pyongyang-opening up the \"red box.\" While McEachern's findings can be disputed, they cannot be ignored-this book is a must read for any serious student of North Korea.(Andrew Scobell, Senior Political Scientist, RAND Corporation)...deserve to be added to the list of essential readings on the modern politics of North Korea...(Marc LanteigneInternational Affairs1900-01-00)This is a brilliant book that should be read by anyone with an interest in Korean affairs.(Survival)", "related": [], "rank": 2399295, "title": "Inside the Red Box: North Korea's Post-totalitarian Politics (Contemporary Asia in the World)", "author": "Patrick McEachern", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An enduring feature of a good\nstory is the author's capacity to spin not only a tale but also a vision -- a\nsurrounding where good and evil play out their parts. The plot leads you to a\nconclusion with skillfully planted clues, employs a sense of the setting so\nreal that the reader feels a part of the place and uses dialogue that reveals\nthe minds and souls of the characters in it. Victim will linger in your mind long after you've closed the\nbook. The greed of yesterday is really no different from today, neither are the\nmethods, the intent, the lies, the cruelty and the cowardice. Perhaps only the\ntools are more deadly. Filled with chilling realism, Victim is a gifted piece of\nwriting.", "related": [], "rank": 1445526, "title": "Victim (An Emily Taylor Mystery Book 2)", "author": "Catherine Astolfo", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 29.0}

He and those around him grasped at a new world unfolding before them while clinging to the doubts and fears of the past, the past and present often presenting an incongruous state. In adulthood and while working on his bachelor's degree in night college, a professor took him aside and said words of magic: \"You can write, and I think you should do it.\" Charles writes in an easily understood style that brings to life characters who are both colorful and descriptive with whom the reader can easily identify, yet without the crudeness and vulgarity that plague many writings today.

I was twenty four years old, having a vampire movie marathon, when something hit me. Nearly all the vampire stories/movies were a love story, or they were good, or hated everything about themselves. A little voice in my head said, “what’s going on, vampires aren't good, they're evil!”   But from that thought, a character popped into my head, an evil, sadistic vampire wanting to conquer human and vampire kind!  When I write, I feel as though I'm giving life, not just to the characters that would not exist without me, but to myself.

I know most people do. They slave over it, nurture it and some claim to suffer for it. I didn't do any of those because Emily Washburn was small at birth. She began life as a short story called \"The Rose,\" which was written as part of a writers group exercise containing many stores of little black dresses. My idea for the story came from watching the Cannes film festival and seeing a beautiful woman on the arm of a man who had the head of a robber's dog. Their pairing was so incongruous that I considered, paid escort aside, that the woman must be other than human. From this, the character of Jacqueline du Pre was born. The name, of course came from a wonderful cellist who just happened to have a beautiful white rose named after her. To balance the beauty of the rose, I looked at the other end of the spectrum and found an obese frump. This character became Emily Washburn.The eclectic mix of little black dress stories was sent to a publisher with strings of hope attached. Alas, the strings were returned broken but there was a comment in the rejection letter indicating that \"The Rose\" had the potential to be the basis of a novel.I had not considered turning the short story into a novel so, for some considerable time afterward, Emily languished in the forgotten spaces of a computer file. I didn't even look at it again until I started getting feedback on stories that I was sending to friends from France and Italy when I was on a year-long sojourn. Each month I'd send an e-mail with three sections, namely, the good the bad and the quirky. It was the quirky that generated the feedback. The stories were about people, places and strange sightings.When I returned to Australia I was encouraged by friends to try to turn my adventures into something publishable. For some reason I looked at writing a non-fiction narrative about the quirky and try to have them published in magazines as short stories After all, once you realise that a stale baguette attains the consistency of granite or that, in the middle of summer, a man can be seen strolling the street of Nice wearing an army greatcoat and leading his cat on a leash or that some people dress dogs up in bonnets and pinafores and wheel them around in prams, you will find that there is fertile ground for tales of the slightly odd.I tried to write the events as short stories but they weren't as amusing as I would have hoped so I looked at turning the stories into fiction and creating a narrative around the events. At that stage I wasn't connecting the stories to the \"The Rose\" but seeing them as a combination of loosely linked separate events.I returned to France and during this trip, in the town of Mazamet, I saw a woman who fitted my image of Emily. She was with a beautiful young woman and was berating a young man who had the hang dog expression of someone who would rather be elsewhere. From this chance sighting, the character of Scott Mawson was formed and I began to see the characters that I had written as Emily's flowers and the narrative took shape. From that time I saw the novel and knew that it had to be completed.Readers of the novel will find that \"The Rose\" still exists. It now forms the last chapter of the novel.", "related": ["B0078HYCU2"], "rank": 3904382, "title": "The Garden of Emily Washburn eBook", "author": "Barry Dean", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A sennight had passed since her visit to the waterfall and she was growing anxious to make another journey there. Unfortunately, her betrothed had gotten it in his head to move them to his MacGregor kin's holding and he would not let go of the notion. He'd visited her several times each day with some new enticement to change her mind, making it impossible to leave the village without raising questions of her whereabouts. Jesslyn tried once more to reason with him. \"I think it not a good idea to move Alleck again so soon. He's only just settled in here at the Maclean holding and he adores your grandmother. And I'm not ready to make such a change this early, either.\"\"My sweet, can you not see that our presence is unnecessary here? That I am needed urgently at the MacGregor holding, as evidenced by the missive I received this morn from my uncle--stepfather--begging my assistance? There are duties that the MacGregors need me to perform for them and I should hasten to answer that request. I feel duty-bound to do so.\"Jesslyn worried her bottom lip with her teeth. This was Callum's newest ploy, and 'twas a good one. She was having trouble finding good reasons to convince him to avoid his duty to his father's clan. In all honesty, Jesslyn had begun to doubt her decision to wed him. Even tho' he had become a dear friend to her, and Alleck was slowly warming to him, the passionless kiss they'd shared a few days past concerned her greatly. Especially when compared to the heated embrace she'd shared in the wood with the black-haired warrior--who, she was ashamed to admit, had been invading her thoughts, and swaying her purpose as well. Jesslyn came to an abrupt halt.Callum broke stride and turned, giving her a questioning look.Taking both of his hands in her own, she straightened her spine and forced the words past her lips. \"Callum, I have thought on this these past days and I have decided to break our betrothal.\"Callum's eyes widened. \"What?\" He tried to pull his hands free.She would not let them go. \"'Tis truth, we love each other not, so this cannot be so very painful for you.\"\"Nay, I'm more stunned than hurt. Why have you changed your mind? Is it the prospect of leaving this place?\"\"Aye--but 'tis not the full of it. You know this is not working--for either one of us. You should go to the MacGregor holding, as you have said you must, but you must do it without Alleck and me.\"* * *Callum turned and walked a few paces away, his thoughts in turmoil. After a moment, a sense of relief filled him. Jesslyn had had the courage to admit their mistake, where he had not. For the past days had been very revealing to him. Tho' he liked and admired Jesslyn, he'd only recently begun to realize that they were not well matched in temperament. Why, only a few days past, he'd tried deepening one of the rather chaste kisses he'd given her and she'd grown cold and rigid in his arms. That had worried him. For, tho' they might not love each other, he was a man like any other. He had needs that he expected his wife to fulfill, with passion, if not love. Besides, he wanted a houseful of bairns. How was he to accomplish that, if there was no enjoyment in the making of them? He turned back to her then and, nodding his head, he at last replied, \"Aye, you are right. 'Tis for the best that we break the betrothal.\" He moved toward her. Placing a hand on her cheek, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to the other. \"My thanks to you for your wisdom and your courage to say what I would not.\"As he began to straighten, Jesslyn turned her head and kissed his cheek as well, a relieved smile on her face matching his own. \"We are friends? Say we are still friends.\"\"Aye, we are still friends, fair Jesslyn.\"* * *Callum departed for the MacGregor holding the next day, heart-sore for Maryn but looking toward the future. For 'twas time and past for him to find his place in the world and, tho' it had been hard to say farewell to the Maclean clan and especially his beloved grandmother, he knew his destiny lay with his MacGregor kin.* * *\"'Tis for the best, Lady Maclean.\" Jesslyn nervously fidgeted with the small strip of linen that Maryn had so graciously tied around her needle-punctured finger as she watched the older woman make a knot at the end of a length of thread. \"It became clear the longer we knew each other that we were suited more as friends than as a wedded pair.\" Lady Maclean and Maryn had finally allowed Jesslyn a reprieve from the task of sewing shirts for the babe after she'd bloodied one of them to a point where it now was in the rag pile.Not looking up from her rapidly moving fingers, Lady Maclean replied, \"Aye, I wondered when you would come to that conclusion. I worried for a time that 'twould be after you'd wed before you realized the mismatch. Tho', in looks, the two of you were quite well together.\"Maryn folded another of the finished garments and placed it in the basket at her feet. \"I'd just gotten used to the idea of the two of you as a couple and now 'tis done with, and Callum has left for good. My head spins with all these sudden changes.\"Lifting her gaze to the window, Jesslyn looked out at the position of the sun and decided she should get back to her chores if she was going to complete them by the time her son came home. \"I'm glad you understand and support my decision to break the betrothal. 'Twould not please me to cause you grief or vexation.\" Rising to her feet, she said, \"I must fly. I've work to do before my son returns.\"At the door, she turned back to the two ladies. \"My apologies for ruining the fine cloth, Maryn. Mayhap I can repay you with a raspberry tart? I could bring it to you this eve, if you like--and for you as well, Lady Maclean.\" \"Aye, we'd enjoy that,\" Maryn said.* * *After the door closed behind Jesslyn, Lady Maclean spoke. \"Callum took the glad tidings of your coming babe very hard. He has had tender feelings for you for almost as long as he's known you, and he was already hurt by your father's rejection of his suit to you and then your subsequent marriage to his cousin.\"Biting her lip and repositioning herself on her stool, Maryn replied, \"I had no idea his feelings ran so deeply for me. Even when he tried the blackmail scheme with my papa. Oh, he did confess once to care for me, but, 'tis truth, he's always been so extravagant in his attentions to all the ladies that I could not take him seriously. Besides, he was rather sotted on uisge beatha at the time.\"Lady Maclean nodded her head. \"Aye, but he truly did want to wed you, even tho' his means of attaining his ends were not noble.\" She sighed as she closed off the final stitch in one portion of the piece of linen. \"He was spoiled by us all as he grew. He's always been such a fine-looking lad and the lasses always did swarm around him. He's had very little experience with rejection and he's had more than his share in these past moons. Rejected both by his clan and his secret love.\"\"Oh, Grandmother Maclean, when you put it in those words, I feel so sorry for my part in his despair. I counted him as a friend for many years, at least until I became so vexed with his careless attitude regarding his duties here. But I believed we'd mended our friendship these past sennights.\" Maryn sighed, recalling her words to him by Fia's stall that day he'd shown her the cave. \"Tho' I was a bit cruel to him when he first arrived back, I think.\" Maryn rested the unfinished shirt she was working on in her lap and looked at her mentor.", "related": ["B007RB318S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the foreword, Julie Andrews and Emma Walton Hamilton write, \"a lullaby is an offering of love,\" and this project, with its approximately 100 contributors, represents a whole lotta love. Dawson and Glucksman have assembled notable composers and lyricists, singers and musicians, as well as illustrators to work on each song-Jules Feiffer, Barry Moser, Melissa Sweet, Jon Muth, and Marc Simont are some of the stellar artists. The contributors' notes make for exciting reading. Lullabies of many varieties and hues include \"It Takes All Kinds\" by Stephen Sondheim; \"It takes bimbos,/It takes dumbos/It takes rambos/And Columbos\" is sung with a poignant earnestness by Dana Ivey and Walter Charles. A few are heart-wrenching, such as a song for a baby surrounded by tubing and wires, wearing \"the tiniest onesie of them all\" (music by Wayne Barker; lyrics by BD Wong). Feel-good songs include Michael La Chuiusa's meditation on parenthood: \"How much love can a heart hold/Before it fills and overflows\" and the classic \"The Man Who Invented Ice Cream.\" This collection is perfect for a shower, as an elementary classroom read or listen, or as a gift of comfort and love.-Teresa Pfeifer, Alfred Zanetti Montessori Magnet School, Springfield, MAα(c) Copyright 2011.

It is only after her husband is killed, her barn burned, and her cattle poisoned and shot, that Maggie turns, in desperation, to hired gun Seth Sackett.  A man Maggie believes has no conscience, Seth takes the job as protector of the ranch, but clearly makes his attraction to Maggie known and promises her they will soon be lovers.  Outraged, yet affected by his nearness, Maggie is certain such a prophecy will never come to pass.  She is still deeply effected by her late husband's death and will never betray their love.  While fighting the rival rancher she believes is responsible for her problems, Maggie also fights her growing attraction for Seth as she learns more and more about the man behind the gun. Seth has his own private demons to conquer, however.  His late father was a preacher, but a very sick man.  A sinner in his own right, he blamed his two sons and his wife for all evils and saw to their punishment until Seth's brother was dead and his mother badly beaten.  His father is the first to die by Seth's gun and, feeling no remorse for his actions, Seth is convinced he too is an evil sinner and in no way good enough for someone like Maggie. The couple's private battles must be won as well as the one against whoever is determined to get their hands on the two big ranches.  When the attacks become even more personal, Seth and Maggie fight together to ensure the safety of Maggie's family, and to capture the dream of a love destined to be.Though you may guess who the bad guys really are here, it is the motive for the attacks that keeps you guessing.  Ms. Sandifer delivers a truly enjoyable read that takes you inside the very real, very troubled feelings of her characters and leaves you rooting for them 'till the very end.  Ms. Sandifer focuses our attention on the characters themselves until they become like family, leaving us feeling justified and satisfied when the last page is turned.  Endearing characters from beginning to end!  Ms. Sandifer has the unique ability to look within the human spirit.  A tribute to man's determination to overcome the odds in his quest for love and acceptance.  Ms. Sandifer offers something for everyone.  An engaging talent that draws the reader in!  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00AQQXPWS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a somewhat contrived conclusion, Tymmon and Troff return to Austerneve in a blaze of glory, having rescued both Tymmon's father and the castle's long lost prince from a villain's dungeon.

Soon he hires on at a struggling ranch (as a blacksmith, to his disappointment), and before he knows it, he’s caught up in a nasty war between rustlers and ranchers. This is a no-frills, old-fashioned western—the kind in which a bully calls our hero “a stinkin’, lily-livered, belly crawlin’ coward”—with rough-hewn characters and a simple heroes-versus-villains story line (and a love interest, of course). If the dialogue were a bit more corny, or the prose a bit more purple, the book might almost read like a spoof, but in fact, it’s a thoroughly entertaining formula western, the kind of story that, if it was made into a movie a few decades ago, would have starred the young John Wayne (with Gabby Hayes as Texas Dunn, Lassiter’s curmudgeonly but lovable ranch cook).

Jürgen T. Rehm, The Lancet'This is a compassionate book written for anyone, generalist or specialist, who is likely to be caring for those who suffer from the misuse of alcohol. The text is comprehensive, well-written, up-to-date, and broad-minded. If you own only one book on alcoholism and its treatment this is the one to purchase.' George E.

As a practical, person-centred, empathic guide to helping people with alcohol problems, this beautifully written work remains the exemplar.' Jonathan Chick, Consultant Psychiatrist, Alcohol Problems Clinic, Edinburgh' ... highly readable ... an invaluable resource ... provides an authoritative grounding ... contains a wealth of readily accessible information ... essential reading for all workers in specialist drug and alcohol agencies.' Drug News'Being highly readable makes this book an invaluable resource to both specialist and generic practitioners in the caring professions ... an authoritative grounding ... contains a wealth of readily accessible information on drinking problems and is therefore essential reading for all workers in specialist drug and alcohol agencies'. Maudsley/Regional Drug Training Unit'Ever since it first appeared in 1982 this has been the book I have recommended as reading for colleagues working with alcohol-related problems for the first time. Happily the quality and the consistency of the writing remains unchanged. this is an ideal starter's text for those who are going to work clinically ... Its particular virtue is the sense of practical experience tested over a long period, presented in readily understandable form ... This text continues to be a must for anyone working in the field of alcohol misuse.' Bruce Ritson, Addiction Biology'The reputation of this book as the definitive text on the subject of treatment for individuals with drinking problems has been further enhanced by this excellent third edition ... this book is extremely well written and accessible throughout ... Everywhere individuals with drinking problems attend for treatment should have a copy of this book.'

Even as a teenager I used to make up children's stories as I put them to bed while baby sitting. They were always begging me for more, perhaps just to stay up late, perhaps because I used to include them in the stories.Illustrating children's books was an ambition that grew from the early seventies. My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": ["B00D7BVTIQ"], "rank": 2322062, "title": "Marianne the Mermaid (Book 1)", "author": "Viv Rosser", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I believe my love of medieval knights came about when my father built a wooden shield and sword for me to use in elementary school for some event. Through my school years I read hundreds (or thousands? - it's hard to recall at this point) of fantasy and science fiction novels. Comic books and super heroes came a bit later, although I recall seeing the Christopher Reeve Superman movies at a very young age (and loving them). Since my later teens I believe I've watched nearly every major fantasy, science fiction, and super-hero movie that has come out. I still love reading fantasy and science fiction, although I wish there were more novels based on superheroes. This is something that drove me to create my own supers universe and heroes in written form. I love supers, but I've always wanted more character depth than a comic book can provide. (Not to mention the immense length of time it takes for a comic series to do a story is just plain too long to me.) Writing is a hobby for me, I'm a full-time computer programmer and systems administrator for a small company. Fortunately the skills I've learned allow me to work with 3D programs to render the characters (and covers) for my books. My hope is to put out a number of novels each year, time allowing. At this point I'd like to grow the H.E.R.O. series with more novels, as well as continue work on the new World of Dur fantasy series I've begun with Necromancer's Ascent.", "related": ["B00EODEPBY"], "rank": 1744172, "title": "Necromancer's Ascent (World of Dur Book 1)", "author": "Kevin Rau", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I employ this overused phrase because it is the only one that appropriately captures this amazing and beautifully written creative journey that is, in fact, ‘a feat requiring great virtuosity or strength, often deliberately undertaken for its difficulty.’ Montejano is Sancho the chronicler who, after a thirty-year separation from his original fieldwork, returns to try to understand a small cultural and social space that is duplicated thousands of times worldwide and that consists of those most oppressed by economic and racialist ideologies and actions. These cultural and social spaces are made up of thousands, if not millions, seeking through their agencies to struggle against the forces of negation and reduction by which their basic humanity has been limited, constrained, and defined. Yet, like Don Quixote, they arise, as did the Brown Berets of the southwestern United States, from circumstances that undeniably would test the humanity of us all. Montejano gives us an unvarnished narrative of hope, struggle, and failure—the very marks of being human. But the work is also a revelatory ethnography that diligently marks the changes and shifts of the author in relation to the persons with whom he worked. This narrative is a personal history of the manner in which a social science has had to amend its reductionist premises to an engaged, unromantic, and grounded approach in which human beings, with all of their warts and failings, still strive for recognition and a place as part of the larger processes of political action. This work is one of virtuosity, in which the difficulty and complexity of the material could have drowned Montejano in romanticism or reductionist parody. This did not happen. Sancho’s Journal will be known for its singular attention to truth and to understanding ourselves and those with whom we interact, whether as social scientists or as human beings. (Carlos G. Vélez-Ibáñez, Regents’ Professor and Director of the School of Transborder Studies, Arizona State University)", "related": [], "rank": 2053906, "title": "Sancho's Journal", "author": "David Montejano", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A must for any curriculum.”—Stein Tønnesson, author ofVietnam 1946: How the War Began“In this meticulous autopsy of the fifteen months following the 1945 August Revolution, David Marr shows that Vietnam’s Communists did not shape, guide or control events to the extent they claimed and many others believed.Vietnam: State, War, and Revolutionis a profound analysis of social mobilization and state formation in extraordinarily fluid circumstances. A monumental contribution to the history of modern Vietnam and to the study of revolutionary post-colonial states.” —William S. Turley, author ofThe Second Indochina War: A Concise Political and Military History\"This is a fascinatingly broad, detailed, and fluent account of how determined Vietnamese revolutionaries created a postcolonial state in Southeast Asia in the mid 1940s, against the extremely severe odds of food shortages, foreign invasions, little international recognition, and colonial repression. No book about Vietnam has ever succeeded so well as this one in answering Thomas Carlyle's famous question about revolutions: What was it like to be there?\"—Alexander Woodside, author ofCommunity and Revolution in Modern Vietnam“Achieving independence from France was a stupendous Vietnamese achievement about which David Marr earlier wrote the prize-winning bookVietnam 1945: The Quest for Power(1995). Vietnamese establishing a viable government for the entire country as they faced the likelihood of another French military invasion was quite another challenge. Success, Marr demonstrates in this splendidly written and detailed new study,Vietnam: State, War, and Revolution, was never a sure thing. From this meticulously researched book, historians, political scientists, and students of revolution in all disciplines, Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese alike, will learn much about state-making in times of immense adversity.” —Benedict J.

He was educated in Chinese classics and martial arts. Wang intended to start a rebellion against the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty, which ruled northern China then. According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48, he met two Taoist immortals in a tavern, Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin. They trained him in secret forms of Taoism. He changed his name to \"Zhe\" and adopted the Taoist name \"Chongyang\". In 1160, Wang met one of the immortals again and was provided with a set of written instructions called \"Ganshui Xianyuan Lu\". Those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples (Ma Yu and Tan Chuduan). Wang built a tomb for himself near Mount Zhongnan and called it \"Tomb of the Living Dead\". He lived in it for three years. At the end of the three years, Wang filled the tomb with earth and built a hut on top of it and called it \"Complete Perfection Hut\". He spent the next four years in the hut studying Taoism and imparting his knowledge to others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan, who became his disciple after he cured Tan from illness. Qiu Chuji and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang and founded five Taoist congregations. Wang's teachings were referred to the \"Teachings of the Complete Perfection\" (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the Quanzhen School. In 1167, Wang burnt down the hut and travelled east to Shandong, where he met Ma Yu and Ma's wife, Sun Bu'er. They became his disciples as well. He accepted a total of seven disciples who later became known as \"Seven Masters of Quanzhen\" or \"Seven Elders of Quanzhen\".

Today there are thousands of schools, clinics, farms and other organizations involved in practical work based on his principles. His many published works feature his research into the spiritual nature of the human being, the evolution of the world and humanity, and methods of personal development. Steiner wrote some 30 books and delivered over 6000 lectures across Europe. In 1924 he founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, stabbing, poisoning or simply battering a person to death.  As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My series ‘Death in the Pyrenees’ comprises, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees,' 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,' 'Red Light in the Pyrenees', 'Dead End in the Pyrenees' and 'Deadly Degrees in the Pyrenees'.  They are all set in a small town in France.  These novels are published by Author Way Limited.  Author Way has also  published, 'The Unravelling of Thomas Malone' which is set in Scotland, as well as a collaboration of short stories written with author Zach Abrams titled 'Twists and Turns', and, written together with author Angi Fox, the darkly humourous novel, 'But Billy Can't Fly'.  As I live much of my life in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration for my books which are set there, from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim.  But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there. Alternatively read about life on some of the toughest streets in Glasgow or for something more varied delve into my short stories.

In the current social media climate, this is a must for all educators!(Eric Jensen, author of Teaching with the Brain in Mind, and international consultant on brain-based learning)As the Olympics commentators say, 'Zarra nailed it!' The 'it' is the current reality of American schools and the changing relationships between teachers and students. Dr. Zarra lays out the new world of sexting, bullying and sexual manipulation, and the eroding of authority and boundaries in our classrooms. This blockbuster book is a must read both for those entering the teaching profession and older educators wondering what is happening to the school environment.(Kevin Ryan, Founder of the Center for Character and Social Responsibility, Boston University)Zarra’s book is the map you’ve been waiting for—clear, accessible, useful, and well aimed. You’ll find the volume full of examples, principles, and sound advice—a captain’s guide to charting the deep waters of moral reasoning, of practical wisdom, of tutored intuition, and of interpersonal obligations—all in the context of modern and postmodern education, whether online or in person. Furthermore, one of the greatest strengths of Zarra's book is its ability to articulate sound educational and pedagogical reasons without descending habitually into the mind-numbing morass of education-speak, and the affected jargon that too often beclouds rather than illumines the truths under review.(Michael Bauman, Professor of Theology and Culture, Hillsdale College)High school teacher and education theorist Zarra investigates how young adult brains process emotions and how the use of technology impacts mental maturity. In rethinking how educators address the topic, Zarra provides guidelines for creating boundaries between students and teachers that simultaneously strengthen their relationships in appropriate ways. His discussion extends to topics of developing character in children and how the brain development of children influences their interaction with educators later in life. Readers of Thomas Lickona’sCharacter Matters and Educating for Characteras well as Eric Jensen’sTeaching with the Brain in Mind and Brain-Based Learningwill find Zarra’s intersections useful. VERDICT The practical guidelines mostly boil down to common sense; however, the author illuminates the topic with neuroscientific research that stages a forum for a continued dialog.(Library Journal)", "related": ["B006SLYXLM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm so grateful for the wonderful life I live.I get the most satisfaction from being free. I have the time freedomandfinancial spaceto do whatever I feel like doing whenever I feel like doing it.But more than this my greatest satisfaction comes from living alife of purpose- onpurpose.Myhappinesscomes from being able to live a life based on \"daily creation\" rather than one based on \"daily need\".My \"purpose\" satisfaction comes from assisting people to improve their lives, both personally and economically.My fundamental motive for helping people is joy. I get more joy from seeing people solve their financial challenges, remedy their problems, end their frustrations, achieve their goals and enjoy their adventures than I do from anything else.When you've got the ability to help people get the results they want, there's no greater gift and there's no greater reward that I can feel.If I look back over my history, I've probably reinvented myself half a dozen times over the past 50 years so I know what it's like for people wanting to change. And I know the fears they feel because I have felt similar fears.I've felt theclaustrophobic fearsof doing day in and day out mundane jobs, and I've felt thefearsof an uncertain future. I've felt the fears of people having control over me and I've felt the fears of being devalued to the stage where I felt as though I almost had to beg for a living.Because I've felt these fears, I decided to wrestle back control of the direction of my life by setting out to live a morepurposefulandcreativelifestyle.Now wealthy in my own right, I devote much of my time to helping people just like you to become wealthy.I love working with people who areready for changebecause they really get it; they really get that they can do something different and they're motivated to learn. Sadly though, most people are not ready for change and they continue to live with 'the amount of discomfort they can satisfactorily handle on a daily basis'.When I ask 80 and 90 year olds if they arefinancially freeas a result of all they have learned in their lives, and if they are fit and if they are happy, the answer to all three questions is likely to be 'no'.The greatest gift I can give anyone is access to greater wealth and wellness. If I'm successful with wealth and wellness, then indirectly, I can help people with morefreedom,happinessandconnection, but only if they are ready for these outcomes.I don't believe that I can have a significant impact on the 80s and 90s generation, but I can have a significant impact on a generation of 'Baby Boomers' and on Generations X and Y who are open to change in a financial and lifestyle sense.In order to achieve personal andfinancial freedom, you need new information that's relevant to where you're at right now. You also need aproven formulato follow becauseproven formulaswork.On top of that you need \"space\" to engage relevant information, (you need head space, emotional space, psychological space etc) along with good support and the \"space\" to practice what you're learning.And that's where I come in; I give people information, provide the space, offer the support and watch over their practice so that they don't make costly and time consuming mistakes.", "related": ["B00DNINMTM"], "rank": 1633557, "title": "The Psychology of Wealth", "author": "Paul Counsel", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The poems are all written in free verse and teach us how to go on a path of intellectual, mental, and spiritual growth.I enjoyed reading the poems. Poetry is always interesting because each poet has their own way of expressing their observations and thoughts. That means, although the emotions are the same, the way of presentation and the way of expressing them will be unique and will reflect the individuality of the poet. The poems stay true to the title, Expectations. All the poems are about relationships and our expectations. The author has managed to deal with the truth and write an emotional collection of poems that is soul-stirring and heart-rending for the readers.The love poems like 'Desert Prince' and 'Our Life' show the softer and romantic side of the poet. 'Closure' is a beautiful poem on the closing of a relationship. The poet has handled the theme very well without going overboard. The language is crisp, minimalist, and very effective. 'Parcae' has a lot of sadness in it. 'The Enchanter' speaks about passion and desire. That is again one poem where the poet has used minimalism to enhance the powerful emotions. I would recommend this book to poetry lovers. The emotions are connected and the poet handles a theme that all of us can understand very well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began: \"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and struggling with his past and future, is not new. I wanted to explore new areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the moral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive global conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made, willingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is my Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own. I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not because they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the opposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not believe in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil can be narrow.

You may be a small business owner, corporate executive, accountant,\nbusiness consultant, or healthcare expert. Or, you may be an individual with an\ninterest in learning the specifics of how much this legislation may cost a\nbusiness in taxes, fees, and penalties.If you are looking only for a simple overview of ObamaCare\nor a discussion of its many healthcare-related provisions, this book is not for\nyou.In order to write the book, I first read the tax-related\nsections of the two primary Acts that created ObamaCare. I then read the IRS\nfinal regulations and proposed regulations where final regulations have yet to\nbe issued. I then attempted to reduce the regulations to comprehensive but\nconcise descriptions and examples. Included in each chapter are the sources I\nused to create the text for that chapter.Hopefully, you will find this book to be an effective tool\nto gain an understanding of how a tax issue may affect a business. If you want\nmore information and feel comfortable reading rules and regulations, you will\nknow where to look. If you need professional assistance, you can use this book\nas a guide for discussions with your tax adviser.When evaluating how an item may apply to your situation,\nplease keep in mind that tax rules and regulations often change. That is\nespecially true with respect to the topics covered in this book because some\nIRS regulations are yet to be finalized and proposed regulations may be\ndifferent than final regulations.", "related": ["B00DT9KYV4"], "rank": 3613584, "title": "ObamaCare Taxes for Businesses - What You Need to Know!", "author": "Thomas Lynch", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Restless after completing a time-consuming biography, the retired professor heads for a two-week country vacation at the home of old friends Mollie and Ian Davidge. He is introduced to the village notables at a dinner given by the local squire, Sam Waldron, who is replicating a menu from the 18th century. Ernest Audley, solicitor; Felicity Mace, doctor; Brian Singleton, biochemist; Brian's well-known brother Luke, an author of thrillers; and 16 others are deep in conversation at the meticulously set table when Luke collapses, poisoned by cyanide. Police Inspector Roland, conveniently at the dinner, begins the classic investigation by interrogating all guests. Motives abound, and then another body is discovered in the town's pond. Andrew's intuition is happily utilized by the unimaginative Roland, who has worked with him before. Unfortunately, the villagers are a colorless lot, the plot convoluted and contrived and even Andrew seems bored with the proceedings.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B004H7SQD0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For half a lifetime I moved with the times and jobs until I settled on St. Augustine, Florida where I almost single-handedly renovated a hundred-year-old house in historic Lincolnville, a community established by freed slaves in 1866. In 1995 I put my career on hold to care for elderly and handicapped members of my family.  Once free of those responsibilities, I  moved to Central America with my companion dog, a Shar-pei named Simon. Simon and I lived in a small Pacific Rainforest village in a thatched-roofed bohio while making intrepid excursions into the Darian, the San Blas Islands and outer islands in the Pacific. Simon was a star! And within a few months understood commands in Spanish. Simon and I were living high on adventure until I got robbed twice and lost in the Pacific on a sail with a friend. Some big-mouthed fool at the Boat Club ratted me out to my kids. I got yanked back Stateside and my passport put under lock and key. So, I'm putting pen to paper once again, or I should say computer--if I ever master the darn thing. My adventures now are made with words, but along the way I'm meeting new people and making new friends and I love every frustrating minute of learning about our new Cyber-universe of books. Simon passed on and is cruising the Ozone with other well-loved companions. But, I have a new pup, Scottie, a pair of mousers who rule our home and a half-dozen fat, feral cats living on the rails of my back deck.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I absolutely love old buildings, particularly old homes, and think that we should try to restore and maintain these properties whenever possible. They are a part of the past that, unfortunately is fading, and should be kept and appreciated for all the things that happened during the period they were built and used. Areas like Savannah, GA and Charleston, SC have the support and the money to restore and maintain old homes and they are doing wonderful things. But small towns like Cochran, Vienna, and Hawkinsville, just to name a few, cannot afford to purchase and rennovate these types of homes and so they deteriorate to the point where they are no longer salvagable, and I think it is a travesty. I think bringing these grand old structures to people's attention with your photography and books will also help bring the type of appreciation needed to help restore them and save these valuable pieces of history. Thank you and keep up the good work --S. PageWanted you to know that the book arrived yesterday, and it is beautiful. You have a wonderful talent!

It certainly made poetry modern—“common” in diction, grammar, and subject matter while fully cognizant of the poetic past—as did no other phenomenon of its time. For once they had seen what this monstrously brutal new form of warfare was, soldier-poets determined to make readers appreciate its filth, pain, and horror. None were more conscientious about this than the British and Irish solder-poets, and it is their work that appears in Kendall’s new anthology. Kendall also includes poems by civilians who wrote most powerfully about war (Hardy, Kipling, and the now-obscure, then-famous Wilfrid Gibson) and several women who served in field hospitals and as ambulance drivers. The collection concludes with a sterling small treasury of “Music-Hall and Trench Songs” (Kendall admits to cleaning the latter up for general consumption). Kendall sketches the life of each poet included, glosses military jargon and slang terms as well as place names and literary allusions in the endnotes, and includes two previously unpublished poems by a personal favorite, the  composer-poet Ivor Gurney. A timely memorial and a great anthology. --Ray Olson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each time they saw each other,an event which occurred three times per week at the cafeteria, he would pretend he knew her. Meanwhile, all of Tamie's friends were careful not to reveal her name to him. When he finally admitted his ignorance of her name, he was astonished to learn the truth. And the rest is history.

They left their Kentish home in England over 190 years ago to make a new life for themselves in South Africa. Four generations later, in 1918, George Hudson was born in Benoni, near Johannesburg. His sister, Molly, was born fifteen months later - she was my mother. Thanks to their amazing memories, every incident I have written about in this book is based on their stories. I was born in Nakuru in Kenya and travelled the world extensively as a child with my parents. I am a retired British journalist, now living in the Loire Valley in France. I am the best-selling author of 'amuse-bouche', a collection of French recipes and photographs adapted for the British and American market. It is available on Amazon. I love to write, to cook, to entertain and to travel.  Personal Anecdotes: I have always had great admiration for my 1820 ancestors who, at the age of 20, set sail for foreign shores with no knowledge of what they were about to endure. I have a similar respect for my mother, who faced huge hardships and dangers in her childhood and young life. I was fascinated by the very close relationship she had with her brother. Before they died, both aged 91, they helped me piece together their story - and the story of their ancestors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I loved the early phrase, \"it would be like\nthe bird house in a zoo.\" I could imagine exactly how all the twittering young\nladies would sound. Some of the other phrases, like \"a permanent look of boredom\n- the default face of teenage girls\" are unique and wonderfully\ndescriptive. I like that Mr. Wild comes across as somewhat a hardass in\nthe beginning. I'm pretty sure I'm going to like this guy. The meeting of faculty and their introductions is a clever and very good way to\nlet me know about some of the key players without boring me. Their ways of\nintroducing themselves told me all I initially need to know about them in just\na few sentences. It also seems that Lisa is going to be the proverbial fly on\nthe wall, and I expect great insights from someone in a position to be easily\noverlooked.  The writing is strong and clear, and it's obvious that time has been\nspent in cleaning up any initial mistakes or editing errors, always much\nappreciated.It moved at a fast\npace, it gave just the amount of background I need to buy into the story, the\ncharacters are interesting, and it promises good things to come.ABNA Expert ReviewerI think it's a very\ninteresting concept. I also think that there are lot of very diverse background\ncharacters which will make the story even more fun to read.

Fisher, Jr., Ph.D.© July 9, 2014I want to thank those who have gone to the trouble of posting reviews of A GREEN ISLAND IN A BLACK SEA.I’ve learned a great deal from these reviews, especially the need for editing, which I am in the process of completing.My sense was that this story of an American family of parents born during the Great Depression, and from modest circumstances, but rising to the international stage in South Africa, in what Allen Drury called a “Very Strange Society” (1967) in his journalistic treatment of draconian apartheid, deserved telling.My first consideration was to publish it as a memoir, but decided otherwise when James Frey’s “A Million Little Pieces” (2005) ran into an Oprah Winfrey buzz saw when she featured the book in her book club, only to find it was not a memoir but a novel.Oprah excoriated the author claiming he “betrayed millions\" when he offered it as a memoir while novelizing its treatment.An author who embraces reality in his writing, while rejecting the formula novel approach, tests the credulity of the reader who wants to escape reality and not be reminded that people don't behave as formula novels might suggest.A GREEN ISLAND IN A BLACK SEA is a psycho-sexual novel of very real people and very real events in the year 1968 in the country of South Africa, a country then in the grips of apartheid.  It is not a novel of apartheid or an informational tour of apartheid, but a novel in the frame of apartheid and all that that portends.The protagonist of the story, Seamus “Dirk” Devlin, who simply goes by Devlin, is technically and professionally prepared for the assignment, but not psychologically or emotionally prepared for this challenge as it turns out.The story, as it develops -- more psychologically than chronologically -- shows that Devlin feels he has lost all his anchors of support with which he has been programmed – family, company, country, church and school -- and is left only with his wits, feeling betrayed by all that he once held as holy.Whereas typically one feeling so abandoned and betrayed might be expected to turn to alcohol or drugs, violence or crime, Devlin turns to love, philosophy, and dead authors, which are as natural to him as breathing in his introvert personality.Incredulously, given this deceptive burden, the assignment finds him hitting on all cylinders in the discharge of his function.In a word, Devlin is not the typical hero or anti-hero, or what the reader might expect in a story alleging to be fiction when the story couldn't be more real for all of it happened in 1968, when the twentieth century ended.As the story unfolds, Devlin shatters many of his sacred biases and taboos, which result in his rebelling against his culture and what that culture purports to be irrevocable and significant.Alas, Devlin is not a hero, nor is he an anti-hero.  Neither is he a saint nor a sinner because he rejects the validity of both, relegating his trust only to Nature, which has no conscience.Devlin is real, as is his family, as is H.B. Myers and Dr. Blanton Brightwater, as is Nina, Josiah, Gabriel and the Matthews.  They are real as are the events of the story.There is a managing director Cavendish of BAF, who will in fact rise to Managing Director of the new company formed by Devlin’s perseverance, a company that has become today a billion dollar enterprise in South Africa.I applaud Kindle for allowing this story to be told without pulling punches with the psycho-sexual energy of the times.A GREEN ISLAND IN A BLACK SEA is a story of nascent violence or dread, when the fear of no tomorrows finds the luxury class turning to self-preservation the way people have always behaved in the eye of possible annihilation, a violence and bloodshed to South Africa’s credit never occurred.  But in 1968, it was as palpable as the sweat on the brow.The twentieth century was the most violent century in the history of man, and predictably, it was also the most liberated psycho-sexual century in man’s history.In a mere 100 years, the world population increased from 1 billion to nearly 7 billion today, whereas it took 2,000 years for the world population to reach a billion souls.The book an author writes is never the book a reader reads.  This is the book I wrote.  I thought readers deserved to know what my intentions were.A GREEN ISLAND IN A BLACK SEA is not an esoteric work for the scholarly few but rather rooted in the lives of ordinary souls in extraordinary circumstances, offering a humane vision of a more tolerant and decent life in the postmodern world.  It is an ideal introduction for the uninitiated, accessible, richly argued, funny and, in a kind of devil's advocacy fashion, begging for rebuttal.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I feel very fortunate to have been invited on Stevie’s journey by my sister as the writing of these amazing stories has brought us closer together, not only as sisters but as friends.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book skews more urban fantasy than paranormal\nromance, especially in the first two-thirds. There's more action and\nhumor than anything else.Q - Violence?A - It's about the same level as the first two, just greater frequency.Q - Is this a novella?A - It started out that way, but ended up as a full-length novel! I just couldn't shut Cole up...Q - Where does HONESTY fall in the Mark of Nexus timeline?A - It overlaps the second half of COURAGE, so I sprinkled in a few\nrepeat scenes (different POV) to keep everyone oriented.
