He traces the genesis of the policy to the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, which made efforts at nondiscrimination in public works projects and the military. The Civil Rights movement birthed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as lingering questions about how to prove discrimination, how to enforce antidiscrimination orders and whether preferences were needed to overcome past discrimination. The zenith of affirmative action, it turns out, came under Richard Nixon, whose secretary of labor, George Shultz, required federal contractors to set goals and targets for minority employment. The concept soon wound up in the courts, and Anderson provides good summaries of relevant cases, from the 1978Bakkedecision to last year's cases involving the University of Michigan. The backlash began in the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, as enforcement lagged and the Justice Department sought cases to curtail affirmative action. In the 1990s, the rhetoric shifted to \"diversity,\" an easier concept for politicians to embrace, and university systems in California and Texas were forced to give up preferences. (The winners at select universities: Asians.) Many cities and businesses have institutionalized the policy, and affirmative action has created a very different workplace in 40 years—with little damage to firm competitiveness or fair employment practices, says the author. Still, Anderson concludes by acknowledging a host of questions about whom the policy should help. Though Anderson aims at an evenhanded tone, he could have paid more attention to notable polemics on this topic. He omits examination of affirmative action programs in the U.S. military and would have done well to at least note some international experiences.

We marvel at these 'flawless saints' while thinking, 'Wow! I'm not worthy!' Hey, not so fast. Believe it or not, the most celebrated people in the Bible were plagued by doubt, bad decisions, and less than perfect reputations. In a word, most were losers! And yet, God had plans that would take them beyond their humble, imperfect lives and dub them proud members of the 'losers' club. Losers Club is a real-life look at famous Bible figures such as Moses, Solomon, David, Thomas, Rahab, and others. Each vignette reveals people who struggle with weak faith, confusion, and frustration---people very much like you and me!

Skullduggery and intrigue ... behind the scenes at the annual convention of a church denomination. Much as the words skullduggery and intrigue drew me to the book, it was because my church denomination (which shall remain nameless except to let you know it begins with the letter B) has had its own problems over the last twenty or so years. And, I was curious if this book could, perhaps, be even remotely related to my denomination. Even though it is fiction, I thought by reading THE CONVENTION, I might better understand the problems and gain some insight into what caused the turmoil.   I got more than I expected!   Author Bob Wallace s behind-the-scenes look at the planning and managing of such a huge event was interesting to me. Having organized AT&T; shareholder meetings in the past, I had some idea of what he was talking about in staging such an event. But his attention to detail and wrapping the cast of characters into the event was testimony to his years of convention management and his knowledge of people. I only hope his cast of characters and their role in the story was more fiction than fact!   His cast of characters range in respectability from the capable and highly-respected Bill and Terri Ellis who are the Convention Managers for the church to The Rev. Dr. Max Hoffman, the lowest of the low and Secretary of the church. The other characters fall into this range of respectability and each has their own story. It s a rather straight-forward plot and, for the most part, each character and his or her role in the plot are quite believable.   It may surprise you to find yourself thinking of people who fit the mold of a particular character. Their personal goals, abilities, strengths and weaknesses are revealed to create an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the convention and the politics that are unseen and unknown by the convention attendees.  This is a story of people experiencing defining moments in their lives as they come together at the convention and how they respond to those moments. The events lead some of the characters to reach for greater things; others, as is the way of the world, are led to personal ruin, divorce and/or suicide.  Let me say to you now, the book was a page-turner.   Some books are read over a period of weeks or months. Others you can t put down. If you re an avid reader, you know what I mean.   THE CONVENTION is a can t-put-it down kind of book! You just have to see what is going to happen next and what the good guys are going to do to stop the bad guys from their skullduggery.  I wish you many days of good reading. --The MULLET RAPPER, MARCH 7, 2008I was hooked after the first page. It s the only book I have ever read that I didn t want it to end! I cannot bear waiting for the second book to come out. This left so much to look forward to and anticipation of the story that I know is coming next. --Betty Jennings, Gainesville, FLIt's the first book I have read without putting it down since I left school. --Mike Fuller, Naples, FL", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She tried to stand up straight against the intense, ice-blue stare of her boss, Luke Hunter. He wore the look some of his business rivals had compared to being pierced by a laser. She began to understand the feeling.Southern women have skin like magnolia blossoms and spines like steel.Gran's voice echoed in her mind.Have you lost yourself up north among them Yankees, Chloe Elizabeth?Maybe she had. She took a strained breath and met Luke's gaze. \"I don't know what you mean.\"He arched his black eyebrows. \"It's a simple question, Chloe.\" He held up a sheet of off-white notepaper covered with spidery handwriting. \"Why does your grandmother think you and I are a couple?\"Possibly, if she closed her eyes, she'd open them to find this was all a dream—no, a nightmare.Oh, Gran,she thought despairingly,whatever possessed you to write to him?Luke must have picked up the mail when she'd been out of the office for a few minutes. If she'd seen it— But she hadn't.Luke was waiting for an answer, and no one had ever accused Luke Hunter of an abundance of patience. She had to say something.\"I can't imagine.\"Liar,the voice of her conscience whispered. \"May I see the letter?\"She held out her hand, trying to find enough of that steel Gran insisted she had so that her fingers wouldn't tremble and give her away. Luke held the paper just out of her reach for a moment, like a cat toying with a mouse, and then surrendered it. He leaned back against the polished oak desk that the Dalton Resorts considered appropriate for a rising executive. He should have looked relaxed. He didn't.She shot a hopeful glance toward the telephone. It rang all day long. Why not now? But the phone remained stubbornly silent. Beyond the desk, large windows looked out on a gray March day in Chicago, an even grayer Lake Michigan. No sudden tornado swept down to rip the sheet from her hand.She forced her attention to Gran's letter. She'd barely begun to decipher the old-fashioned handwriting, when Luke moved restlessly, drawing her gaze inevitably back to him.She'd long ago realized that Luke Hunter was a study in contradictions. Night-black hair and eyebrows that were another slash of black contrasted with incredibly deep blue eyes. The strong bones of cheek and jaw reflected his fierce tenacity, but the impression was tempered by the unexpected widow's peak on his forehead and the cleft in his chin.It didn't take one of Gran's homegrown country philosophies to tell her what to think of Luke. A man with a face like that had secrets to hide. He wore the smooth, polished exterior that announced a rising young executive, but underneath was something darker, something that ran against the grain. She'd been his good right arm for nearly six years and had never seen more than a hint of it, but she knew it was there.She took a breath. \"I'm sorry that you received this.\" The paper fluttered in her grasp. \"I don't know why Gran decided to send you an invitation to her eightieth birthday party next Sunday.\"\"Oh, she says why.\" Luke leaned forward, invading her space. \"She thinks I'm your 'beau.'\" His tone put quotes around a word she'd never expected to hear from him. \"Why does she think that?\"\"My grandmother is an elderly lady.\" She would try to convey the image of someone frail and confused, while sending a fervent mental apology to her peppery Gran. No one who knew Naomi Caldwell would dare to call her frail or confused.\"She sounds pretty coherent to me.\" He plucked the letter back from her, and she had to fight to keep from snatching it. \"If she thinks that, it must be because someone gave her that idea.\"Please, Lord.She stopped the prayer before it could become any more self-serving than it already was. Obviously no heavenly intervention was going to excuse her from the results of her own folly.\"I'm afraid I must have.\" She picked her way through the words carefully, as if she were back on the island, picking her way through the marsh grasses. \"I think it happened when you gave me those symphony tickets. When I told her about it, she misunderstood. She assumed we went together.\"\"And you didn't correct her?\"She felt color warm her cheeks. \"I thought…\"Well, that sentence was going nowhere. Try again.\"My grandmother worries about me. You have to realize she's never been farther from home than Savannah. Chicago is another world to her. Once she thought I was dating someone safe, she stopped worrying so much.\"His eyebrows lifted. \"Am I safe, Chloe?\"She'd stepped in a bog without seeing it. \"I mean, someone she'd heard of. Naturally, I've often spoken of my boss.\" Probably more than she should have. \"I didn't tell her any lies. I just…didn't clear things up.\" It was time to get out of this situation with what remaining dignity she had. \"I'm sorry you were bothered with this. Naturally, I'll tell her you won't be coming to Caldwell Cove.\"Luke looked again at the letter, with some sharpening of attention she didn't understand.\"That's in South Carolina, isn't it?\"She nodded. \"It's on Caldwell Island, just off the coast.\"\"Caldwell Cove, Caldwell Island. Sounds as if you belong there, Chloe.\"The faint trace of mockery in his voice made her stiffen. \"I belongherenow.\"\"Still, to have a whole island named after you must mean something.\"\"It only means that my ancestors were the first settlers. They gave their name to the village and to the island. It doesn't mean every descendant stays put.\"Shehadn't.She held out her hand, hoping he'd give her that embarrassing missive so she could destroy it. \"Again, I'm sorry.\"But he turned away, dropping the letter onto his desk. He glanced back at her, amusement in his eyes. \"I'm not. It's been an interesting break in the routine.\"\"Speaking of which—\" She looked at her watch. \"You have a meeting with Mr. Dalton at eleven.\"\"No.\" The amusement disappeared from his face. \"He was in early and he talked with me then.\"It went without saying that Luke had been in early. She sometimes wondered when he slept. \"I see. Are there any meeting notes I should take care of?\"\"None.\" His voice contained an edge. \"Just get me the Branson file, that's all.\"He moved effortlessly back to Dalton Resorts business, obviously dismissing her and her small problems from his mind. She could escape. She'd reached the door when his voice stopped her.\"Chloe.\"\"Yes?\" She turned back reluctantly.\"Too bad I won't be seeing Caldwell Cove. It might have been fun at that.\"Fun?She tried to imagine Luke Hunter, urban to the soles of his handmade Italian shoes, in Caldwell Cove. No, she didn't think that would have been fun for anyone, least of all her. She gave him a meaningless smile and scurried out the door.Once safely behind her desk, she took a deep breath, trying to quell the flood of embarrassment.It's your own fault,the voice of her conscience said sternly, sounding remarkably like her grandmother.You set this in motion with your fairy tales.Fairy tales, that's all they'd been—innocent fairy tales. Letting Gran believe she and Luke Hunter were a couple had let her believe it, too, for a time. She shied away from that thought.She should have realized that sooner or later this would backfire. She pressed her fingers to her temples, trying to erase the pounding that had begun there. She'd known he'd never give up until he had the whole story. That tenacity of Luke's had played a major role in his success at Dalton Resorts.She'd seen that quality when she first met him, when she came to Chicago six years ago. His office had been the size of a broom closet then, and she'd been the greenest member of the secretarial pool, homesick for the island and trying to find her way through the maze of corporate politics.She'd learned fast, though probably not as fast as he had. She'd discovered that she had to get rid of her soft Southern drawl if she didn't want to be made fun of. She'd found that there were as many alligators in the corporate structure as she'd ever seen in the lagoons on the island. And she'd realized that if you wanted to survive, you attached yourself to a rising star.That star had been Luke Hunter, with his newly minted MBA and his fierce, aggressive intelligence. They'd come up together, working long hours, until they'd become a team, almost able to read each other's thoughts. She'd identified herself with his interests, and she'd never regretted that move. Until, possibly, today, when her two worlds had collided.She looked at the framed family photo on her desk, and warmth slipped through her.

She'd made friends, found a church home, learned her way around, but she'd never developed that sophisticated urban manner her friends wore so easily. Maybe the truth was, she was trapped between her two worlds, and she wasn't sure which one claimed her.But Luke Hunter didn't need to know that.

He died on January 6, 1919 at Oceanside, California, United States. At the age of sixteen years, refusing a foreseeable future among the nobility class, he left home to enter the ship-yards at Glasgow, Scotland in order to learn the engineering profession. He was soon chosen as Chief Engineer of a trading steamer, position which took him in trips all over the world and gave him a great deal of knowledge of the world and its people. For a number of years he was Chief Engineer on one of the large passenger steamers of the Cunard Line plying between America and Europe. From 1895 to 1901, he was an ill luck consulting engineer in New York City and during this time he married, the marriage being terminated by the death of his wife in 1905. A son and two daughters were born of this marriage. In 1903, Max Heindel moved to Los Angeles, California, in order to look for a job. Meanwhile, due to his earlier years that had been full of sorrow and to sad events in his own life, an increasingly intense desire to understand the cause of the sorrows and sufferings of humanity began to grow within him, as well as a desire to help alleviate them. Giving a new course to his life, he became interested in the study of metaphysics and, after attending lectures by the theosophist C.W. Leadbeater, he joined the Theosophical Society of Los Angeles.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is highly accessible, explaining ideas in the clearest possible language without compromising depth and complexity. Accordingly, it is a book that would work well for students at all levels. Undergraduates with no background in social theory will be able to easily engage with this text, and this is something that can not be said of any other contemporary social theory textbook that considers the range of theorists and complexity of ideas that this book does. More advanced students, including professional social theorists, will find that Elliott provides great clarity on some of the most difficult, yet most influential, ideas in contemporary social thought.\"–Ann Branaman, Associate Professor of Sociology Florida Atlantic University, USA\"It is very hard to write an outstanding introduction to any subject and particularly hard to do so for a subject as demanding as contemporary social theory. Anthony Elliott succeeds superbly. His book offers a reliable guide to the big debates in social theory while never glossing over the difficult questions.\"–Professor David Held, Co-Director, Centre for the Study of Global Governance, LSE, UK\"Magnificent. Elliot visits a vast range of theorists and shows how they reveal the beautiful complexity of everyday social life. He makes social theory relevant and meaningful, simple, sexy and exciting.\"–Tom Inglis, Professor of Sociology, University College Dublin, Ireland\"No one I know is better able than Anthony Elliott to get to the heart of complex theories, then to write of them clearly yet critically.\"– Charles Lemert, Andrus Professor of Sociology at Wesleyan University and author of ‘Thinking the Unthinkable’, USA\"This is an amazingly fluent analysis of contemporary social theory. It should be widely read for its careful and insightful dissection of the main theories and of their particular strengths and weaknesses. It will be a must-read on many ‘theory’ courses around the world.\"–John Urry, Distinguished Professor, Dept of Sociology, Lancaster University, UK\"Intelligent and lucid, Anthony Elliott’s introduction to Contemporary Social Theory provides a remarkably complete overview of thinkers and themes. In exploring the organizing question – what is society?- he skilfully guides the student through a galaxy of major figures including such luminaries as Bauman, Butler, Chodorow, Foucault , Giddens, Habermas, Lacan, and Lemert. Incorporating many valuable pedagogical aids, Elliott makes social theory highly accessible.Contemporary Social Theorybristles with insights into our troubled world.\"–Bryan Turner, Alona Evans Distinguished Visiting Professor of Sociology at Wellesley College USA\"This is quite simply the best introduction to contemporary social theory that I have read. Profound and subtle in its judgements, yet very easy to read, Anthony Elliott has done much more than rehearse familiar debates or identify key thinkers. He has brought contemporary social theory to life by placing it within everyday experiences, troubles, and dilemmas. And he has done so with a remarkable breadth of theoretical virtuosity covering everything from sexuality to globalization, language to political institutions and governance. This book will be invaluable to students and teachers alike.\"–Professor Robert Holton, Fellow of Trinity College Dublin, Ireland\"Anthony Elliott is without question one of the leaders in the younger generation of sociologists. Contemporary Social Theory provides an overview of various recent sociological theories and is an essential text for anybody interested in sociological theories including Japanese students and faculty.\"–Professor Masataka Katagiri, Chiba University, Japan\"Here is the latest example of what Anthony Elliott does best: He brings his readers in on the key social, personal and political issues of our time. Always readable and interesting, Contemporary Social Theory: An Introduction includes a wide range of modern social thought, from structuralism, to feminism, to globalization, and engagingly demonstrates these theories' relevance in our own lives. As importantly, Elliott provides us a way to think critically, making the reader a more thoughtful reader of social theory as well as a participant in contemporary social debates. A book that is stimulating to both teacher and student alike and that enlivens the classroom experience.\"–Professor Jeffrey Prager, Sociology, UCLA, USA\"Anthony Elliott has written a wide ranging and appealing book, setting new standards for introductory texts in social theory.Contemporary Social Theoryis clear in style and accessible in presentation. It is sure to stimulate students and beginners in the field whilst proving of considerable interest to their teachers. It will also strike sparks with those with a professional research interest in social theory.\"–Professor Paul du Gay, Organisational Behaviour, Warwick University, UK\"Extraordinary in scope, Contemporary Social Theory takes the reader on a world tour of social theory since the Second World War and offers the student clear and accessible guidance around what are often complex and obscure theoretical edifices. More than this, Anthony Elliott provides not just description but evaluation and critique, and the originality of his mind will make this a pleasure to read for all thoughtful people engaged with the politics of living.\"–Professor Paul Hoggett, Director of the Centre for Psycho-Social Studies, UWE, UK\"The renewal of the teaching of social theory can now take place! For in Anthony Elliott's scholarly, thorough and limpid volume, teachers of theory have the perfect support text, one guaranteed to bring students fully into the exciting drama that it lays out: the drama of contemporary social life as social theorists from the Frankfurt School to Giorgio Agamben have mapped it out.\"–Professor John Lechte, Higher Degree Convenor (SOC) Macquarie University, Australia\"Social theory gives us the building blocks to make sense of our lives and explore how they link to the processes which shape what we can do and how we live. But it takes a master of the craft to turn the blocks into a building in which it is possible to live and flourish. This book shows that Anthony Elliott is a master of the craft.The house that is built within the pages of this comprehensive book is one of many rooms, in which all students will find a place in which they can think and, moreover, in which they will be given in an exceptionally accessible and well-informed style the resources which that thinking needs if it is going to succeed.I have little doubt that thanks to its encyclopaedic spread, authoritative content and keen eye for the excellent illustration, this book will be valued highly be everyone who wants or needs to think - and live - with social theory. And ultimately that means all of us.\"–Professor Keith Tester, Cultural Sociology, University of Portsmouth, UK\"Elliott provides a sweeping survey that is both accessible and sophisticated. Organised in thematic chapters that make excellent use of vignettes from the lives of everyday people to draw the reader into the issues, Elliott elegantly summarises the main points of each theorist's work, provides some discussion that stretches the reader's understanding, and rehearses the main criticisms. The book weaves together the disparate strands of social theory, including psychoanalysis, feminism, (post)structuralism, and critical theory alongside the issues of globalization and postmodernity. This book will set the agenda for many university courses in contemporary social theory.\"–Professor Douglas Ezzy, Head of School, Sociology and Social Work, University of Tasmania, Australia\"For the last 20 years Anthony Elliott has been bringing his unique personal and intellectual insights to the major debates of our time, in an impressively wide-ranging series of texts on social theory and psychoanalysis. More recently he has produced a provocative series of works on risk and globalization, the allure of celebrity and plastic surgery, and the trials and terrors of the new individualism. Here, in his new introductory text, Elliott returns with new insights to some of the classics of social theory, and charts a path through the most interesting and important contemporary social theorists. I can think of few writers better equipped to carry off this task, and Elliott has done it here magnificently. Elliott combines his deep knowledge of social theory, his lightly worn erudition, and an engaging style that is a pleasure to read. The personal stories that begin most chapters were a highlight and manage to bring home what is at stake in the theories and ideas that follow. What he has achieved here should win over a generation of new students to social theory.\"–Anthony Moran, Lecturer in Social Sciences, La Trobe University, Australia\"Covering an impressive range of theories and theorists, and presenting them in an accessible and elegant fashion, reading Anthony Elliott’s text is an ideal way to navigate the often complex terrain of modern social thought.\"–Professor David Inglis, University of Aberdeen, UK", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spoke only French until he was five years old. Unfortunately for him, he lived in Brooklyn, New York at the time. The family moved to Long Beach, Long Island, a reclaimed sand bar south of the main island, separated by one bridge. A nearby neighbor was the Godfather, Frank Costello. Our city was advertised as The Safest City In The U.S.A. The author left home for the army and Virginia Tech. Marching out of step for the rest of his life, he attended six universities thereafter, until becoming a psychologist. Continuing his need for multiple experiences, he worked for the Veteran's Administration a Peace Corp. project, taught at four colleges and started a labor union for psychologists which still exists. He taught first year medical students about sex and interviewing and psychiatric residents about diagnosing and group therapy. He supervised two private counseling centers, trained two hundred psychiatrists and numerous other mental health professionals. He remarried and currently has six children and grandchildren. After retirement, he used his early experiences to manage money for select clients. Writing this book was a labor of love.

Lefargue found the genesis for his book while struggling through the aftermath of a failed engagement, during which he discovered Stevie Wonder's breakthrough double album, Songs in the Key of Life. Beginning with the miraculous turnaround that album inspired, the professor and Brooklyn resident recounts, among other amusing anecdotes, his mother's mad crush on mid-1980s sensation Billy Ocean; his own impressions and imitations of Michael Jackson, \"who danced like Fred Astaire, sang like Jackie Wilson, had the suave good looks of a young Sam Cooke, and dressed like Liberace\"; and the link between Stanley Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket and 2 Live Crew's \"obscene, misogynist, and offensive\" album As Nasty as They Wanna Be. The book's biggest weakness may be Lefargue's lack of credentials; without rock critic Sheffield's reputation or Hornby's fan base, readers may wonder why they should care about one man's taste in music.

The novella was somewhat creaky and simplistic, even by 1970s standards (its anti-Communist screed belonged in the 1950s), but it did have plenty of room for action. (Surprisingly, given Smith's talent for creating notable villains, the archnemesis never appears onstage in the novella; I remedied this in the novel version.) Smith had created no further plots, characters or story arcs, so I had to add my own original touches as I wrote nine brand new books set in that universe, thus creating what became known as the \"Family d'Alembert series.\"    As the decades passed, I became increasingly dissatisfied with these books. The stories I told were fun, but like a tree planted in infertile soil it was stunted and unable to reach its full growth potential. Finally, in the late 2000 aughts, I decided to re-invent the series completely into what is now theAgents of ISIS.    I discarded \"Imperial Stars\" in its entirety. Gone are Smith's universe, Smith's characters, and Smith's simplistic world view (with the equally simplistic pseudo-Lamarckian evolution that led to the characters' greater strength and speed). I wrote an entirely new first novel,Tsar Wars, to kick off the re-envisioned series, introducing a new universe with new problems, a new background, and deeper, more three-dimensional characters. The stories and characters I created for Books 2 through 10 of the original series are basically the same, though I made major adaptations so they'd fit the new universe.    While I won't try to pretendAgents of ISISis ultra-realistic--it still has its feet rooted firmly in the space opera tradition--I believe it's not quite as black-and-white as Smith's novella made it out to be. And there's still plenty of exciting action to keep the reader moving forward.    Tsar Warsis Book 1 of theAgents of ISISseries, replacingImperial Starsfrom the Family d'Alembert series. I'll freely admit I borrowed some of the plot from Mark Twain'sThe Prince and the Pauper, and I blatantly appropriated one of Mr. Twain's greatest lines. (Only steal from the best!) The quote is so famous, though, that it scarcely needs attribution.    If you're a fan of thee original series, I hope you'll giveAgents of ISISa try to see how I changed it. And if you haven't read the Family d'Alembert series before, I urge you to try the new, improved series instead. I think it's better designed and better written--and loads of fun.", "related": ["B00G0OYZRO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lisa Ann left Detroit in 1991 and spent the next 14 years exploring a variety of jobs (including as a product trainer for Cadillac), traveling the world and writing. She settled down in 2005 in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where she lives today. Her first novel, \"Flower of Fire\", a thriller about a modern-day Typhoid Mary, was published in October 2010. A collection of 18 poems, \"Incantations\" followed in 2011. Her newest book, a memoir of her early adulthood in Detroit, was published in the summer of 2013 and is available in both paperback and e-book on Kindle.

If you love the thrill of safaris this book is for you. It is full of hair-raising stories of escape and adventure in the bush.

From earliest childhood Tonio Kroger is aware of his separation from other people, in particular his two schoolmates Hans Hansen and Ingeborg Holm, who represent the bourgeois norm, symbolized by their blond good looks. Tonio longs to be accepted into their company, but his artistic nature will not permit him to fully join their ranks. As Tonio grows older his talent matures and he becomes a writer, but he still feels like a stranger and yearns to fit into the world. He continues to be preoccupied with the essential dichotomy between life and art, between personal happiness and the discipline that leads to great achievement. These themes are known to have obsessed Mann throughout his career, and Tonio Kroger is almost certainly a representation of the author's persona.  --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rachel travels to her hometown, St. Louis, when her former boss requests that she look into the suicide of lawyer Stoddard Anderson. If Anderson is judged sane at the time of his suicide, his widow will be denied extra benefits under his life insurance policy. Since Anderson anonymously moved into a hotel three days before he was found dead in the bathtub, his state of mind at the end is in question. By interviewing the people Anderson saw in the week before he secluded himself, Rachel discovers that he was in the middle of a shaky multimillion-dollar transaction. Apparently Anderson found and hid a jewel-encrusted artifact that U.S. Customs, a representative of the Mexican government and an American religious fanatic each would like to have. Having access to Anderson's records, Rachel decides to find the artifact herself. Despite her tough professional image, Rachel acts like a teenager around a handsome New Mexico lawyer; her waffling about whether the artifact should be returned to the Mexican government or sold to the highest bidder further diminishes her credibility.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When a philandering business tycoon named Ephraim Purcell is murdered while the sheriff is away on business, the doctor offers to track the killer. But before he can break in a new, infatuated nurse and mend a misunderstanding with his lady friend Olive Wade, Deacon finds himself having to sort through a bewildering array of suspects, including a financially ruined blacksmith and Purcell's own vengeful stepdaughter. While Deacon's latest case lacks the spark of his previous one, McKay's period detail and crisp, engaging prose will satisfy fans of well-crafted historical mysteries. -- Booklist, July 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": 2574448, "title": "Miser of Cherry Hill (Dr Clyde Deacon Book 2)", "author": "Scott MacKay", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sired 20 to 25 offspring with many lemans (mistresses). You can imagine them trying to sort out which child belonged to which woman. It must have been a great chore. The records ended with the names of eighteen acknowledged and documented children listed with their supposed mothers. (They weren't sure they were accurate.) He must have had \"bed sport\" amnesia about the other five or seven unacknowledged bastards!Since Henry I had so many bastards, why not give him one more and make him the villain of the story? I named him Julian of Durham and pretended he was the only child the king refused to acknowledge. I gave him a good excuse, though. Julian had an amazing likeness to a commoner seen sneaking out of his leman's window one night. When the king heard of it, I doubt he visited her again. But that didn't stop the woman from raising Julian of Durham to think he was a true son of Henry I and deserved titles and lands like his supposed half-brothers and sisters. He made a great villain.When Stephen usurped England from the Empress Matilda, their struggle resulted in a long civil war known as the Anarchy. Baron Warin de Burgh held Seton Castle, the particular castle Julian coveted. Twas the perfect time for Julian to wrest Seton Castle from Baron de Burgh, but he hadn't counted on a woman so determined to save her people as the Baron's wife, our Letia de Burgh.Baron de Burgh never sired a child, so he was in desperate straits knowing his heart was failing.

The Mind Man is an intriguing delve into the power of our mind as a police sergeant finds out the complete extent of the mind's potential. A risk delves him deep into the world of thoughts where the truth is anything but the most mundane of things. Fast paced reading that will prove hard to put down, The Mind Man is fascinating, and highly recommended. Review by Anne Boling for Readers' Favorite The Mind Man is a rather dark tale that will appeal to fans of horror and paranormal genres. The characters show great depth and are very realistic with traits of egocentricity, insatiability, desire and adoration. PDRichmond cleverly teases readers to turn pages by ending each chapter with a cliff-hanger. As if that is enough the author includes twists and turns that kept me up all night reading. The ending is superb. I look forward to more books by PDRichmond.Review by Mac Robinson for LatteLifeThe Mind Man marks the arrival of an exciting new voice in thriller writing, an intelligent and compelling supernatural thriller that deserves to be called a page-turner.Richmond's prose is well paced and easy to read and he has a skilful way with dialogue. The globetrotting nature of the story is engaging and relevant and helps to intensify suspense and intrigue. In Adam, Richmond has created a complex and worryingly relatable villain which helps to elevate The Mind Man above more run of the mill thrillers. Richmond succeeds in juggling several plot lines and character arcs while never taking away from the underlying thread of mystery, and he manages to tie them together with an intelligent and satisfying conclusion.", "related": ["B00CV9I2J4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.9286, "rating_total": 55.0}

She believes above all in being different.  Consequently, this is her first published book.

When Laura is shot dead in an ambush aimed at Ireland's antidrug-crusading justice minister, Harry Power, Scott enlists the help of his Irish cop brother-in-law, Mark Higgins, to find and kill the mastermind behind the attack. Ireland's senior police officer, Commissioner Peter Cunningham, and Power agree to a secret plan whereby Scott uses his medical skills to extort information from drug dealers he and Higgins kidnap in their effort to track down the villain.

Michael also wrote on issues concerning the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and was an advocate for the protection of ancient Native American burials and cultural sites.

The Carnival of Souls is the epicenter of The City, inhabited by daimons. There has been enmity between daimons and witches for centuries, and most of the witches have been banished to the human world, where they live undetected. The City has a rigid caste system in which one's fate is determined by birth. Once every generation, Marchosias, the leader of the daimon ruling caste, holds a competition open to all of the castes, in which contestants fight to the death, with the final winner allowed entry to the ruling caste. Aya has rebelled against social norms by being the first ruling-caste girl to enter the competition, instead of marrying and breeding as is expected of her. In contrast, Kaleb, born into the lowest rung of the daimon social ladder, fights to escape the constraints imposed upon his caste. Mallory, the daughter of Marchosias, was taken from The City as an infant and raised among witches in the human world. She believes herself to be human and has been taught to hate daimons. The destinies of Mallory, Kaleb, and Aya are intertwined, and each one will play pivotal roles in the power struggle between daimons and witches. Marr's world-building is complex and masterful, and through skillful plotting, she builds intrigue and suspense, with plenty of romance as well. Her fans, as well as readers of Laini Taylor's Daughter of Smoke and Bone (Little, Brown, 2011), will devour this, and will eagerly await the next installment.-Francesca Burgess, Brooklyn Public Library, NYα(c) Copyright 2011.

Treatise by Friedrich Nietzsche, written in four parts and published in German between 1883 and 1885 as Also sprach Zarathustra. The work is incomplete, but it is the first thorough statement of Nietzsche's mature philosophy and the masterpiece of his career. It received little attention during his lifetime but its influence since his death has been considerable, in the arts as well as philosophy. Written in the form of a prose narrative, Thus Spake Zarathustra offers the philosophy of its author through the voice of Zarathustra (based on the Persian prophet Zoroaster) who, after years of meditation, has come down from a mountain to offer his wisdom to the world. It is this work in which Nietzsche made his famous (and much misconstrued) statement that \"God is dead\" and in which he presented some of the most influential and well-known (and likewise misunderstood) ideas of his philosophy, including those of the Ubermensch (\"overman\" or \"superman\") and the \"will to power.\" Though this is essentially a work of philosophy, it is also a masterpiece of literature. The book is a combination of prose and poetry, including epigrams, dithyrambs, and parodies as well as sections of pure poetry. --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1849 he was appointed professor of aesthetics at the academy of Geneva, and in 1854 became professor of moral philosophy. These appointments, conferred by the democratic party, deprived him of the support of the aristocratic party, which comprised nearly all the culture of the city.   This isolation inspired the one book by which Amiel is still known, the Journal Intime (\"Private Journal\"), which, published after his death, obtained a European reputation.

Attridge, Yale Divinity School\"The question of 'killing' has been a contested and debated issue from the earliest years of the church's history. May Christians serve in the military? Is abortion ever justifiable? What of the question of capital punishment? Ron Sider has produced an invaluable handbook of primary source material from an ancient Christian perspective that can serve the entire church well as we continue to face these thorny and often heartrending questions in a modern context.\"--Christopher A. Hall, Eastern University\"In recent years some have argued that the church of the first three centuries might have been somewhat ambivalent in its opposition to war and killing. Ron Sider's excellent and comprehensive sourcebook shows once again that, even though the practices of individual Christians might have deviated at times from what Christians are called to be and do, the uniform voice of the church before its rise to political power was one of unconditional rejection of war and killing in all its pluriformity.\"--George Kalantzis, The Wheaton Center for Early Christian Studies; author,Caesar and the Lamb: Early Christian Attitudes to War and Military Service\"In this very important work, Ron Sider returns to his roots as a church historian to offer an exceedingly careful, measured study of the literary evidence left by the early church on the morality of killing.

His father was Walter Nordhoff, a wealthy businessman and author of The Journey of the Flame penned under the name Antonio de Fierro Blanco. His mother, Sarah Cope Whitall, was of Pennsylvania Quaker stock. Nordhoff's parents returned to the United States with him in 1889, living first in Pennsylvania, then Rhode Island, and finally settling in California by 1898. Charles Bernard Nordhoff's grandfather was Charles Nordhoff, a journalist and author of non-fiction books. Nordhoff himself showed an early interest in writing. His first published work was an article in an ornithological journal, written in 1902 when he was just fifteen. At seventeen, he entered Stanford University, but transferred after one year to Harvard. After graduation in 1909, Nordhoff worked for his father's businesses, first spending two years in Mexico managing a sugar plantation, then four years as an executive of a tile and brick company in Redlands, California. He quit in 1916, signed up with the Ambulance Corps, and traveled to France. There he joined other American expatriates as a pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille. He finished World War I as a lieutenant in the US Army Air Service. Hall was born in Colfax, Iowa, where he attended the local schools. Hall graduated from Grinnell College in 1910 and became a social worker in Boston, Massachusetts, while trying to establish himself as a writer and studying for a Master's degree from Harvard University. Hall was on vacation in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1914, when World War I began. Posing as a Canadian, he enlisted in the British Army, serving in the Royal Fusiliers as a machine gunner during the Battle of Loos. He was discharged after his true nationality was discovered, and he returned to the United States and wrote his first book, Kitchener's Mob (1916), recounting his wartime experiences.", "related": ["B00CFW50MY"], "rank": 1732368, "title": "Mutiny on the Bounty (with panel zoom)", "author": "Charles Nordhoff", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Don't envy her living in beautiful Hawaii - since there are 12 books planned for the series, she will be locked away in her office writing and editing and not at the beach (hence no starfish characters!).  Her funny articles on family and parenting have appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer, VIV Magazine, Todays Parents, Working Mothers.com, Sheville, NYMetroParent and others.

I liked that it's a story in a story-a story about a family telling a story about their dogs. And I love dogs! I can't wait to read it again. I loved it, loved it, loved it! Woof, woof, woof!\"-Jasmine, Rowe, Age 8, Grade 3\"Meet the Tanners is a great, heart-warming book that immediately draws you into the Tanner family and their love, caring, and loyalty for their dogs.

Meet the Tanners should be on every family's must-read list.\"-Jack Olwell, 2009 Farmington Schools Teacher of the Year\"Reading Debra Tracy's chronicle was great fun, proving that adults will enjoy reading it as much as the kids it was written for.\"-Patty Paige, Sheltie Breeder, catawayshelties.com\"Meet the Tanners is a must-read for anyone wanting a new puppy in their lives.\" --Jane Hammett-Bright, Sheltie Breeder, 2010 Survivor Fan Favorite Winner, shadowhillshelties.comMeet the Tanners is a must read for anyone wanting a new puppy in their lives. The book explains the trials and tribulations of a small breeder of Shetland Sheepdogs. It shows how difficult it is to part with puppies, screen prospective buyers, and how emotionally attached to our dogs we get, especially when children are involved with raising them. The Tanner shelties are an important part of their everyday lives and everyone in the family plays an important part in the lives of the dogs. The Tanner s love for the breed shines throughout the book.  If you are considering buying a dog for a companion, I d suggest you read this book. --Jane Hammett-Bright, Sheltie Breeder, 2010 Survivor Fan Favorite Winner (shadowhillshelties.com)The reader is in for a treat in Meet the Tanners. Debra Tracy takes us along on the adventures and misadventures of the Tanner family and their beloved purebred Shetland Sheepdogs (shelties). We are drawn at times breathlessly into tales of loss and restoration, love and healing, even mystery and intrigue as Hannah and Curtis Tanner and their three children cares for and places a litter of puppies. Their devotion to their pups rivals their love for each other and hearkens back to simpler times. This is a fun book that underscores the life changing impact of such time-honored values as honesty, loyalty, and mercy. In an age where the line between right and wrong is often blurred and the strength of the family is waning, it is truly refreshing to join a family who exhibit the character traits that are sorely needed in society today. This book should be on every family s must read list.

The scope of this story spans a little less than a year but the bulk of the series actually starts in the upcoming sequel, about eleven years from when we first meet Aeron.My original plan was to create a prologue, introducing some of the information that you find inOnyx Plague, and then reference back to it further into the first book.  But rather than limiting such a rich introduction to Aeron and the Fairies, I changed my mind and decided to create a short story, in order to avoid describing so many significant past events during the main story.I've also taken a few liberties on some ideas that may be considered fantasy 'standards' so I hope you enjoy what I've done with them.", "related": ["B008N2KYP8"], "rank": 2901200, "title": "Onyx Plague (The Dragon Seed Legacy Book 1) eBook", "author": "T.

I suppose my love for this genre goes back to my maternal grandmother and an elderly neighbor and all the stories they loved to tell of gruesome murders, including those of Frankie and Johnny and Tom Dooley. However, I allowed myself to be sidetracked when I became fascinated with the age-old traditional lore that Abraham Lincoln was actually born in North Carolina. The result was a novel, Into The Twilight: The True Origins of Abe Lincoln. By the time I had learned the ins and outs of the e-book world and was ready to publish the Lincoln book, I had completed a rough draft of Blind Malice, the first in my Rachel Myers series which is set in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina in the present day. Since 2009 when the Lincoln book went live, I have published 11 books in the Myers series and have begun a new series with Ellis Crawford, a young man fresh out of the Marines, who takes a job as police chief in a small town in eastern North Carolina. This series begins in the late 1970's. There are 4 volumes to date in the Crawford series with more to come.", "related": ["B004BA5212"], "rank": 3048339, "title": "Christmas Trio: Two Short Stories and a Memory", "author": "Annis Ward Jackson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many new ghost hunting teams were encountering things like shadow people and demons (or at least malicious entities), but teams didn't knowwhatthey were dealing with, or what precautions to take.So, I dashed through a summary of what's ghostly and what isn't, and where the lines blur between labels we use for phenomena.In the two years after my book was first published, paranormal research grew by leaps and bounds. We learned alotmore about other kinds of entities, and some of them -- especially shadow people -- seemed to show up in larger numbers, as well.In July 2014, I revised, updated, and re-releasedGhosts - What They Are and What They Aren't.  This edition is better organized than the original, and it contains a lot more information, including specific examples of different kinds of phenomena.We're still guessing. The labels we use -- from \"ghosts\" to \"poltergeists\" and from \"shadow people\" to \"demons\" -- are stillcategories of phenomena.  These entities can do different things and react in different ways. It's important to know that, and recognize warning signs.If you're a ghost hunter, this book can help you understand whatelsemight be at a \"haunted\" site, and whether or not it might be dangerous.", "related": ["B007JD3LUM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In her quirky British family, her loving parents are absent most of the time and struggling with their own grief; her younger siblings, Twig and Jasmine, are adamant about their interests and wishes; and her older sister, Flora, is trying hard to be sophisticated and rise above the family chaos. Twelve-year-old Blue is obsessed with recording her life; and her narration is a mix of her diary entries and screenplay transcripts from her videos. Reminiscent of Hilary McKay's \"Casson Family\" series (S & S), this title features an unusual live-in babysitter, a no-nonsense grandmother, and assorted neighbors and school friends who contribute to the idiosyncratic events that the protagonist relates. Blue's pain at the loss of her sister is vivid and heart-wrenching, but never dire. Emotions both drive the plot and provide the humor. Blue has a crush on a neighborhood boy, who in turn is entranced with Flora. While the story is not particularly unique, it contains refreshingly entertaining characters who are sympathetic without being melodramatic.

Writers and readers agree that they\nunderstand the messages, the ethos, and the sheer entertainment value inherent\nin romances, and the two essays I wrote for DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMAN\nare my attempt to explain the nature and the appeal of these books to the\nfemale reader. I can testify that these stories have an enduring allure because\nI am currently selling many of my earliest titles, some of them thirty years\nold, on the internet. They are as popular now as when I first wrote them\n(during my childhood, of course). Today they are reaching a new generation of\nreaders electronically without the benefit of bookstores (and reminding some of\nmy long time, faithful readers that I am still kicking and still writing after\na long hiatus). Early in my career, Jayne\nAnn Krentz (aka Amanda Quick) and I shared an editor at Harlequin, Patricia\nSmith. Pat asked me, along with eighteen other prominent romance authors\nincluding Sandra Brown, Diana Palmer, Elizabeth Lowell, Laura Kinsale and Mary\nJo Putney, to help her create an anthology of essays on the subject of\nromances. The collection was designed to give readers, critics and academics\nsome insights on the subject of why romance novels are so popular. This\ncollaborative effort produced DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMEN, edited by\nSmith and published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in1992, brought out\nin paperback by HarperMonogram in 1996. This collection of essays extols the\nbenefits of reading and writing romances and explores why romance novels are so\npopular yet misunderstood by critics (and often the general public). I wrote\ntwo of the essays included in the collection, now available on Amazon, and they\nare described below. In \"Loved I Not Honor More:\nThe Virginal Heroine in Romance,\" I explore the undeniable appeal of the\nheroine who has her first sexual experience with the hero of the story. I\ndescribe this appeal as undeniable because I receive the letters from and talk\nwith the fans who read these stories, and they all share an enthusiasm for the\ntale which describes the inexperienced young lady who is initiated by the tough\nyet tender hero who simply can't resist her. Lots of other stories have their\nplace in popular fiction too, but this one seems to endure endless variations\nand remain viable as long as certain basic criteria are met: she must be a\nnewbie and he must love her as well as desire her. That said, everything else\nis up for grabs (so to speak). My essay explores why these elements are so\nnecessary and so enduringly popular. In \"Mad, Bad, and Dangerous\nto Know,\" I look into the basic fantasy which sustains all romances, the idea\nthat the supposedly weaker woman actually wins the battle of the sexes within\nthe confines of a romance book because at its end she brings the macho,\ndominant hero to heel. As I say in the essay, \"the hero may...give the heroine a\nterrible time...but in the end he capitulates because he simply must have her.\" I\nnever tire of reading this scenario, and my fans don't either. The role\nreversal is delightful and seeing the toughest hero melt in the warmth of his\nlady's regard is emotionally satisfying and socially uplifting. We liked it\nthen, we like it now, and we will always like it.      Publishers Weekly said\nabout DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMEN on its publication in 1992: \"In 22\nessays, romance novelists address why romances are popular. These authors are\nconvincing when they simply write what they think, as when Sandra Brown flatly\nasserts that romances 'are fun--fun to write, fun to read, fun to dissect and\ndiscuss.'\"  This assertion is still true. The stories remain fun first of\nall, but the explanations provided by the authors in the collection might\nclarify for the reader exactly why these books are so enjoyable, and why they\nendure. I recommend this collection and hope you like it.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 51.0}

Immediately after his conversion as a boy, he had a concern for the salvation of others and won people to Christ, including his mother. He became a plumber by trade, yet he continued to devote himself to winning many people to Christ on an individual basis. In 1882, he married Polly Featherstone, a vivacious young woman who loved God and had a gift of preaching and evangelism. It was she who taught him to read and who became his closest confidant and strongest supporter. They both had compassion for the poor and needy in their community, and they opened a mission, at which Polly preached. Significantly, people were miraculously healed when Wigglesworth prayed for them.In 1907, Wigglesworth's circumstances changed dramatically when, at the age of forty–eight, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit. Suddenly, he had a new power that enabled him to preach, and even his wife was amazed at the transformation. This was the beginning of what became a worldwide evangelistic and healing ministry that reached thousands. He eventually ministered in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and all over Europe. His ministry extended to the time of his death in 1947.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Education, employment, and an overseas war kept the Kirschbaum family on the move for the next ten years, living in Nebraska, Iowa, Nevada, and Florida before settling in Massachusetts. A basic ineptitude at anything not related to reading and writing his native language led to a B.A. in English Literature from Brandeis University and a short-lived career as a technical writer. In 1991, he started 3 Trolls Games & Puzzles – a traditional board game and puzzle store in Chelmsford, MA – with his family and has been running it ever since. In 2011 he collaborated with a group of friends and family to produce Verdigris, an interactive novel for the iPhone and iPad; his first traditional novel, Monday and the Murdered Man, followed shortly thereafter. Monday and the Counterfeit Corpse is his second and he is currently working on the next Monday adventure, another interactive novel, and various live action role playing games.", "related": [], "rank": 2524546, "title": "Monday and the Counterfeit Corpse (5th World Book 2)", "author": "Andrew Kirschbaum", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anyone who is religious, particularly Catholic WILL be offended... I don't imagine that she'll be invited to Rome to kiss the Pope's ring (pun intended) in a big hurry! However, the ebook is a clever parody of Catholic rites,it is sexy and fun. But after a while the action becomes repetitive and mechanical. The young priest is very generous with his favours, and serves all and sundry (a commendable ecumenical attitude!).The sad truth is that some of these activities have occurred in real life, and in a non consenual fashion- something that the Vatican needs to come to terms with...So this ebook can be seen as entertainment on one level, but a serious attack on the Church as well... .

Although a lot of his physical ailments were rehabilitated rather quickly, considering the circumstances, he still to this day suffers from minor balance and memory issues, as well as migraine headaches. It is also true that he went through a hard time, psychologically, due to the fact that he had become a totally different person and he was not sure if he liked him very much.Well, with the wind at his back, his writings providing an outlet, conversations with many good people, a positive attitude and desire, not to mention a strong family and a strong faith in God, Hunt will become, to the best of his abilities, the person he wants to be.Thank you.

He wanted to ensure plenty of action and interesting characters to leave the reader thrilled with the unlimited possibilities of a fantasy world. Carey enjoys the country lifestyle and enjoys fishing and hunting. It is a means of leaving the civilized world behind to breathe in the freshness of the country air.

Slavicek clearly explains this complex and confusing time for readers with little to no background in modern Chinese history, covering the social, economic, and political aspects of the era. The book is at its best when explaining Mao's political maneuvering. Numerous pull-out boxes provide context about and excerpts from primary sources. The final chapter offers a short overview of post-Mao China, explaining the country's economic growth and continued political oppression. In addition to the cited academic sources, the further-reading list gives many books and Web sites appropriate for students. With the number of memoirs coming out for middle grade and teen readers, such as Moying Li'sSnow Falling in Spring(Farrar, 2008), Da Chen'sChina's Son: Growing Up in the Cultural Revolution(Delacorte, 2001), and Ji-li Jiang'sRed Scarf Girl(HarperCollins, 1997), this welcome title provides much-needed context.—Jennifer Rothschild, Prince George's County Memorial Library System, Oxon Hill, MD(c) Copyright 2010.

Katchanovski (Univ. of Ottawa) updates the first edition, published just after the Orange Revolution, to include events from this period. This new edition expands articles on people, places, and events of post-1991 Ukraine. Aside from these much-needed updates, the original text by the highly qualified team of Zenon Kohut (Univ. of Alberta), Bohdan Nebesio (Brock Univ.), and Myroslav Yurkevich (Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press) is mostly intact. The 700-plus entries are brief, but provide basic definitions and indicate the subjects' relevance to Ukrainian history. The excellent supplemental material includes maps, a list of abbreviations, a detailed but succinct chronology, an extensive bibliography, and a series of appendixes on post-1991 Ukraine (new to this edition). Boldface type indicates that a concept is mentioned elsewhere in the text, but sparse cross-referencing may make finding some topics confusing. For example, some topics often referred to by their Ukrainian names—Holodomor,Batkyvshchina, OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists)—are listed only under English headings. This dictionary will prove useful to a wide range of scholars interested in eastern Europe, European history, and modern European politics. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates through researchers/faculty; general readers.(CHOICE)This is the 2d edition of this work on Ukrainian history in English. It has more than 725 entries that cover biographies, places, historical events, institutions, economics, and social and cultural aspects of Ukraine. The book has a list of acronyms and abbreviations, nine maps, a chronology, and an introduction that summarizes the history of Ukraine. Then it goes into the entries, which are in the traditional A-to-Z format. The entries vary in length. Cross-references are indicated by having the topic or term in bold print. The authors use the modified Library of Congress system to transliterate Ukrainian and other East Slavic words and names. The authors are associated with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (CIUS) at the University of Alberta. The book ends with an extensive bibliography that has its own introduction. The bibliography is subdivided into various subjects. Books, articles, and Internet sites are included. . . .This is a great one-volume reference on Ukrainian history that belongs in academic and larger public libraries with a Ukrainian or Eastern European reference section.(American Reference Books Annual)", "related": [], "rank": 4721489, "title": "Historical Dictionary of Ukraine (Historical Dictionaries of Europe) eBook", "author": "Ivan Katchanovski", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans.

He felt his life lacked joy and tired of the feeling of being in a shell, he began searching for ways to allow him to have the relationships and emotional depth he longed for. He devised his own method after receiving inspiration from an unusual, yet familiar source... After finding peace and joy in his life, Michael wanted to share with others that there is something better than simply accepting what modern medicine has to offer. His daily routine has allowed him to mend fences with his children and make peace with his past, leaving him to live his life as he chooses, but with more self-control and self-esteem than ever before.

Robert Garvey has performed a considerable service in offering this timely critique of our field. We would all benefit from reading itProfessor David A. LaneProfessional Development Foundation and Middlesex University, UKGarvey is a curious and impassioned thinker, committed to coaching and mentoring as emancipatory endeavors. Not afraid to be controversial in the cause of challenging accepted practices and beliefs, he raises timely questions in a feisty and informed way. In a field too often dominated by the search for competitive advantage, Garvey champions holistic qualitative research and the building of trust through opennessLeni WildflowerDirector, Coaching Innovations, Fielding Graduate University, USACoaching and mentoring challenging assumptions and question patterns of thinking. In this book, Bob Garvey questions some of our basic assumptions about the nature and practice of coaching and mentoring. If pat definitions and certainty are what you need, this book will give you nightmares. But if you aspire to be a truly great coach/ mentor, it will raise valuable questions about how you define your practiceDavid ClutterbuckVisiting Professor,  Sheffield Hallam University and Oxford Brookes University, UK, Ambassador for the European Mentoring and Coaching CouncilIn a world where coaching and mentoring are becoming increasingly popular, Robert Garvey provides a concise yet comprehensive critique of coaching and mentoring. He is bold in his challenges and constructive in his arguments and reading this book will leave those passionate about coaching and mentoring with new ideas, frameworks and arguments to move forward.  He creates a discourse of coaching and mentoring for all to consider and challenges us to rethink our focus on learning, competitiveness, psychology, and competency. It is a great resource and an exceptional contribution to the field. Well doneProfessor Richard K. LadyshewskyCurtin Graduate School of Business, Curtin University, Perth, Western AustraliaThis book is an engaging and critical review, packed with thought-provoking analysis based on the author's wide-ranging experience. An excellent contribution to the debate on the state of coaching and mentoring todayIan WycherleyProgramme Director: MA Coaching and Mentoring Practice, Business School, Oxford Brookes University, Wheatley, UK'My own conclusion is that this book provides useful information and highlights significant aspects for consideration. I had anticipated, from the title and the cover, which looks rather like an old-fashioned, home-made book of recipes (fake handwriting font and fake coffee cup stains on it) more of a practical, how-to-do-it book. It is certainly not that. It will, however, appeal to those with an academic interest in coaching or mentoring and to anyone considering a research study (about anything, as the ideas can be applied to much more than coaching and mentoring)' (Julie Hay)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Very much a strong part of the local community, she enjoys sharing her knowledge to help others.    Proud mother to two adult daughters and a son currently studying his PhD, Helen decided to pen ’50 Pearls of Wisdom’ thanks to her own 'mother of the bride' experiences. What should have been a happy occasion turned into months of frustration. She simply didn’t know what was expected of her. After researching online, she found she certainly wasn’t alone. What should you wear? How should you deal with a daughter who turns into bridezilla? How do you handle meeting the in-laws? All of these were burning questions in Helen's mind.  50 Pearls of Wisdom was created to help women everywhere understand what is expected of them on their daughter’s special day.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I, Charles, besides being a writer, am a martial artist who was born and reared in sunny Southern California. Yes, I am a rare native who was actually born here.  See, we do exist. Growing up in Washington, D.C., I, D. W., know about cold. I finally made it west to Los Angeles where I have lived for the past ??? years. So now, I know about sunny and warm. We both agree … sunny is better. Backgrounds: As an avid lifelong reader, Charles has always dreamed of creating a world into which he could immerse himself and feel safe. Writing has given him an outlet that allows for expression behind the shield of different characters and places. Stories of daring adventures and faraway places helped D.W. to avoid the pitfalls of the streets, inspiring him to dream bigger and reach farther. Those stories still inspire him today. In joining forces, we have found the creative partnership and motivation to see our writing dreams manifest into reality. We hope you enjoy the world we’ve created. The Partnership: D.W. Jones and I teamed up almost a decade ago.  In that time, we have written a variety of works. Here are a few: Feature length screenplays Television pilots Web series scripts Dozens of spec television commercials and industrials and now a full-length novel.", "related": ["B00KET4TR2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through depiction of the changing stances and shifting moral interpretations of different churches and groups, she reveals that the harsh moment in which we find ourselves stuck is not inevitable, and that the contest is fundamentally a political one.”-Wendy Chavkin MD, MPH, Professor of Clinical Population and Family Health and Obstetrics-Gynecology; Heilbrunn Dept of Population and Family Health and Dept Obstetrics-Gynecology; Mailman School of Public Health and College of Physicians and Surgeons; Columbia University“Pitch perfect! Roye tells it all and tell is it extremely well. Grounded in her own experience as a nurse, hard data and her skills as a researcher this short easy-to-read book documents the horrific consequences of denying women the right to contraception, abortion and control over their own bodies. Roye moves beyond descriptions to reveal how women’s health was sacrificed to the interests of power, politics and professional interests.A Woman’s Right to Knowis a must read for anyone interested in preventing maternal deaths and child abuse, reducing health care costs and otherwise ending the war on women’s reproductive rights.”-Mimi Abramovitz, Bertha Capen Reynolds Professor of Social Policy, Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College and The Graduate Center, CUNY“Drawing on her extensive clinical experience as a nurse and educator, Professor Carol Roye makes an impassioned case for the benefits of safe and accessible contraception and abortion to American women and their families. Drawing on the long and often tortured political history of this issue, she also reminds us that advancing reproductive health and rights is not just a moral obligation to protect women rights but also a fundamental tool to fight poverty and promote overall well-being.”-Ellen Cheslerauthor ofWoman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America“How did we get to a place where even family planning is a controversial issue, despite the indisputable evidence showing that it saves and improves the quality of lives of women and children?A Woman’s Right to Knowlays out this evidence and an explanation of why women’s rights to abortion and family planning are under siege. As a researcher and women’s health nurse practitioner, Dr. Roye has written a compelling story of the history of the politicization of reproductive rights for women in the U.S. that is filled with surprises and is a must-read for anyone who cares about the lives of women and children.”-Diana Mason, President of the American Academy of Nursing“Did you know that early feminists opposed abortion? Or that doctors were more likely to perform the procedure on unmarried women? Can you remember when most of the abortion debates were between doctors, over matters of technique? This book is bound to deepen your understanding of the abortion wars and humanize an issue surrounded by partisan fury.”--Corinna Barnard, Editor,Women’s eNews“Carol Roye has provided critical documentation and analysis of the history and current realities and barriers to reproductive health. Interweaving her own complex experience of compassionate care, compelling case illuminations of how forces outside of the lives and bodies of real girls and women constrain choice, and a comprehensive retelling of what was and what is at stake in reproductive justice, this book is a must read for all of us.”-Deborah Tolman, EdD, Professor of Social Welfare and Psychology, Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College“A Women&srquo;s Right to Know provides a comprehensive picture of the politics behind the increasing number of assaults on reproductive freedom. Roye’s book not only shines a light on the untold story of women’s health, but shows us a way forward on steps we can take to reclaim it.”---Vicki Breitbart, EdD,LCSW, Director, Health Advocacy, Graduate Studies at Sarah Lawrence College, Professor, Perspectives on Reproductive Health at New York University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fionn, himself, only appears as a newborn baby but his absence is more than made up for by the presence of two very strong female characters (the woman warrior Liath Luachra and the druidess Bodhmhall) and the hilariously complex warrior, Fiacail mac Codhna.The pace is set early on when Fionn's pregnant Muirne Muncháem is travelling to the Rath Bladhma of the title and has to defend herself against a wolf attack. After that the action and the tension never really stops as that settlement uses every trick at its disposal to defend itself against a scary cannibal horde and a kind of mind-controlling druid, both of whom are trying to get their hands on the baby.I really loved the complex character of Liath Luachra and the relationship she has with Bodhmhall. This is touching and real but, at the same time, restrained and doesn't detract from the action and the various twists and turns. If you're looking for a book full of action but with realistic characters, this is highly recommended.(Goodreads Reviewer Ann O'Connor)", "related": ["B00JUQJS58"], "rank": 354895, "title": "Fionn", "author": "Brian O'Sullivan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Infiltrating the ranks of nurses, residents and surgeons, and witnessing the often heroic efforts of parents and offspring in coping with illness, the author demonstrates that treatment of the young, and the web of professional and personal relationships surrounding it, is best fostered in institutions dedicated solely to the cause of children. Employing a journalist's \"fly on the wall\" strengths of observation, rendering insights with novelistic verve, Gutkind recounts hospital procedures--from organ transplants to therapy for child abuse cases--and chronicles a procession of tragedies and triumphs. The author's two years at the facility at One Children's Place yields a striking portrait.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I must say though, like many of you might already know, it often is challenging in this world that we live in. Throughout the years I have come to realize the only thing that I can truly be in control of is me. Or shall I say my actions and how I show up in the world. For me it is all about taking responsibility for how I act, how I treat myself and how I treat others. Wheewwwww, and I won't lie, sometimes it takes everything I have to make a decision to act appropriately. When I do, things always seem to turn out as they should. Funny how that works.!.! ;-) So, here I am publishing information to the world for consumption. I hope what ever words your read of mine and in what ever format you choose to read them in, that they make a difference in your life. No matter how small or large that difference maybe, it will tell me (in a cosmic kind of way) that I have done my job......

She refers to them as \"smart fluff\"--while there is some dark fare, you won't find the bone-deep angst often associated with slave fiction. Her contemporary stories explore power exchange in a consensual setting. Her fantasy stories explore power exchange that is often non-consensual, in settings where legal, non-racial slavery exists side by side with political struggles for abolition.She welcomes feedback on any or all of her books at miri.thompson18@gmail.com.
