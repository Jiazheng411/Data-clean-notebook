Ana, a virginal odalisque, is trapped in the idle harem of Boaz, the chaste, adolescent Zar of Percheron. Nearly every man who sees Ana desires and adores her, not only the Zar but also exiled warrior Lazar and the goddess-touched, shape-shifting dwarf, Pez. However, Herezah, the Zar's mother, sees Ana as a dangerous threat to her supremacy in the harem, and she concocts a plan with chief eunuch Salmeo to bring about Ana's humiliation and demise. A new setting eventually blows a fresh desert breeze through the stifling atmosphere, but the hundreds of pages spent building up to Ana's escape attempt, including a disturbing scene of sexual torture at Salmeo's hands, will have the reader sharing Ana's longing to be anywhere other than the Zar's palace.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With a childhood marred by the deaths of her mother and sister, these early lessons made this \"stubborn\" woman determined to get an education at a time when women were not encouraged to attend university—let alone to study science. Ogilvie reveals a deeper story behind Marie's romantic and professional relationship with Pierre Curie, a kindred soul who, like Marie, believed that \"salvation lay in science and religion.\" A shy, private woman, she couldn't understand the publicity over her later later with physicist Paul Langevin, years after Pierre died in a traffic accident. Even as her health faded, a terrible side effect of handling radioactive materials for years, she continued to work hard.

I fell in love with Micah's effervescent, funny, and determined personality from the very start. He is determined to have his way, even when the obstacles are his two very strong mates. Micah never cared about them being werewolves, where it would send most people into hysterics. The growing relationships between Micah, Thomas and Caleb are full of trials and the one voice of reason is the smallest one of all, Micah. The other twists and turns of this story keep the reader spellbound until the very end. This is the first book by Ms. Glenn that I have read and it certainly won't be the last.

She tells her vision to Merry, who later witnesses a cheerleader injured and hospitalized. The shoes had been sabotaged. As Merry tries to find the culprit, Mally tries to figure out who or what the white lion is. She is also worried about her friend Eden, a junior who is secretly seeing a college guy. Eden, a Cree, invites Mally to a tribal powwow, where she meets Eden's younger brother, who is visiting from prep school. She is instantly attracted to Cooper, who explains about the significance of the white lion in his tribe. Can Mally help Eden make the right choice about her relationship? Can Merry find the culprit before the next cheerleading tryouts?

Despite her lack of a proper chaperone, Meg is determined to search for her twin sister, Gabriella, who vanished after she left to meet and marry her betrothed. When Meg and her younger sister, Elizabeth, come across a wounded, handsome young knight lying in the abbey's squash patch, Meg hastens to tend to the gash on his head, hoping that he'll agree to act as her chaperone when he wakes. To her disappointment, Gresham remembers little more than his name, but he eventually agrees to accompany her on her mission. Along the way, the two evade the plague, fight off a band of hungry wolves, clash with one of Gresham's old enemies and fall in love, although Gresham may have a wife whom he can't remember. Meg is an admirable heroine, but it's Gresham who blossoms here as he learns many troubling details about the man he was and strives to begin his life anew. Miller's consistent excellence and genre-jumping habits have earned her a large, loyal readership; her fans will embrace this dynamic entry.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The portrait it paints is fully adequate in detail and balance, including as it does such aspects as how Earhart's father's alcoholism affected--nearly ruined--the family and affected her relations with the rest of them. Always intellectually alive and curious, Earhart didn't at first think of flying in connection with the status of women--it was just fun. She quickly came to realize, however, what larger goals might be served by her flying, and she never lost sight of them thereafter, right up to her disappearance in 1937. Van Pelt covers a good many of Earhart's achievements that all but the largest biographies leave out, and she treats Earhart's husband, George Putnam, fairly (he was something of a wheeler-dealer but honored a prenuptial agreement nearly two generations ahead of the time for that kind of thing). Everybody ought to have basic knowledge of Earhart; this is a good place to acquire it.Roland GreenCopyright © American Library Association.

One of his father's black farmhands lends his expertise as the two take to the open road. The driving lesson soon turns into an adventure neither had bargained for and Justin learns more than just how to drive his father's truck. Through humor, mishap and racial prejudice, along with the guidance of a loving God and the driven faith of Able Johnson, young Justin Cane soon learns the meaning of integrity and righteousness through the eyes of a black man. Humorous, tense, action filled with distinct southern dialogue, Cane and Able is a perfect fit for the troubled era in which it is set and lends a wonderful insight into the life experience of a family destined to be taken on the journey of a lifetime. Stephen Cheek has a talent for storytelling. A great read overall. --Reviewed by Cindy Bauer Writer/Editor/Reviewer/InterviewerThe urge to embrace the road inevitably trumps nervousness and fear. Cane and Able follows young Justin Cane as he tries to gain his wheels in the late 1950s. His teacher is one of his father's farmhands, and through their travels, Justin Cane learns more than just how to maneuver a vehicle; he learns about life and the harsh side of reality. Cane and Able is a read that will leave readers thinking. Recommended for library distribution. --Midwest Book Review (Oregon, WI USAI'm still amazed at how well he formed not only the characters themselves, but the situations they were in, the conversations, the thoughts, everything. I'm excited to read another book in the future and I would love to see another book with these same characters- maybe a prequel or sequel Mr. Cheek? :) The book follows Justin and Able, the two main characters. Justin is Mr Canes young son and Able is a trusted farmhand. Their relationship is simple and complex at the same time and you feel like you're riding right along with them for the ride when you read their talks with each other. I felt so many emotions, strong emotions, bubbling up while reading, everything from wanting to just hug Able for being the kind of man he is to wanting to hurt Big Doug for the kind of man he is. It's not just the main characters that get the emotions and thoughts going either- it's all the characters- every single one. --Eva Ledger (Middletown, DE) Goodreads Reviewer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After witnessing how much more quickly Fine advanced in his career—despite their near-identical education and work performance—and observing the difficulties that their daughter was facing in her job search, the couple took a long look at the factors holding women down. The book breaks down the corporate culture mantras (e.g., find mentors, be prudent in challenging the power structure) and the hidden impediments they pose for women. Despite major gains for women elsewhere in society, little has changed for women in corporate America; sexism is insidious rather than overt, and in dealing with men in the workplace, women are still presented with two options: fight them or become them. But becoming them can backfire, as Cronin and Fine demonstrate through stories of women struggling to break into corporate culture and bond with co-workers. This intelligent and substantive work is a must-read for all businesspeople—and will make an excellent graduation gift for young women entering the workforce.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From early discussions of a document authorizing travel to “civilized states,” along with the politics of determining who was civilized and who wasn’t, he points out the many ways in which passport law has stepped ahead of national and personal identities. He recalls the early difficulty in translating Chinese names (dismissed as “ill adapted for pronouncing and writing by the majority of Americans” in 1917) and the problem of how to establish accurate physical descriptions of individuals in the era before photography. Robertson clearly relishes such side issues, veering with great aplomb into the history of birth certificates and the debate over why women would need passports since they always traveled with their husbands. Ultimately, the passport serves as an umbrella sheltering many aspects of the cultural past. Illustrated with numerous examples, Robertson’s history of the significance of one small document starts slowly but builds steam and expands into a broad and relevant chronicle. --Colleen Mondor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this memoir, he describes life growing up in the camp, focusing on both the daily life of Palestinians in the camp and on the politics of the refugees (Kanj himself became a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a time). He also includes a chapter discussing the 2007 destruction of the camp.Jamal Kanj’s story evokes all the emotions experienced through life’s trials, enhanced and exaggerated by it being experienced within a refugee camp that remained under continual stress from external forces. The book is well written and does not dwell on the deprivations, but instead emphasizes the successes of life within the camp, successes against many seemingly overwhelming odds. From that success, the success of survival and more, the Palestinian identity will remain strong within its own community. Children of Catastrophe helps explain that identity and brings it to life in a straight forward manner, for those beyond the borders of the community, to the larger community of global humanitarian awareness.The Israel and Palestine conflict has shattered countless lives. \"Children of Catastrophe: Journey from a Palestinian Refugee Camp to America\" is a memoir form Jamal Krayem Kanj, as he reflects on his own journey through the conflict, and how from a refugee camp struggling to survive he found his way to America and made his own way in life. A unique story with a powerful message, \"Children of Catastrophe\" is a moving and thoughtful read that would do well in any international memoir collection.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anand, author of2032As a person who is interested in historic\nhomes, renovation and city planning, I was particularly drawn in. But\nwhen the novel exploded into an action packed thriller, I was even\nfurther rewarded. The author really knows how to draw a character and\npaint a description. She writes with ease and humor and throws just a\nlittle bit of Christian ethic into the romance aspect of the book,\nstaying away from the urge to go sexy. The romance is sweet\nnever-the-less, and adds plenty of extra interest. Finally, as the story\n takes place in Portland, Oregon, I enjoyed it even more so, because,\nthough I'm not from Portland, I love the city, and enjoyed traveling the\n streets and visiting the neighborhoods and local spots by proxy.

Liz and her older brother are camping with their father when Liz encounters 91-year-old Sally Beck, whose face resembles a \"crumpled brown paper bag.\" Smarting from a fight with her brother, Liz grumbles that she sometimes wishes she were a boy. In the intriguing tale-within-a-tale that follows, the old woman explains that she ran away from home at the age of 12, dressed in her brother's clothes, and became an apprentice gardener at Carlton Hall, where she cared for the topiary garden. For years, Sally (known as Jack) kept her gender a secret-until accused of impregnating her employer's maid. Howker's writing is crisp and her imagery striking, but the book's themes (not to mention the text's tiny print) are too sophisticated for readers on the younger end of the suggested audience. Similarly, although Browne's detailed art is impeccably rendered-and contains some mysterious images-picture after picture of the topiary garden may become tiresome for children.

Then, at the age of twenty-three, having decided that the Catholic priesthood was the highest possible human attainment, he was accepted for training and began his studies (1955–61) at St John’s Seminary, near Guildford, Surrey, along with two of his three brothers. A period as a curate followed, after which he was drafted into the Army again, this time as a Chaplain. As a priest in service uniform for over eighteen years he spent time in Germany, Malaya and the UK.

It covers equipment, tackle, approaching the water, baitfishing, specific types of fish, tying flies, and more. Speaking directly to children, Amdahl passes on numerous bits of information and tips gleaned from his years of experience. On the sunfish's favorite food (the tomato worm) he suggests, \"If your parents have a garden with tomatoes in it, look on the leaves for green caterpillars with a circle marking on them and a stinger thing on one end. That is a tomato worm. They look kind of scary, but they have never hurt me.\" He reminds readers that it is not important to keep every fish they catch and when releasing them to be careful not to harm them. \"The fun of catching a fish is in the skill it took to accomplish, not in the meat or dead body of the fish.\" One chapter is missing in the table of contents, and there is no index. The black-and-white photos are dark and grainy. With full-page color diagrams and step-by-step photos and illustrations, Fiona Patchett's Starting Fishing (Usborne, 1999) and John Bailey's The Young Fishing Enthusiast (DK, 1999) are better sources for those new to the sport.Diane Olivo-Posner, Long Beach Public Library, CACopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He did not go unnoticed, selling 50,000 units in his first year and earning a spot on the Essence Magazine Bestsellers list.  Since Entangled, Elliott has published five titles of his own and two more on behalf of authors signed to Urban Lifestyle Press. For one book, The Ski Mask Way, Elliott was selected to co-author with hip-hop superstar 50 Cent. Along the way, he has continued to look for innovative ways to push his books to his fans while keeping down his overhead. Not wanting to keep such valuable experience to himself, Elliott did two things.  First, in 2010 he forged his vision of low-cost publishing by in 21 Black Street, an eBookstore to mirror a traditional African-American themed bookstore - except it could totally cuts out a publisher's printing costs.  Second, Elliott created the Well-Fed Black Writer, a blog for authors to find life-hacking tips for more efficient, effective self-publishing.

It’s just something that’s been in me for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I can recall my 6th grade teacher quieting the class to listen to him as he read only one person’s assignment out loud, mine. As a child I was totally humiliated, but now in retrospect I see that instance, and many others like it, as confirmation that I truly was born to be a writer. By the time I was in high school I was writing daily chapters of a risqué romance novel that were passed around class for all the girls to read, it was infectious and went on for months and months. Every day was a new chapter with an added twist designed to shock and awe my friends, and I didn’t disappoint. Here again, I never thought of myself as a writer back then, I was merely a kid having fun. It never occurred to me I would someday be authoring real books that would be published. I was just being myself and doing what came naturally to me. As I was growing up our family’s business was the local bookstore so I always had a ready supply of the classics available, of which I took advantage. My father was also a writer, so I credit him with instilling the predisposition to write into me. I am a supreme lover of books and literature… and words. Until now I have contented myself editing the works of other authors. This is my first attempt at publishing a story of my own.

I developed a short plot outline and some of the characters, then made up character sheets, which suggested other plot lines and characters.  Once I had the major plot details defined, I wrote a scene by scene breakdown and spent a lot of time making sure that the plot made sense and had no holes. When I was happy with this I wrote the first draft which came in at around 45,000 words. Then I had some real fun expanding everything, adding small references to favourite science fiction characters and moments and commenting on science, politics and human behaviour.  As I was trying to create a feeling of the early days of our manned space program and some of the conspiracy paranoia of the 50's and 60's combined with a late 90's based technology level, I deliberately used a '98 edition dictionary and a thesaurus from the early 60's. My hope is that this creates a slightly old school atmosphere.  Coming up with character and place names was great fun. It should be reasonably obvious to most readers how I did it. There are lots of small details which will reward careful reading and one of my aims was to create a book which encourages the reader to re-read it and get a different experience once they know what is actually going on and can 'spot the clues'.  There is potential for a sequel of sorts, but that is a long way down my list. The book I am working on now combines time travel, man made viruses and a study of a man's descent into madness.  As always, thank you for reading this far, and, if you do read my book, please add a review on Amazon and visit my website and Facebook page.", "related": ["B00FI23NDG"], "rank": 1371272, "title": "The Star Ring Conspiracy eBook", "author": "Mark Boxall", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In fact, I was the first Westerner to gain access\nto certain relevant materials in East Germany. I also conducted interviews with\nwell over 100 survivors of Nazi Germany. Some of those I interviewed turned into friends, and we\ncarried on unending dialogues about the subjects and themes described in this\nbook: the nature of evil, the insidious moral corruption that spreads like\ncancer even to healthy organs in a society ruled by criminals, the power of\nself-deception, the limits of conscience, God's role in human affairs, and much\nmore.  The stories told to me by the\nwitnesses of the period have been worked into the fabric of this novel, as have\ntheir understanding and explanations of the entire period, society and regime.\nSometimes those perceptions are contradictory. That is the nature of the human\nexperience. Among the survivors of the German Resistance whom I had the\nprivilege to later call friends were, first and foremost, Ludwig Freiherr von\nHammerstein, Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche, Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager,\nEva Olbricht, Friedrich Georgi, Marion Graefin Yorck von Wartenburg, and\nClarita von Trott zu Solz.  It was an\nhonor - which I have yet to earn - that these courageous, bright and\nwarm-hearted people welcomed me into their homes, shared their memories and\nfeelings with me, and encouraged me to persist in this difficult project. Obviously, there are millions of other witnesses whom I was\nnot able to interview. Every person who endured the National Socialist regime,\nwhether as an enthusiastic supporter or as an opponent, has a unique perspective\nand a personal story. This book cannot encompass all those stories, but it does\nattempt to provide a spectrum of experiences and attitudes.  Furthermore, as someone who lived for more\nthan 20 years in Berlin, embedded completely into the society both\nlinguistically and professionally, I am confident that the social and cultural\natmosphere portrayed in this novel is authentic.  Last but not least, the polaces described are\nplaces I personally visited.", "related": ["B005UGCZFC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Families zip through, stop at the occasional pull-out for a photo-op, then continue along their way. While most parks cater to motorists, one cannot experience their essence from the comfort of your driver's seat. You must walk among the trees and the mountains. Listen to wildlife all around you. Sit back, close your eyes and immerse yourself in nature. America's 58 national parks are irreplaceable treasures, yet they are our parks, preserved for our enjoyment, and if you want to experience them to their fullest you're going to need a good guide.That's where I come in. I admit my first trip to a national park was your typical affair. A group of friends drove to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We peered in, snapped a few photos, shrugged and returned to our rental car. Did we know that adventurous hikers were resting their tired legs at Phantom Ranch nearly 5,000 feet below at the canyon's floor? No. Did we know how to reach the North Rim? Probably not. The point is, we didn't know much about the Grand Canyon.I've come a long way since those first steps atop the South Rim. While researching this book I spent two full years exploring and photographing the parks, living almost exclusively in my tent. As I passed from park-to-park I learned that this was much more than an assignment; it became an awakening. It was a communion with life and land as I learned to immerse myself in nature.

I spent twenty years in Europe because of my father, who was with the U.S. Diplomatic Corps, and my mother who was an opera singer. I worked mainly as a simultaneous interpreter and translator as I am a linguist and speak several languages, five of which are fluent. Because of my exposure to people of different nations my writing includes many foreign settings and cultures. I am a proud mother of a gallant Marine who served in Iraq, and among the members of our household you will find Louie the cat, so named because of his clawing love of Louis XV and XVI furniture, and surely thinks he must have been a fearless Marine in one of his former lives. iTunes has ranked 'Peace of Music' #1 in their TOP BOOKS.

A native of Wilmington, Delaware, he spent the last year of his life in Florence, Italy. In 1894 he began teaching illustration at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now Drexel University), and after 1900 he founded his own school of art and illustration called the Howard Pyle School of Illustration Art. The term the Brandywine School was later applied to the illustration artists and Wyeth family artists of the Brandywine region by Pitz (later called the Brandywine School). Some of his more famous students were Olive Rush, N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Elenore Abbott, Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle, Allen Tupper True, and Jessie Willcox Smith. His 1883 classic The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood remains in print to this day, and his other books, frequently with medieval European settings, include a four-volume set on King Arthur that cemented his reputation. He wrote an original work, Otto of the Silver Hand, in 1888. He also illustrated historical and adventure stories for periodicals such as Harper's Weekly and St. Nicholas Magazine. His Men of Iron was made into a movie in 1954, The Black Shield of Falworth. Pyle travelled to Florence, Italy to study mural painting in 1910, and died there in 1911 of sudden kidney infection (Bright's Disease).", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 45.0}

Although he was born in Argentina, Duggan grew up in England, and was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. After Oxford, he travelled extensively through Greece and Turkey, visiting almost all the sites later mentioned in his books. In 1935 helped excavate Constantine's palace in Istanbul. Duggan came to writing fiction quite late in his life: his first novel about the First Crusade, Knight in Armour, was published in 1950, after which he published at least a book every year until his death in 1964. His fictional works were bestselling page-turners, but thoroughly grounded in meticulous research informed by Duggan's experience as an archaeologist and historian. Duggan has been favourably compared to Bernard Cornwell as well as being praised in his own right as 'an extremely gifted writer who can move into an unknown period and give it life and immediacy.'

I loved the fact that she could pack lovable (and some not so lovable) characters, intense romantic attraction, and a bit of suspense into the space of a tantalizing novella.

My own spirit responded to that poem's description of our daughter Cindy's arrival in heaven. That spiritual response has inspired my writings for more than twenty-five years. After having cancer and experiencing MariEl Healing through a wonderful woman of healing, Patrice Cheviot, I became a MariEl Healing practitioner. MariEl Healing emanates from Jesus flowing through Mary. The practitioner is a participant in the prayer process. Friends knew of my history and asked to personally experience this healing prayer. Twenty years later, I have prayed with hundreds of people who have cancer. Out of those prayer experiences, and based on a career of formulating and delivering executive development workshops, I created workshop experiences for people experiencing cancer. Recently, I have been delivering workshops for people who are searching for deeper peace and emotional freedom through their own relationship with God. Over the years, these workshops have been given to the American Cancer Society, conducted at churches, and at the Upper Room, a Catholic spiritual development center in Neptune, NJ. Before writing, a prayer asking for guidance helped me feel spiritually connected and attuned to persons whose stories are reflected in this book. These stories are about spiritual life based in Catholic/Christian beliefs and our increasingly graced relationship with God that springs from those beliefs.", "related": ["B00ASCEIQ2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The volume is published by the Justice 21 Committee of the SSSP, an endeavor that was inspired by Dr. Robert Perrucci in his 2000 SSSP Presidential Address, “Inventing Social Justice: SSSP and the 21st Century,” in which he reminded the SSSP membership of the need to engage in public discourse with those who might use our academic and practical knowledge in addressing social problems.i Not only did Dr. Perrucci’s speech mark the 50th Annual Meeting of the SSSP, it also helped set an agenda for our work moving into the 21st Century. From this inspiration a new committee was formed: the Justice 21 Committee, whose mission is to undertake the charge given by Dr. Perrucci to contribute to a public sociology of social problems. The members of the Justice 21 Committee are six academic sociologists (Glenn W. Muschert, Chair, Miami University; Kathleen Ferarro, Northern Arizona University; Brian V. Klocke, State University of New York, Plattsburgh; JoAnn Miller, Purdue University; Robert Perrucci, Purdue University; and Jon Shefner, University of Tennessee.) The contributors of the eleven chapters are sociologists working in the respective fields of expertise about which they are writing.  They range from seasoned academics who have been prominent members of the field for decades, to up-and-coming stars in the field. The contributors bring a wide variety of academic, activist, and policy expertise to the table. In this volume, they have communicated their ideas and recommendations in concrete and clear language accessible to all concerned citizens and students of social issues.

The anonymous Upanishads get their own entry, but generally, uppercase or boldface personal names introduce specific philosophical positions.

Pace, vocabulary, allusions, and complex ideas mark this as a volume for advanced students; the writing is neither clear nor lively enough to entice beginners. The absence of summaries or digests of each philosophy makes this volume most useful for those seeking the contributions of individual thinkers. The typeface is small and faint, and the index is eye-defyingly compressed.Eastern Religions(Oxford, 2005), edited by Michael D.

Trask for Readers' FavoriteReviewed on 04/30/2013Awarded 4 starsSo, you are an introvert. Isn't that the same as being shy,\nor socially anxious? Isn't it a handicap in a society that values extroversion?\nNo way, says Amber Keyes in her new book \"The Advantage of Being an\nIntrovert in an Extrovert World\". Instead, Keyes looks at the positive\naspects of being an introvert. Introversion is a popular book topic lately,\nthough many titles tend to be heavy on research and light on practical advice.\nKeyes supplies the advice. Her concise e-book may not cover the history of\npsychology at great length, but it is clearly intended as more of a how-to manual.I saw in Keyes' personal stories how being an\nintrovert has affected her life, and how she came to celebrate the trait rather\nthan hide it. I smiled in recognition when she addressed issues near and dear\nto an introvert's heart, like how to survive networking events, and the dreaded\n\"small talk\" that accompanies them.(She suggests introverts lean on their\nnatural ability to listen and let the extroverts do the talking! Brilliant!)\nKeyes doesn't claim that introverts can avoid adapting to society's expectations.\nIn fact, she provides tips for what to do when you have to act as if you are\nextroverted. Her refreshing take on this is that it doesn't mean becoming a\ndifferent person. Instead, she acknowledges that at some point you'll have to\nattend a brainstorming session or a cousin's wedding. Keyes gives you the tools\nto make it work.", "related": [], "rank": 1441971, "title": "The Advantage of Being an Introvert in an Extrovert World - How to Use Your Introverted Personality for Professional and Personal Success", "author": "Amber Keyes", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 32.0}

Her extensive industry background resulted in working as a consultant for Newham College, managing the Centre of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) for textiles, manufacturing and design projects. The results of the research undertaken by Alison with fashion and textile SMEs formed the basis of new vocational curriculum and the development of innovative business support and mentoring programmes for the fashion sector. Alison went on to run the Fashion and Textile Museum for six years where the constant demand from designers lacking the business and entrepreneurial skills they needed to set up their business led her to setting up Fashion Angel and the Fashion Angel Business Club. Alison was keen that others should have access to the same invaluable support, that she had been lucky enough to receive, having worked with a business mentor for a large part of her professional life.", "related": ["B00B7UUO4O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There seems to be no regulation in this industry, and it is now billions of dollars a year, even though 99.9% of Americans have water in their homes that meets or exceeds any guideline for water purity and safety in drinking.Alas, Water is now big business, with Coca Cola and Pepsi owning the majority of the market.All I can ask is:Are You Drinking Enough Water?", "related": ["B00KGBHR2C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

David is a dock worker who could have been much more had his family situation been more stable. He is a gifted artist and has an aptitude for science and mathematics. When David arrives in prison, he is fortunate in getting a cellmate who becomes his prison mentor as well as his friend. David becomes a force for good in the prison: establishing the Orphans, a group that help non-gang prisoners survive, talking a distraught prisoner off a roof after learning that his wife would leave him, and setting up a fund that would help ex-cons set up small businesses or find work and prosper after they are released.\"Portrait of a Prisoner\" is a riveting read, one I did not want to put down and was sorry to finish. Line creates real characters, both the heroes and villains, and there are both in this story. I particularly enjoyed David's imaginary cafe and looked forward to passages where Plato and Socrates would play with their coffee and discuss math, gravity and other topics. It was fun to see Plato employing Socratic method on Socrates. I love math and enjoyed any references to David's interests in that field; however, those who hate math will be relieved to find little actual math in \"Portrait of a Prisoner\". This is a positive and enlightening book, which was somewhat surprising given the title. It was surely an absolute delight to read.

As this story opens, the Morelands, living elsewhere, are still fabulously rich and successful, but Hidden Falls has not faired as well. Having read the two previous books, it's rather sad to revisit the town and find it in such miserable shape. However, this new twist keeps the storyline original. And although the Moreland family is familiar to some of us, and we once again meet the residents of Hidden Falls, they are all fresh, new characters that all seem to possess their own kind of charm. John, in particular, is an alluring man. Not only does he enjoy wealth and looks, but he has charisma as well. But, not surprisingly, like so many men, Claire finds he has issues when it comes to trust and commitment. Still, the author does well to make the reader care for him, when it is Claire who garners so much sympathy. She's passionate in her zeal to save what she loves, and their romance often parallels the storyline about the restoration of Fairlawn, and ultimately the fate of Hidden Falls. With both, there are ups and downs, risks to take, and a lot of soul-searching involved.In DREAM WEAVER, it is obvious that Hidden Falls and its residents are created with great fondness, and this loving attention produces a pleasant place to visit peopled with characters who ring true to life. Readers do not have to read the previous Hidden Falls Romances in order to enjoy DREAM WEAVER. It stands on its own as a sweet and gentle romance featuring likable characters. - Sandra Brill --Romance Reviews Today, August 2007", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has been a christian for 30 years and is still striving to be a good man of God. For more than 25 years, he has been affiliated with the U.S. military. First in the Army Reserves, then active duty Air Force, and now as an Air Force civil servant. His career has primarily been in the computer and information assurance world, with a couple of years in education. He taught Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.  His first book, \"Day by Day with God's Biblical Promises\" was published to the Amazon Kindle platform in October 2012. The motivation behind the book was to learn more about God's promises for his own Spiritual growth, but decided that others may benefit as well. He is an avid reader and life long learner.

In Secret of the Mummy, Bjorn Street tells an amazing tale about the\nyoung girl Hatshepsut who is devoted to her father, the Pharaoh Thutmosis I.\nShe follows him to learn what will be required of her one day to lead his\nkingdom. With the help of the High Priest Ani, Hatshepsut studies ancient\nscripture and practices elevating herself above her human form to attain the\nspiritual power needed to be a god on earth. Led by the Egyptian deity Amon,\nHatshepsut transcends mortal boundaries and takes on the mantle of leadership\nin spite of tragedies, intrigues, and plots by jealous officials.This story is masterfully crafted by Bjorn Street to provide a vivid picture of\nlife during the reigns of Pharaoh Thutmosis I and his daughter Hatshepsut. At a\nvery personal level, Secret of the Mummy offers a sympathetic look, through the\neyes of an enlightened leader, at the lives of the common people and slaves\nduring this period. Hatshepsut does not see things from the perspective of a\npampered, entitled queen but rather as merely one person among many others. She\nenjoys the friendship of her ladies-in-waiting, loves a commoner deeply, and\nhas concerns regarding the conditions under which others live.The questions created by the discovery of her tomb and especially one\nparticular artifact are puzzling to the 'experts' from all over the world.\nStreet uses a tremendous surprise to provide an explanation and opens the door\nto even more unfathomable questions in this excellent book about intense love\nand selflessness.", "related": ["B00GZHSDC4"], "rank": 2401161, "title": "Secret of the Mummy", "author": "Bjorn Street", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My one true achievement was, that, no matter how dumb that I thought I was, I never gave up. I pursued my dreams after retirement. You have to love what you are doing 24/7. Highlights: patrol boy; three years as an altar boy; getting as high as Star in the Boy Scouts, co-captain of our high school swimming team; attained the rank of Specialist 5th class in less than two years military service; graduated from Southern Illinois University. My only daughter Sara is my pride and joy. Her family includes Tony her husband and my granddaughter Gianna and another on the way. My wife Carol whom I married 10 years ago, is the only person to ever give me any credit and the confidence I need. To her I am creative, so I dedicate this book to her.

(New York Times)There is a special lesson in this story. ...Proto's readable, entertaining narrative on how a vital tool for environmental protection was born, midwifed by a bunch of law students, is a must read for tomorrow's environmental litigators and advocates. (Leon G. Billings)[To a High Court]captures the hopes, fears, slips, and slides of big-time environmental litigation. I wish every student of the law could share [such] moments: adversaries spanning the spectrum of trade association lawyers, oblivious agencies, and applause-seeking environmentalists. ...[such a victory is] harder to do today, but unwarranted optimism has always been behind the better moments of environmental law, and that can never be amended into oblivion or ruled out of order. (William H. Rodgers, Jr.)To a High Courtis consistently perceptive and a pleasure to read. A large part of the story's appeal is its setting in the personal lives of SCRAP's members (along with Proto's insightful digressions on the depredations of the coal industry, the ghost of Louis Brandeis, student anti-war demonstrations, Frank Norris and the insidious interlocking directorates of the nineteenth century). Proto examines not only the legal issues in the case and their historical backdrop, but also the everyday context in which SCRAP's members worked, played and thought... For the rising generation of public interest lawyers, SCRAP's story is a compelling case study of the power of resourcefulness, determination and audacity. (Stone, Antoinette R.The Philadelphia Lawyer)'It's a wonderful book that evokes not only the case but the five brave and intelligent law students who dared to take on one of the most powerful industries in America, as well as the federal government, and won,' says Peter H. Meyers, JD '71, professor of clinical law, who, as legal assistant to Banzhaf in the early 1970s, worked closely with the students and argued their case before the Supreme Court. (Jamie L. FreedmanGw Law School)This high drama of five law students confronting the Railroads' power and the government's failure is riveting. The story resonates with questions still central to citizens and legislators: what is the duty of government? And who advocates the public's interest?To a High Courtmay be a 30-year-old story, but its lesson for holding government accountable could not be more current. (Rosa DeLauro)[A]ccording to Chief Justice Roberts, SCRAP is back. (Linda Greenhouse)Today's decision in [Massachusetts v. EPA] is SCRAP for a new generation. (Chief Justice John Roberts in dissent)Students fighting Goliaths. A timeless theme, engaging characters and plot twists.A Civil Actionmerged withPaper Chase. I can't wait to see the movie! (Dan Lauria)To A High Courtis a fascinating and incisive account of a major Supreme Court decision. Scholars, students, and those interested in law all would benefit from reading this outstanding book. (Chemerinsky, Erwin)High Courtcaptured the hopes, fears, slips and slides of big-time environmental litigation. (William H. Rodgers, Jr.)To A High Courtdescribes, with captivating eloquence and logic, how the imagination and persistence of students can sometimes achieve more than professionals who are restricted by doctrine and imprisoned by caution.

Before buying the bar, I consulted with Sam Paparelli to help me in my decision making. I know Sam and knew that he had tremendous knowledge and expertise in owning, operating and running a bar to make it a profitable investment. After bringing Sam to the bar and showing him what my intentions were, he pointed out things to me that I would never have known. It could have been the worst financial mistake that I could have ever made. Needlessly to say, everything Sam pointed out to me was correct and the bar ended up in bankruptcy. Sam saved me from financial ruin.I knew for many years Sam owned and operated the busiest, most popular and most profitable bars in Erie and I will always be grateful for helping me out and pointing me in the right direction as he did.Today, I am an owner/operator of a Moe's Southwest Grill in Erie, Pa. and am in the top 5% in sales in the almost 500 Moe's restaurants in the country. Right now I am in development of our second Moe's   Restaurant in Erie and growing.I must say, had I had not consulted with Sam and bought the bar, my future would not look very bright and would have been a financial devastation.2052 Edinboro Road Erie, PA 16509                              Sincerely,                                                                                  Frank J. FerraroPaul SchofieldGold Crown BilliardsAndy's Ale House and GrilleBullfrog Bar3866 Peach StreetErie, PA 16509November 09, 2010To Whom it may concern:Recently. construction was completed on the Bullfrog Bar in Erie PA. It has been my good fortune to have Sam Paparelli lead and manage the construction team. I have been aware for some time, the expertise Sam possesses in all aspects and phases of construction which includes but not limited to concrete, steel, wood framing, finish work, flooring, electrical, plumbing, roofing ect. Sam brought far more than knowledge to the project. His everyday energy level, management skills and communicative skills increased productivity and quality of work performed. Sam set the bar high and got the best out of everyone. The Bullfrog Bar was a difficult project in many ways and brought unusual challenges. While trying to achieve a certain \"feel\" about the place, a handful of times, certain components had to be redesigned and built. Under Sam's leadership the normal friction that takes place between sub-contractors, workers and and the owner, was noticeable absent. Sam brought a pragmatic and \"we can do anything\": approach to the project.Sam developed a rigid schedule. Just when it looked like we may fall behind, an occasional all-nighter or weekend brought the project back in line. The Bullfrog Bar came in under budget and on time.The end product could not be better. It was a pleasure working with Sam and I look forward to having him play a major roll in any future endeavors..Sincerly yours,Paul ScofieldOwner/PresidentRed Lobster2040 Edinboro RoadErie Pa., 16509To Whom it May Concern: It is a great honor and privilege that I write this reference letter for my good friend and mentor Sam Paparelli. I have known Sam for twenty five years and worked for him for 6 years. I met Sam when I had just finished college and was working at a local fitness center. Sam worked out daily and owned and operated a night club in town.  He asked me if I would like to tend bar on the weekends as I had experience while in college. The decision to work with Sam changed the course of my life.  I decided to pursue a career in the hospitality industry as a result of the excellent experience that I had while working at Felix's night club. Looking back many of my coworkers also went on to careers in restaurant, bar and hotel management. The one quality that Sam has that contributes most to Sam's success in business is his vision. He has the ability to come up with a very clear vision of what he wants and then has the ability to communicate that vision to his team to inspire and motivate them towards that vision. He has the ability to walk into a business and analyze what it will take make it more successful. It has been an honor to be associated with someone like Sam and I hope to be able to work with him in the future. If there is anything that I can do to be of assistance please feel free to contact me. Email:jay_mcelhinney@yahoo.comSincerely:Jay McElhinneyGeneral ManagerRed Lobster", "related": [], "rank": 1321553, "title": "How to Start,Operate,Market,Promote and Own your own successful Bar/ Nightclub and Restaurant.

It was the start of a long relationship with the muse: over the years I wrote articles for the school newspaper, a national newspaper, dabbled in poetry, launched a couple of websites, blogs, penned a couple of novels, a few short stories and labored over many a screenplay.  I started writing in earnest in 2004 and, after thumbing through about a hundred books on How to Write the Perfect Romance, How to Write the Perfect Thriller, How to Write the Perfect Mystery…  finally decided to write something fun instead. By education I'm a political scientist and as you probably guessed from the name I was born and raised in Belgium, land of Tintin, JCVD, beer & chocolate, Bruges and the one and only Manneken Pis.

All four children are married and, along with their spouses, work with Dave and Joyce in the ministry.Believing the call on her life is to establish believers in God's Word, Joyce says, \"Jesus died to set the captives free, and far too many Christians have little or no victory in their daily lives.\" Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory. Her life is transparent, and her teachings are practical and can be applied in everyday life.Joyce has taught on emotional healing and related subjects in meetings all over the country, helping multiplied thousands.

She is officially old enough to know better, but refuses to grow up. She has been, at various points in her life, a jeweler, an artist, a counselor, a minister, a fitness instructor, a singer, counter-person in a coffee-shop, a lab tech, a research assistant,  quarter-staff master, a daycare worker, a high school English teacher, a kindergarten teacher, a stay-at-home-mom, an editor and a writer. She firmly believes in the Heinlein adage that specialization is for insects, and is still working on the tinker, tailor, soldier and spy parts of the list. Elizabeth started writing in grade school, mostly for her own amusement. Her first novel was written while a student at the Bronx High School of Science, where she was regularly accosted before class by her friends, who were looking for the next chapter. She still has that manuscript somewhere, and readily admits that it is absolute and complete crap, but one must start somewhere. Writing got pushed to the sidelines for a good number of years, until Elizabeth got involved in a play-by-email role-playing game that was completely story driven. That game rekindled her love of writing, and she teamed up with another player to further explore the lives of their characters. That exploration turned into a planned series of novels, of which the first two are complete.  Once Elizabeth started writing again, she found that she couldn't stop. A friend pointed out an open call for submissions for a Circlet anthology themed on the Tarot. She came up with an idea about a most interesting tarot reading that turned into \"The Hand You're Dealt,\" her first short story sale.  Elizabeth lives in Central Florida with her husband and son, and a most accepting circle of friends who are both very amused and very proud of the pervy, fetish writer in their midst.  Elizabeth can be found online at http://easchechter.wordpress.com/, or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/Elizabeth.A.Schechter.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When my father could no longer handle the cold New York winters, just as World War II ended, we relocated to Long Beach, California. We lived in a converted garage because all the apartments  were occupied by returning servicemen. I graduated high school in 1953 and went to work for the Navy Department. In 1954 I came to New York for a vacation and never left. I met my husband Mike as we crossed paths on a staircase in my cousin's house in Brooklyn - love at first sight. We married in November of 1955. I was nineteen when we married, had three children by 29 and was widowed at age 31when my husband died of pneumonia. We had been active in local politics and after his death I continued in that endeavor. I ran for a seat on the New York City Council representing the Borough of Brooklyn and won. Four years later I lost a race for Borough President of Brooklyn. I was appointed by then Mayor Abraham Beame to an administrative position in a city housing agency and stayed on for thirteen years, running several major housing programs. Subsequently, I managed residential housing in the private sector, including a highly successful high rise housing complex, Waterside Plaza. In 2002 I retired to my home in Sag Harbor, Long Island. I attended Brooklyn College and completed the course work toward a Masters in Sociology. From 1997 through 2001, I taught classes at the Real Estate Institute of New York University as an Adjunct Assistant Professor. Much of the course material on housing management and safety issues was incorporated into Safe Child~Dangerous World.  After retiring I wrote a play, a novel and several short stories for kids. The inspiration for Safe Child~Dangerous World came from living with my granddaughter since she was born in 2008.  When she was about 3 1/2, I started teaching her safety rules: hold on to the banister, sit still when you eat, don't put non-food items in your mouth, etc. We progressed to outdoor safety, bullying and more. Our discussions--and my background in security and safety--led to the creation of what was going to be a skinny little book for kids. After much research, plus observance of the devastating incidents and accidents happening all around us, I wound up with 16 chapters of vital information on how to keep children safe in in today's frantic-paced, distracted and frequently hostile environment.", "related": [], "rank": 4207910, "title": "Safe Child Dangerous World", "author": "Mrs. Ruth Lerner", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His creations include Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog, Ace Trucking, Al's Baby, Button Man and Mean Machine. Outside of 2000 AD his credits include Star Wars, Lobo, The Punisher and the critically acclaimed A History of Violence. Alan Grant's prolific creative record speaks for itself. Jim Baikie is co-creator of Skizz. In addition Baikie has illustrated Cursitor Doom, Future Shocks and Judge Dredd. He also cocreated the hard-hitting political super-hero series, New Statesmen, in Crisis. Mike Collins has illustrated American Gothic which he also co-created, Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper Sinister Dexter, Slaine and has written and illustrated several Tharg's Future Shocks strips. Steve Dillon is a fan-favourite 2000 AD writer and artist, and the creator of both Hap Hazzard and the Irish Judge Joyce.  Dave Elliot provided the art for a section of the classic Judge Dredd epic 'Oz' as well an episode of Tales of Mega-City One. Co-creator of the classic Bad Company, Brett Ewins has also contributed to A.B.C. Warriors, Judge Anderson, Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper and Universal Soldier.  John Higgins has illustrated Chopper, Freaks, One-Offs, Tharg the Mighty and Time Twisters. Barry Kitson is a fan-favourite 2000 AD artist, whose pencils have graced Judge Anderson, Tharg's Future Shocks, and Judge Dredd's appearances in both the Daily Star and in the Galaxy's Greatest Comic, where Kitson co-created the deadly martial artist Stan Lee! Garry Leach is a highly-respected artist who has pencilled Dan Dare, Judge Dredd, Tharg's Future Shocks and The V.C.'s. His career beyond 2000 AD is notable for his work on the legendary Miracleman, which he effectively co-created with Alan Moore. Brendan McCarthy was a key early artist for 2000 AD, and designed Zenith with Grant Morrison, and many of the perennially popular ABC Warriors with Pat Mills (and others). John Ridgway's graceful linework has brought many 2000 AD strips to life, not least his own co-creations Darkness Visible, Journal of Luke Kirby and Junker. Cliff Robinson is one of 2000 AD's longest-serving artists, having made his debut with a Future Shock way back in Prog 362! Liam Sharp is the co-creator of recurring, pint-sized Judge Dredd villain P.J. Maybe. He has also illustrated A.B.C. Warriors, Finn and Tharg's Future Shocks. Beyond 2000 AD, his work includes Batman, Superman, The Possessed, The Incredible Hulk, Magik, Spiderman, Spawn: The Dark Ages and X-Men titles. Will Simpson is the co-creator of Universal Soldier, and co-penciller of the classic Judge Dredd story 'The Dead Man' and painter of the hugely popular Rogue Trooper story 'The War Machine'. Aside from his own co-created Bad City Blue, Robin Smith has illustrated Future Shocks, Judge Dredd, Mean Machine, Rogue Trooper, Strontium Dog, Tharg the Mighty and Time Twisters.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I love books with edgy plots and adventurous characters who break all the rules. I love it when I'm kept guessing until the last chapter - and even then I'm surprised. And I do love happy endings. \"I couldn't find enough of the kinds of books I love. So I decided to start writing them myself. Stories that challenge our 'reality agreements' of how love and romance should work. Stories full of passion - and art and fashion and shoes and all those other things girls like. Lavish doses of laughter. And - of course - great sex.\" For most of her adult life, Violet Gregory has been a writer of one sort or another, starting with teenage poetry and editing her school newspaper. On leaving school, VG caused consternation among her teachers and family by announcing she was not going to be a writer at all, but intended to study fashion design. She quickly abandoned that idea when she realized she’d have to wear make-up and high heels to succeed in the fashion industry and went to University instead. This turned out to be an inspired decision, as she could wear her Dad’s old pajama top and monster slippers to class if she wanted to (and sometimes did). She failed almost every paper in her first year, but was influential in a number of groups around campus, including the women writers’ group Venus Envy and KAOS (Killing as An Organised Sport). Eventually she obtained a BA in French and English, one of the highlights of which was completing a year long Creative Writing paper with well known New Zealand author Albert Wendt. Since then, VG has worked mostly as a business writer and journalist, and has from time to time contributed chapters and editorial input to a variety of non-fiction books.  VG began writing her first romance novel in the late 1990s. She sent off four chapters to a number of publishers and received an offer to publish the completed book almost immediately. However, she was disheartened by the publisher’s request for the plot to be changed to meet their ‘formula’, and after many years of distraction, finally commenced a new manuscript in 2012. The 21st Century \"Butterfly\" saga is no traditional formulaic romance. The themes are erotic, edgy and challenging, and her characters make their own rules around combining love, sex and fidelity with the practicalities of friendships, family and work in ways that are modern, unexpected and ultimately empowering.", "related": [], "rank": 2369268, "title": "Butterfly", "author": "Violet Gregory", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The harsh Montana winters gave Lloyd the incentive to leave the rigorous ranching life and get a higher education. After attending college and becoming an educator, then school superintendent, Lloyd began to write of the early beginnings of the state he loves. Now retired, Lloyd continues to craft his novels. He researches his books and tries to make them historically accurate, with their characters true to the times.

Ms. Higgins easily grabbed me from the\nbeginning pages with the character of Alice.\nShe was such a funny character, even when she wasn't trying to be. She didn't\nhesitate to jump in and help a friend when she was being bullied, and I loved\nthe way she didn't let the charge nurse Melanie Moth intimidate her. I really\nfelt like Alice\ngot a new lease on life by going to the Sorrento Retirement Facility, and it\ntruly made me think differently about such places. The friendships that were\nmade were wonderful, especially the friendships Lily made; it was just what she\nneeded to boost her confidence. The character of Ruby Smith was great. I could\neasily imagine her, and honestly couldn't wait to see what she might say or do\nnext!There was never a dull moment with the story, and\nwhile there were a few serious moments, there were plenty of fun filled scenes.\nThe mystery woven into the story wasn't easy to solve and lent a cozy feel to\nthe story for me. While Just Wondering is the first book I have read by Jianna\nHiggins, it certainly won't be my last. Her writing style is engaging, her\ndescriptions are very realistic, bringing the characters and setting to life.\nAnyone who enjoys a well-written, humorous read with strong characters won't be\ndisappointed!", "related": [], "rank": 1468461, "title": "Just Wondering: Alice's Story (Sorrento Book 1)", "author": "Jianna Higgins", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Parents of younger kids who cannot read yet tell me that this is also a fun book to read to them. It is a longer story, about 11,000 words, and has only one illustration per chapter, but parents say they have read this to their children at bedtime and have broken up over several days, example, one chapter per evening.
