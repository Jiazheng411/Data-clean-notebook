The \"fey\" Nuala (last seen in 2001's Irish Love) senses that self-made Chicago lawyer and tough guy Seamus Costelloe is doomed after meeting him at a Milan music festival. Nuala persuades her beloved husband, Dermot, that they must find out why in time to prevent tragedy. Back in the Windy City, Dermot pursues the true cause of the century-old Haymarket Riot, while Nuala gives premature birth to their latest angel, Socra Marie, who has to spend several weeks in the neonatal ICU. Dermot does much of the legwork as Nuala recuperates and focuses on the baby, though her maternal duties don't stop her from running the show. The immigrant condition is very much on their minds, in both past and present investigations, and even life at home is affected by the hardships and prejudices encountered by new arrivals, especially in ethnically complex Chicago. There's a lot to keep straight in this one. When he isn't trying to help Nuala save Costelloe, Dermot is reading transcripts of the Haymarket trial and period newspaper articles, especially those penned by journalist Ned Fitzpatrick, who reported on the riot and its aftermath. Portions of Ned's diary, set in italic, can be slow going. Greeley lays the Irish on a bit thick for some tastes, but the double plot is rich with detail, while the couple's earnestness and good intentions are never in question.

After Sandy Comstock goes to juvenile court for some minor offenses, his understanding probation officer lines him up for community-service work as an assistant coach for a Police Athletic League team. This is just the ticket for Sandy, who loves baseball and believes himself to be an excellent center fielder. However, he is humiliated when news of his crime reaches his teammates. Fortunately, his family is moving to a new town and he has a chance to start again. Unfortunately, Sandy is so preoccupied with the fear that his new teammates will discover his secret that he fails to make friends. It's only after he learns to relax and be honest that he's accepted by his team, and his skills on the field can be appreciated. Despite the obvious message, this novel is not so heavy-handed that it gets in the way of the story. The action moves along at a good clip with plenty of stuff about baseball to balance out the accounts of Sandy's inner turmoil. The writing is always clear and the descriptions are accurate.

Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847.Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound.The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Abel Nema next leaves his Balkan hometown to seek the father who abandoned the family six years previously. In the unnamed city of his father's birth, Abel is hit by a car, and acquires a talent for language. Meanwhile, war breaks out at home, and rather than return to likely conscription, Abel goes on to a city called only B., methodically masters 10 languages in a university language lab (with no accent, no dialect, nothing... like a person from nowhere), picks up young boys and is aided by various people attracted to his good looks. Most prominent among them is a woman named Mercedes, who hires Abel to tutor her young son, Omar. A jarring collage of free and direct voices and perspectives comprises the imaginative narrative, which culminates in a surrealistic delirium in which Abel confronts his past. An grayness dominates the proceedings, and the book's take on being gay doesn't have much in common with U.S. norms or conflicts.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In junior high, she began falsely telling her classmates that her middle name was \"Louanna,\" because she incorrectly assumed that people would find rhyming names amusing.  Her sense of humor continued to diminish during high school, and it bottomed-out in 2004 when she earned her undergraduate degree in finance and accounting from Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis, where she graduated ranked first in her class.  Three years later, she earned a law degree at Indiana University - Indianapolis, graduating a distant second in her class.  Suzanna feels no bitterness about her second place finish because, in the end, one is the loneliest number.  Although law school did little to improve her humor, it did give Suzanna the opportunity to publish her first literary work, a masterpiece entitled, \"When Sex Doesn't Sell: Mitigating the Damaging Effect of Megan's Law on Property Values.\"  Unfortunately, despite the provocative title, few people outside of the legal profession considered the article a \"page-turner,\" and Suzanna was devastated when the Winter 2006 issue of The Real Estate Law Journal failed to appear on Oprah Winfrey's Book of the Month Club recommended reading list.  In her spare time, Suzanna practices law in the fifteenth largest state in the nation and spends hours tending to an army of unfriendly cats that were gifted to her by the previous owners of her residence.  Although rather unresponsive and seemingly unimpressed by her, Suzanna affectionately named the ringleader of these cats \"Friendo.\"  Suzanna is also the proud sister to a cat named Buddy, adopted by Suzanna's mother in 2006, and has one inconsequential human brother.  Both her mother and inconsequential brother copied her ambition of attending law school, the former doing so preemptively before Suzanna had the opportunity to attend.  At the time of publication of this book, Suzanna proudly boasts an excess of forty websites, not originated by herself, touting her various accomplishments and/or character flaws.  For more information, type the phrase \"Suzanna Hartzell-Baird\" into the Internet search engine of your choice.

Sold as a humane attempt to provide a livelihood for the Inuit when fox pelt prices plummeted, the scheme was, in fact, callously political. Canada wanted to plant the flag—and some people—on the uninhabited and largely impenetrable island, over which Greenland, Denmark and the United States had territorial aspirations, particularly as the Cold War intensified. A compact history of northern life adds context to the story of horrific exile, which McGrath humanizes by focusing on Josephie Flaherty, the mixed-race son of an Inuit mother and of American director Robert Flaherty, who created the cinematic sensationNanook of the Northin the 1920s. McGrath's account of inhumane deprivation is based on contemporary documents and astonishing interviews with survivors, who after decades of pleading to be repatriated to their homeland finally forced public hearings in 1993 that shocked Canadians and culminated in the 1999 creation of Nunavut, the world's only self-governing territory for indigenous people.(Apr. 5)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Authors include Lois Lowry, Anne Fine, Celia Rees, Melvin Burgess, and Meg Rosoff. The characters are middle-class kids who struggle with myriad challenges and changes, some of which are foisted upon them and some that are of their own doing. Meg Cabot's story, in which Allie Finklestein finds that being dumped by a questionable boyfriend isn't the worst thing in the world, especially when you are already halfway in love with your nerdy tutor, is the only humorous selection. Other stories revolve around more serious topics such as telling your family you're gay, learning about a parent's affair, and discovering that your sister is terminally ill. The best stories are those in which the main character must cope with a physical disability. In Malorie Blackman's \"Humming Through My Fingers,\" a well-adjusted girl who became blind because of diabetes teaches a boy a thing or two about sight and trust after he asks her out on a dare. In Rosie Rushton's \"Skin Deep,\" a girl who is disfigured from a bomb explosion learns that some boys actually like you for who you are as a person, not just for your looks. The stories show courage, creativity, and a core of toughness that is not always attributed to young adults.—Nancy P.

His dad is on the dole and spends a lot of time at the local pub, and his mom struggles to keep her son and husband from fighting. Then one day an idea strikes Liam like a bolt of lighting–he and his three mates should start their own band. Soon, Salamander is going to perform in the Battle of the Bands. But as Liam is playing the drums during their performance, a terrible accident sends his spirit spinning back through time to witness another band–one that his parents and a friend started when they were teenagers in 1986. He learns that the drummer, his father's best friend, died that night, and tries to prevent this tragedy. He also uncovers secrets about his own past. Page creates an interesting time-slip novel that addresses questions of what happens when a person meddles in his family's past. As complicated as it is, the author keeps the sophisticated story from being muddled and confusing. The dialogue is peppered with British slang that may not be instantly understandable to American readers, but the unfolding events and revelations Liam makes about his parents will keep older teens hooked.–Anna M.

It is based on a simple idea, that a young woman, Rachel, who receives a new heart in a transplant, begins to feel emotions based on the life of the donor, Sarah Williams. Before she died, Sarah was having a love affair with her husband's American lawyer, Robert. This results in the expected animosity between the two men when all is revealed, but after a big argument with her husband, Alex, Sarah is killed in a car crash. What confounds the matter is that there is an apparent mix up at the hospital, and Alex believes that Sarah's heart has been taken without permission. In his anger and loss, he sues for its return. In response, Robert volunteers to defend Rachel in the case. As Sarah's husband and lover begin a court battle over possession of her heart, Rachel begins to believe that Sarah has some unfinished business with both of them, and its up to her to get it done. An Affair of the Heart is a short book at about 152 pages. And although this is perfectly acceptable as a Kindle book at a low price, it may limit the popularity of the slightly more expensive paperback and hardback editions. It started out as a short story, and so by nature the characterization is a little light and the plot development a little swift, and with hindsight it probably would have benefited from a Barbara Taylor Bradford treatment. Despite this I still hope you read it and like it. If you are after a larger and more in depth romantic read, The Look of Love at 296 pages might be worth a look.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She remembers her struggles as a single-mom juggling the raising two lively sons and a job, and still trying to find time to write.  She'd find herself typing on her old portable typewriter late at night, recycling any papers she could get her hands on for her manuscripts.      Then twenty years ago she received a computer as a birthday gift and her life changed. In 1988 she sold her first article and short stories soon followed.  Today she's been published in a variety of media.      Pam lives with her husband and two dogs  in southeastern Pennsylvania where they are actively involved with their church.  Much of what she writes is driven by her faith.      As much as she enjoys writing, she treasures her time away from her computer when she can be with their five children and four grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gooley, a Fellow at the Royal Institute of Navigation, sets out to revive the ancient skills of discerning direction by reading the sky—and other forms of natural observation—in a book rich with fascinating tips (most tennis courts are aligned north-south to minimize the sun's glare; an outstretched fist doubles as a crude sextant) but freighted with pedantic pedagogy. Determined readers who pass through the thicket of words will be rewarded by a wealth of information. Much of it is commonsensical: pay attention to landmarks; stars in the night sky twinkle, but planets don't. Some of it is informative: moss doesn't always grow on the north side of trees, as many a Boy Scout has been taught. Moments are fascinatingly arcane: the author once determined the direction south by observing a \"bird-poo compass.\" Though too technical for easy reading, Gooley's energetic enthusiasm for the art of natural navigation is just enough compensation.

Her tale has everything, from bandits to insane elections to horribly delayed projects to the artificial insemination of the cows. The cast of characters, colorful in the extreme, includes a squatter cowboy who can fix almost anything, neighbors involved in vendettas, homeless bridegrooms, and women who take sewing seminars in the farmhouse kitchen hoping to make money from the new skills, in spite of the prevailing attitude that a woman's place was in the home. In spite of myriad setbacks, there is tremendous goodwill. \"Most Brazilians spent their salary the day they received it, and most shopkeepers put up their prices accordingly. If you were quick off the mark you might find an item in the supermarket going at last week's price, but the supermarket staff tended to be quicker than you were.\" Le Breton's can-do attitude and successful gerry-rigging makes her an entertaining MacGyver of the jungle.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a world that few of us will ever experience directly. However Jakob is not simply some extraordinarily quick, balanced, strong, aggressive fighter, he has worked out, with a little help from his friends, that his ability to perform in this extreme environment is a function of a lot more than the obvious advanced physical requirements and special set of skills that are a prerequisite in the cage.\n\nThis makes his lively, sometimes outrageous, narrative of his adventures particularly interesting. While there is much in what Jakob writes that I would challenge - even the title Going Mental contains what is for me the entirely objectionable Cartesian split that much the work that I have done in creating and developing NLP has designed to challenge. Consider, however the context - while I could well be wrong, I doubt that many of the professional full contact fighters concern themselves about such philosophical issues as the possibility of objectivity, the distinction between reality and experience, the issue of whether life has meaning or is it that we simply create the meaning in our lives. Jakob does. And this makes for a lively insight into this very special world.\n\nFor years, psychologists have attempted to classify Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) as a part of psychology, and I have refused this classification. Psychology has as its focus, the AVERAGE performance of various populations - who gives a damn about average performance; NLP (especially New Code NLP) has as its focus the extraordinary, the genius, in whatever field of endeavor. Here is a narrative about its consequences embodied in a cage fighter - have a look - the patterns are perfectly applicable to what you do as well as what Jakob does.

Fresh from high school, he entered the military as an x-ray technician. Rather than segue into a like-minded profession, Stuart did an about face to become a hairstylist, then feeling the need to experience the harder edge of life, he joined the Washington D.C. Police Department. To capture the gritty sights Stuart saw, he took up photography and left the force to pursue that dream in NYC. After the photography studio he worked for folded, he met a metal sculptor and became so intrigued, he converted a chicken coop in the woods into a live-in studio and taught himself the technique. From that humble beginning, the rudimentary craft expanded into the fine arts with sculptures in bronze and fiberglass and shows across the US, England and Thailand.  His passion for all arts soon segued into other areas: costume designer (top 100 designers in the book, Fashion: 2001); an art director for a modeling agency; fashion show designer; and on to become a top sculptor for special effects, sets and props in the entertainment industry with work in over thirty major films, hotels and theme parks worldwide. Stuart’s passion for art crossed boundaries into water feature design and computer illustration. During Stuart’s film career, he learned screenwriting skills firsthand, writing well over a dozen screenplays. To reach deeper into character and environment, Stuart took up narrative fiction where he’s completed many short stories and eight novels.   His first novel, BACK FROM THE DEAD: the true sequel to Frankenstein, was a finalist in 2005 WriteMovies International Contest. He was a quarterfinalist in 2009 Amazon's Breakthrough Novel Awards for his book, SHADOW HOUSE. Also in 2009 he was a semi-finalist in the International Writer’s Network Contest and semi-finalist in the 2009 WriteMovies International Contest with his vampire novel, ORIGINAL BLOOD. In 2010 he was a finalist with a full page erotic photo published in the coffee table book, “The World's Greatest Erotic Art of Today.” He continues on the journey.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Rereading Calvin and Edwards, he finds neglected (and surprising) resources in the Reformed tradition for seeing creation as a rich and wild theater of fulfilled desires. In the process he teaches the reader to share creation's passionate and conflicted yearning for God, and to join its praise of God's loveliness.\"--William Dyrness, Professor of Theology and Culture, Fuller Theological Seminary\"Exemplary! Christianity's ecological phase requires Earth-honoring retrieval and recasting of its deep traditions. Lane brings to the task a good historian's unflinching honesty as well as the pilgrim's personal passion. The result is Reformed spirituality transformed by its own strong sense of God's presence amid streams of earthly beauty across 'landscapes of desire.'

Called into evangelism by God.  My name is Richard Foster and I am a retired businessman and evangelist.  I have pastored over the course of my life and I feel that God has given me a mission.  My questioning mind has inspired many original programs and teachings as well as the inspiration for this book.  As a retired businessman I have had to make many decisions and choices over the years in my business.  I can now look back with hindsight and ask myself all those, \"what ifs\" as they would pertain to my life today.  That is really  the core of our story. It's about the choices we make and how those choices affect us immediately and all along our life journey. The Loneliest Shepherd deal with choices and how making bad choices can effect just about every aspect of your life.  At the birth of Jesus I wondered who it was among the shepherd's that had to stay behind and watch the sheep.  I wondered how that might effect that persons life, what his life might turn out to be like and where he might end up. While the story is purely fictional, I have taken true accounts from the Bible and created a \"what if\" story around them to help put into perspective just how criticle making the right choices really are. My prayer is that this encounter with David will cause you think more deeply about life than you ever have before.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whether you’ve got a hankerin’ for herb-crusted butterflied lamb, chili-lime marinated swordfish, charred corn with chili-aioli, or just a “real burger,”Bittman’s Kitchenwill inspire you to “get your grill on.” It embodies Bittman’s grilling philosophy, which is to say that it’s not simply about “cooking outside,” but rather a method, like sautéing or roasting, employed to conjure that signature smoky, slightly-charred taste that can’t be achieved by broiler or blow torch.--Erin Kodicek", "related": [], "rank": 658378, "title": "Bittman's Kitchen: What I Grill and Why (Kindle Single)", "author": "Mark Bittman", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The American President is assassinated in L.A. by a terrorist suicide squad. Shortly thereafter, an American 747 is hijacked to Libya, and when it sets off on its return flight home, it is carrying a deadly device, the second step in a plot by Libyan leader Muammar Khadafy, who plans to destroy Washington, D.C., in a nuclear holocaust. As Pearson's carefully structured plot unfolds, the FBI hunts down the terrorists' supporters while Delta Force moves to recapture the plane. Only the cooperation of Fidel Castro can save the aircraft and its passengers. FBI agent Art Jefferson, Delta Force captain Sean Graber, pilot Bart Hendrickson and other players are effectively characterized in economical prose. The suspense runs at a high pitch right up to the tense confrontation between Delta Force and the terrorists--at 20,000 feet over the Atlantic, with no room for error or hesitation.

The vast majority of what I've written is science fiction and fantasy, so my stories take place in fantasy worlds or alien planets. This one is set in an upper-class suburban neighborhood on good old Earth, and for me, that's an unusual setting. I don't know whether that enhances or takes away from the story, but since I prefer fantastical settings, I suppose maybe I might not have been as interested in the story or the location for this one. Despite that, I still think it's one of my better stories.What specific themes did you emphasize throughout the novel? What were you trying to get across to the reader?What I think I emphasized is that liberals are buttholes. Conservatives are buttholes. Both sides of the political fence are equally ridiculous. Even though I myself am a conservative, I truly tried to be fair and balanced (wink wink) in my portrayal of both sides. I hope I've written a book that, whether you're a liberal or a conservative, you'll come away thinking that your side got the better of the other. Either that, or both sides will think I was completely biased against their views, while favoring the opposing view. But really, I don't think any of the characters have anything to be proud of in this book. They're equally guilty, and I think I've been an equal opportunity offender here.Did certain parts of the book make you uncomfortable? I was really uncomfortable with what might be perceived as the racist aspects of the book. The \"N\" word appears quite a few times, and a few readers have objected to my identifying the races of the various characters. \"Why do I need to know that this kid is black?\" But you do need to know, because race is part of the plot of the book. Race really is a hot issue between conservatives and liberals, and I didn't think a book about a war between liberals and conservatives could get away with not pressing the race button a time or two. But I really don't have a racist bone in my body, honest.", "related": [], "rank": 2310429, "title": "Liberal vs. Conservative: A Novella", "author": "Scott Reeves", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These narrow parameters are necessary because so many talented songwriters are not interviewed. The 27 who are include Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Mick Jagger, Joni Mitchell, David Byrne, and Joan Armatrading. Flanagan's foreword discusses rock songwriting styles and methods in general. He then breaks the parade of songwriters into seven logical groups, including ``Southern Voices,'' ``Penitents of the Spirit,'' ``California Voices,'' and ``Emigrants.'' Each section is preceded by a brief introductory discussion, as is each interview. These discussions provide great insight into the history of rock and roll by placing the artists in context; the interviews then add insight into their various writing styles. Students and other interested readers of music literature, of songwriting, and of rock and roll will appreciate this well-organized, well-presented collection.

The village itself, its medieval church and the author’s own home, the old Huntsman and Hounds inn, yielded much to stimulate a historian’s curiosity and offered Peskett many opportunities for study. Further afield, after establishing exchange visits with the townsfolk of Medfield, Mass, USA, he researched and recorded the birthplaces of those early emigrants from East Anglia to New England who founded the Massachusetts town. Peskett’s interest in the Metfield Guardians owed something to the fact that they often held their meetings in his home, two centuries ago. Whatever the reason, he brings to this study not only a scholar’s eye but a way of seeing behind the formal entries in their Minutes to real people, some struggling with poverty and sickness at a time of great rural hardship and others devoting time and energy to assisting them in their plight.", "related": [], "rank": 2564288, "title": "Metfield Parish and Poor in the 18th Century eBook", "author": "Victor Peskett", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Killian dreams of finding pirate treasure, and enlists Alex in the search. What seems to be a game turns real when the boys meet a strange hermit. Although the man scoffs at the local legends of Captain Kidd's buried treasure, his island cave is filled with maps and charts. Killian steals a map that apparently shows the location of a treasure cache, and the boys begin hunting in earnest. As they search, however, Alex senses that Killian's single-mindedness may put them both in danger. The setting is skillfully described in this deliberately paced adventure story. There is also ample evidence to support the connection of Kidd to the region, although this exposition is imposed on rather than integrated into the story. Killian actually conducts a lecture, even insisting that Alex take notes, which are printed, textbook style, to give readers the necessary factual background. Killian himself is a complex and not particularly admirable character. He recklessly endangers both his friend and himself, and, in the end, his obsession proves stronger than his sense of loyalty.

The Beardon family farm, Redstone, gets by quite handily under the guiding hand of Guy Beardon, a passionate man known for his intellect and an acidic tongue that keeps neighbors at a distance. Sam Carter, a former student of his, is now his chief aide. Guy's wife, Miranda, and son, Roddy, provide minor assistance, while daughter Lilah is the apple of his eye and a major helper. Guy's awful death in a slurry pit at the beginning of the tale appears to be an accident, but further violence suggests it was not. His demise begins an unraveling of life at Redstone that threatens to overwhelm its inhabitants. Tope takes what appears to be a list of stock charactersAa stalwart RAF type, the local vicar, a bickering couple, the doltish farmhand, an adulterous wife, the town gossipAand imbues them with fresh definition. And shrewdly, she offers neither a clever police detective nor a bumbling one. Except for Constable Den Cooper, who provides Lilah a romantic foil, the police stay mostly in the background while Tope's large and memorable cast play out their parts with the inevitability of a Greek tragedy.

They need support and a good dose of reality when it comes to men and affairs of the heart, fantasies and meaningless sex with the rich and the famous.  These girls appear to have it all, when the truth is, they posses nothing except holes in their souls. Yet, to the people on the outside looking in, these groupies, pseudo girlfriends and whores appear to have everything.Reality is, they only have material possessions, fame and money and the three major things they seek and want most is missing, fidelity, loyalty and love.   When I began writing The GirlFriend Starter I researched and read stories on a long list of blogs. I also used a few of my friends experiences too.It was interesting reading the thoughts of other women and their encounters with various entertainers in the music and sport arenas but instead of writing about the women so many of us love to hate and call \"Groupies.\"  I decided to put a twist on it, and bring it down front from women that are a lot closer to the men and the business that makes them famous and desirable. The mistress, the chick on the side, the paid for company who just like you and me want more.I hope you find these characters real and relatable and when it comes to love, they are a lot like you and me.  At times it was difficult writing on such a broad subject that has been covered by so many authors people had addressed without being like the rest of the books. I wanted them to have real personalities to make the characters more real, and relatable. With this story I intend to give a different look into the women who have the fatal mistake of giving away their cookies before getting the man to treat them like a woman and not like a piece of pussy. There are a lot of women out there including myself that look for this fairytale, but alwaysmiss it because lust becomes the right now and relationship becomes the later. Always leaving them trying to figure out why they are not being cuffed to a man, but some fail to look at the way they approach the situation they are in. Women want to be in a relationship, but women are sometimes not patient enough. So I wanted to tell that side of love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope if you read one you'll go ahead and read the others. Then maybe even try one of my 16 novels. Might work. I hope so.My favorite of the four spooky short stories...Ghost Brother.

Poppy is ecstatic cleaning floors that stay clean and working in the almost sterile environment of the dairy. Her appearance improves with good food and regular baths, and Mrs. Goodall teaches her to read and write. Gradually, Poppy is given more responsibilities and is treated almost like a member of the family. Then Mrs. Goodall falls deathly ill, and Poppy faces a tough decision: Should she stay with the family who has given her so much or follow her heart and the man she's always loved?

The dialogue is extremely well-done and the action scenes are alive with excitement.No doubt we will read more of the adventures of Jethro Sping.Arthur Shoemaker - Tulsa WorldThe third volume in the Valediction for Revenge series opens directly after the Lincoln shootout leaves Lawyer McSween and several of his followers dead. Those who remain must decide whether to come back another day to fight the Dolan-Riley gang, or forget about obtaining revenge for young John Tunstall and ride away from Lincoln County. Jethro Spring, the young mixed blood with an Indian mother and a white father, has about decided to ride on, the Lincoln County War having no hold on him. But can he really desert Susan McSween, Billy the Kid, for whom he still feels some affection, and the poor Mexican and white farmers and ranchers, whose economic well-being is threatened by the Santa Fe Ring? Lincoln County is completely lawless. The President sends in Lew Wallace as the new Territorial Governor with orders to clean up Lincoln County. Spring becomes Wallace's investigator and tries to convince the governor to give Billy the Kid a pardon. Despite Wallace's good intentions the head of the Santa Fe Ring, Thomas B. Catron, is permitted to remain as New Mexico's Attorney General. Catron takes over the Dolan-Riley store and reinstates the control the Ring had in Lincoln County. Jethro is arrested by the corrupt sheriff, George Pippin, who is in Catron's pocket. Pippen is supported by a detachment of troops from Fort Stanton. To Lincoln County residents the bad times are back, and one can feel the hatred in the street. Afraid for his life Sheriff Pippen resigns, and with him goes the last pretense of law and order in Lincoln County. Although the residents feel the worst is over with the resignation of Pippin and the defeat of John Selman's outlaw gang, Jethro feels Lincoln is poised to explode. This fictional recounting of the aftermath of the Lincoln County War is by necessity filled with a multitude of characters, but Cheek succeeds in so clearly describing the various illegal maneuvers of the many participants on both sides of the conflict, that the reader is able to follow the action. By choosing the years immediately following the Lincoln War, Cheek is challenged to render the complexities of the political, legal, and commercial aspects of situation in Lincoln understandable to the average reader. He succeeds. Their association with a close knit cadre of territorial officials and military officers -- known as the \"Sante Fe Ring\" (the real power in the territory) -- allowed Dolan-Riley to control Lincoln County. John Tunstall, rancher and son of a wealthy English merchant, conceived the idea of a partnership with Alexander McSween to establish a business to compete with Dolan-Riley. At stake were the rich military and Indian Reservation beef contracts. Jethro Spring is drawn into the crucible of violence as the war breaks out in Lincoln County where he is acquainted with most of the gunman on both sides. As the tide begins to turn with a new Territorial administration, Jethro befriends the new governor, Lew Wallace, and becomes his confidant and investigator. Still he can't forget his past friendship with Billy the Kid and others who use him to further their own interests. As the trouble winds down, Jethro eventually becomes estranged from the unforgiving land and people without peace. Roland Cheek has used the history of the Lincoln County War and gives it a fresh twist. The dialogue is extremely well done and the action scenes are alive with excitement. No doubt we will read more of the adventures of Jethro Spring. --Tulsa World, Author Shoemaker, writerAgain, the writing of Crisis On the Stinkingwater follows Roland Cheek's pattern of thorough research, along with careful attention to historical detail and geographic accuracy. It's of a land and people before Buffalo Bill Cody arrived to apply his showman's hand to sanitizing even the country's name. The fifth in the \"Valediction for Revenge\" series finds Jethro Spring still on the run from a false charge of murder, in the valley of Stinkingwater River, where he files a homestead claim on a remote piece of land claimed by a greedy and powerful rancher. Jethro only wants to build his cabin and live quietly in peace; he doesn't want a confrontation with Ellis Burroughs. On the other hand, Jethro has no intention of being run off his land. His example leads other homesteaders to resist Burroughs, risking their lives to do so. Jethro partners with and old mountain man, Sam Buttercut, who knew Jethro's father and aims to help the son in his fight to keep his homestead. Lillian Mathers, the fiancee of Ellis Burroughs, and her father, Angus, join with Jethro and Sam to defeat the domineering rancher. Much of the book is narrated by Sam Buttercut, one of Cheek's most likeable and humorous characters, and it is Sam who passes judgment on Jethro's last action against Burroughs. In terms of the ending, Crisis on the Stinkingwater is Cheek's darkest book. It is also the most realistic. The portrayal of the depth of hatred engendered by the bitter conflict between rancher and homesteader chills the reader, as does the character of Levi Bunting, Burroughs's foreman. A villain as evil as Bunting is not often realistic, but seems made out of cardboard and painted black. Cheek avoids that trap. As black as Bunting's character is, he's still believable. All in all, Cheek has written another Western that is filled with suspense and unexpected consequences. --Roundup Magazine", "related": ["B00CTT66L2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": ["B00AECHQBK"], "rank": 3523381, "title": "Homemade Gifts For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions) eBook", "author": "D.C.

I am thankful that this novel never went to print in its primitive forms. I have learned many things from my rejections, and I have used those insights to revise, enhance and improve everything in this book. I had to walk away from it in frustration (at least a hundred times), but kept coming back to it, because I have always believed in it. It has survived a split into two books (part two--The Fire of Kings, coming soon), the additions of new novels behind its second part and the discovery that I had written all of it poorly--in the middle of the sixth book. That block was significant. I could not finish the story, and I could not figure out why I could not finish it. That led me to ask countless questions and figure out or wait on answers to those questions. It was not easy to work out where things went wrong or why, and it was challenging to correct my errors without tearing down the entire framework upon which the story was built. I adjusted the framework and gutted the content, but the story remains intact, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I adjusted plot lines, changed characters and re-shuffled arrangement. Surprisingly, little things made the biggest impacts in the long run of the story. The result is The Blood of Logant, the e-pub novel, fourteen years in the making and re-making. Thank you.

Although writing was Sandra’s deepest passion since childhood, her dream of becoming a published author had to be placed on hold for several years. Moving to a new country provided several challenges, the biggest one being the language barrier she encountered when she first arrived. In order to become fully integrated, Sandra tapped into her love for reading, and over time her vocabulary grew extensively. She gave birth to three children and devoted most of her time to raising a family. By the time she was in her late 30’s, Sandra decided to revisit her old passion for writing, and penned a novel of paranormal suspense, The Book of Obeah, followed by a self-improvement book, Housekeeping for the Soul: A Practical Guide to Restoring Your Inner Sanctuary. Both titles were sold to the same publisher and released in 2010, and The Book of Obeah went on to win an international book award. The Book of Obeah has been optioned for film, and production is expected to start early summer 2013. It will also be released as an audio book in the second quarter of 2013 by Cherry Hill Publishing, and narrated by Dave Fennoy, better known as the Hulu Guy. Currently, Sandra is working on two new novels: Shadows of a Tuscan Moon, and The Key. Killer in Sight (A Tom Lackey Mystery) was released in May 2012. Sandra Carrington-Smith lives in Raleigh, NC, with her husband, children and three cats. Killer in Sight (A Tom lackey Mystery) was released in May 2012.", "related": ["B005PFOIGW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.2308, "rating_total": 55.0}

It is great to read a book that both helps us to puzzle and points to the likely answers. When all that is done in clear prose, we have something well worth reading.' - Mick Moore, Professorial Fellow, Institute of Development Studies  'Tim Kelsall has written a seminal book that identifies the management of rents as the central factor determining the economic performance of African countries. Business, Politics and the State in Africa advances the debate on governance and development into a new and more productive field, and is sure to stand as a key text for the next decade.' - Alex de Waal, Executive Director, World Peace Foundation  'Revealing the evolution of Ghana's, Tanzania's, Ethiopia's and Rwanda's development policy and performance, the empirically-grounded narratives laid out in this book constitute a bracing antidote to the intellectual and ethical complacence behind the mainstream  championing of \"good governance\" and a \"level-playing-field\" business environment as ways forward for development. The authors' findings and conclusions are sure to be profoundly discomfiting for practitioners - in ways which contribute to, and hopefully will help, spur the new thinking which is urgently needed.' - Brian Levy, School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University and University of Cape Town, and formerly a World Bank governance adviser  'Recent growth trends in sub-Saharan Africa have been hailed by the proponents of neoliberalism as a strong affirmation of their policy doctrine. Tim Kelsall's volume not only challenges the triumphalism of neoliberals but points to the kinds of state and business coalitions that can generate policies towards structurally transforming African economies. The book combines solid theoretical reasoning with detailed case studies from Asia and Africa. A welcome and timely addition to the literature.' Howard Stein, Professor, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor  'Tim Kelsall provides fresh perspectives on an old post-colonial African conundrum.  He presents highly nuanced arguments grounded in empirical detail to hint at the possibility that some forms of \"clientelistic politics\" might actually conduce to development in African states.' - E. Gyimah-Boadi, Executive Director of the Ghana Center for Democratic Development/Afrobarometer and Professor in Political Science, University of Ghana 'Offering a fresh and sweeping perspective that provides insight into the necessary political conditions for economic development, Kelsall demonstrates how contemporary African regimes can move their economies toward more productive trajectories. Rather than reviving the familiar nostrums of good governance and best practices, this book argues that regimes (and potentially donors as well) should \"work with the grain\" to solve basic collective action problems that will enable economic change. This concise, compelling and readable argument will be useful for advancing the understanding of scholars and practitioners alike.' - Peter Lewis, Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies  'This is an important and original book, which deserves wide circulation, particularly within the aid industry. Laying to rest the assumption that \"good governance\" is the pre-condition to development, it offers an enlightening model of how \"development patrimonialism\" can, under specific conditions, be harnessed for the type of sustained economic growth that may lift African countries out of their \"underdevelopment\".' - Patrick Chabal, King's College London", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her parents' penchant for traveling the world, via a Volkswagen Minibus with a Porsche engine, sparked her imagination. Staring out the window, sometimes through fog and rain, at other times at blue skies, she began to make up stories for the places and spaces they passed by. The in-between time, the most fascinating to her. The imagined world has always fascinated Celia. She has studied Landscape   Architecture, Architecture, Interior Design, and every other subject matter.   Though she eventually graduated from the UW in Seattle in 1996 with multiple degrees, she began her college career in 1983. Like her childhood, it was the ride that was the most entertaining, arrival at a degree, not anywhere as important. \"Write what you know,\" is a common enough phrase. When combining this concept with her unusual life experiences (working at a Nuclear Submarine Base when Chernobyl blew, testing software Bill Gates kept close tabs on, travelling extensively while quite broke, falling in love with her boyfriend's close friend) thinking of what to write about isn't challenging; there just needs to be more hours in the day.

Curiosity of pioneer life, herbal medicine and figuring out how to do things other people only dream of, all influence her writing. Finishing college as a 38 year old wife and mother was a challenge, but well worth it.  After completing a Bachelor’s degree in business and education, Peggy earned  a Master’s in Management. She began teaching business and computer classes at a nearby college, and then for the public school system. Currently she is still married to her wonderful husband of 37 years and living a few miles from her childhood home.  Their children are grown and married and have produced two delightful grandchildren. Peggy’s time is spent volunteering at their school, writing books with her good friend, Maggie DeCocker, and teaching college courses.", "related": ["B00GFZZAO0"], "rank": 960629, "title": "Eaton Creek (An Eaton Creek Adventure Book 1)", "author": "Peggy A.

A cofounder of the German Communist Party, Luxemburg expressed unfailing passion in her letters (supplemented here by substantial footnotes), revealing her personal sacrifices even while chastising colleagues who failed her. Among these were lovers addressed in early naïve, love-torn letters. Later, lengthy missives expressed well-considered economic and political stances, referring to her published works, and her censored letters, sent while imprisoned for agitation against WWI and insulting the Prussian king, exhibit delicacy when discussing the safe subjects of botany, wild birds, and her beloved cat, Mimi. Using her extensive information network two decades before WWII, Luxemburg accurately predicted the \"pogroms against Jews in Germany.\" This volume gives personal insight into a remarkable (and controversial) woman, who was assassinated at age 47, and adds meaningful context to any study of early Western socialism.

(I loved it when readers bypassed me and wrote directly to my characters.)     A recent reviewer of the Kindle edition suggested that fans of TV's 'Downton Abbey' would enjoy this novel as it follows the lives of aristocrats and the working classes in a sweeping, fast paced adventure that moves from the stately mansions and bustling streets of England to the Australian penal colony, Alta California, the Sandwich Isles (Hawaii) and New Orleans. Looking back, I recall the mountains of research in the days before Google!     I worried a little about how my relatives and friends in Australia would feel about the penal colony segment of the novel, but hope they realized that free settlers vastly outnumbered the transported convicts. (My brother and his family emigrated to South Australia.)      Researching the Spanish 'Californios' and the early days of Hawaii both saddened and intrigued me, making me appreciate that while we humans still have plenty of faults, we've come a long way since then.     One of the pitfalls of writing historical sagas is losing oneself in the research - an author has to remember that only about ten percent of it should be woven into the fictional story, but the rest is needed to provide accurate details of the time and place.     I started out writing contemporary mystery/suspense and was steered toward historical romance by my first publishers (I hated history in school - educated in England I had to learn all the royal houses, kings and queens and dates, which I found boring. When I married my American husband  before becoming a citizen I took a course in American history - and was fortunate enough to have an excellent instructor to spark my interest. He later was appointed to West Point to teach the cadets.)     I hope the new generation of readers of the Kindle edition enjoy FAR HORIZONS.

The broad analysis is insightful, and the case studies highly instructive.

In compelling fashion, the authors introduce us to the activists, journalists and lawyers who are fighting for cleaner air and water, and to the institutional obstacles that remain in their path. This is a must-read for anyone who has heard about an environmental protest in China and wondered not only what the real story behind it was, but also which way the story of China's \"green revolution\" is heading.\" - Gady Epstein, China correspondent,The Economist\"There have been very few stories of China over the past decade more important than the decline of the environment and the rise of civil society.

My Niece Jo prompted me to write this book  'You hold so much knowledge and women in your care celebrate birth. you need to share that knowledge so other women can celebrate birth  as no woman should feel traumatized about their birth experience\"  I took a while to think about what Jo said and yes I can make a difference for around 60 women a year but there are millions of women around the world that are deprived of the continuity care of a midwife. Women in New Zealand have choices about  their care and they can choose to deliver at home, birthing unit or hospital and they can have a midwife to see them through their entire pregnancy, childbirth and for six weeks after the baby arrives. Providing holistic midwifery care and by giving  good dietary advice and the use of complimentary therapies such as homeopathy, chiropractor, acupuncture. 95% of women in my care celebrate uncomplicated childbirth, and the 5% that need help are well informed and still get to celebrate birth.  So I put all of my experience and case scenarios in a book to make a difference for moms to be all around the world. so they can celebrate their childbirth experience. They don't need to fear childbirth, they need to understand it and then they can embrace it after all childbirth is not only a physical event it is a spiritual event, That is the greatest gift bestowed upon us that is the ability to birth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Movements in Art since 1945, first published in 1969, has been continuously in print since that date.

Plus, he learned\nmore about his own mother and the strong bond she and I had, and\n    the depths of my depression after she passed away in 2000.This book lays the groundwork for a major transformation in my life,\n personally and professionally, and explains why I \"do what I do\" ... write\n and speak about coping with the emotional side of\n    catastrophic injuries, illnesses and diseases. The empathy that I\nhave for individuals and families going through these challenges is\ngenuine as I understand the rollercoaster of emotions and\n    feelings that can guide or derail us. It's our choice more than we\nrealize.When you read \"Meet Me in Myrtle,\" revisit your thoughts and\nexperiences in coping with the loss of loved ones and what you learned about yourself at the same time. Always remember that there is great hope and countless rewards by\nthe simple act of sharing love. Connecting with fellow human beings IS\nwhat life is all about.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

S. Lewis [was] one of the very best critics writing in English in the twentieth century, vivid, provoking, and eloquent, as well as deeply learned in the literature of Europe from the ancient classics to his own time, with a special mastery of medieval and Renaissance poetry. He is now popularly better known for his fiction and his religious writings than his literary criticism. But it is his gifts as a critic which will endure as his truly pre-eminent legacy. Like Samuel Johnson, on whose personality and writings Lewis modelled himself, he is a commentator whose insights and opinions are enriching even when one disagrees with them, raising central questions and offering challenging perspectives ... There is no essay by Lewis on any writer that does not provoke attention and inspire awe at his energy and clarity of mind.'

Here's a brief taster of how we wrote this novel:We had already written Clovenhoof, so we knew a lot about our fictional world, and most of the characters. The end of Clovenhoof saw Archangel Michael banished to earth. It added a nice finish to that novel, and gave us the jumping-off point that we needed for this one. Having said that, it was really important to us that this novel stands alone, so a top priority for this book was to make sure that people who haven't read Clovenhoof are not short-changed in any way.Pigeonwings is partially set in Wales. We went for a road trip to go and research some locations, with permission from our respective families! It's about a 4 hour drive from Birmingham to the Llyn peninsula, so we had a great opportunity to discuss our characters and plot on the way. The locations in the book are all real, although the monastery that we use is sadly now a ruin.While we were writing Pigeonwings we attended a course run by veteran sitcom writer, Keith Lindsay. It was good to see how much we were doing right, and it helped us to tweak a few things to make the most of the comedy.We worked through the chapters like\nthis - Heide plotted a chapter for Iain to write while Iain plotted a chapter\nfor Heide to write. Then we wrote those chapters, and swapped back to the other\nperson to do an edit. This helped to smooth out any stylistic differences.Leap-frogging like this, we were able to write the first draft of Pigeonwings in around nine months.", "related": ["B00H6YCGDM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yeah, a gravestone. In the dark. At a cemetery. Life\nwas never dull as a teenage supernatural hunter.           Blake's\nblue eyes glistened for a second under the nearly full moon. He shook his head\nin a negative. We sat, our backs leaning against the angel statue, hiding, I\nmean,huntinga supernatural\ncreature. The wind had a bite of moisture. It would rain soon.           \"The\nold caretaker is probably locked up tight in his little house.\" He'd been the\none who'd come knocking on Oz's door atop Chapel Hill, scared spit-less,\nyelping he'd seen something crawl out of grave. No one really knew about Oz, what he was, but they'd heard\nthe myths and legends of the old man atop Chapel Hill, the tallest hill that\nlooked over the town of Montgomery. So Oz sent us to investigate. There'd been\nghoul evidence, all right--half-eaten cats and gophers. Serious stink. Only\nproblem? The grave had swallowed back up as if a supernatural monster hadn't\ncrawled out of it.           Sure,\nall was normal. Not in this hunter's life.           Blake\nsmiled. \"He has crosses hung at ever entrance.\"           \"Too\nbad they don't work on ghouls. Don't know how we're going to find the right\ngrave.\"           \"We\njust have to. Oz said grave dirt from the grave is the only thing that will get\nthe ghoul back.\" He slid me a look. \"I guess its not the best date night, huh?\"           I\nsmiled and shrugged. What was a date night between us, anyway? We'd been\nhunting partners for nearly a year and just recently Blake became my\nboyfriend. It gave me a thrill at\njust the thought of us together.Blake was pretty hot, with shaggy brown hair, blue eyes, and a grin to\nmake you swoon. But the truth was I wasn't the typical girlfriend who liked\nflowers or love poems and stuff.           I\nwas a certifiable monster butt-kicker, thank you very much.           But\nBlake? He was the type of guy who would be with a girl like that. It still\ntripped me out that he'd chosen to be with me.           Blake's\nhand shot up. \"Shhh.\"           In\nthe quiet that surrounded us, a twig snapped. I stilled.           Blake\nstarted to lean toward me. He didn't get a chance to say anything. An arrow\nripped through the air between us, fastening to the statue, the tail vibrating\nin midair.           My\neyes widened. An arrow actuallycutinto freaking cement! \"Blake--\"           \"Just\ngo! Go! Watch your back!\"           Blake\nand I split apart and ran.           Breaths\ngushed from my mouth, my hair a wild, cloak behind me. I pulled a blade from my\nleg holster and gripped the MG, short for monster grenade. Oz concocted potions\nin small leather bags that worked against the supernatural.           Unfortunately,\nthe ghoul was already dead. What could harm the dead? They weren't exactly\nzombies without brain function. According to Oz, ghouls were cunning, evil, and\nviolent. Evil souls who had returned from hell.           And\nworst of all? These things were hungry for flesh.           My\neyes barely adjusted to the dark as I scanned for another place to hide. Found\none up ahead. I picked up speed and ducked behind a large cross. Dry leaves and\npebbles scattered. I was breathing too loud. I swallowed. Tried to control my\nbreaths.           Then\nI heard it.           The\nghoul scurried behind the stone. My stone. Too close.           Growling.\nSnarling. It sniffed the air.           I\nheld my breath.           Squeezed\nthe MG and blade.           The\nghoul swooped in front of me. I couldn't scream. I was frozen in shock. Not\nproud but even in the darkened night I could tell this thing was butt ugly. A\nghoul was apparently part decaying flesh, part human, part hell hound.           The\ncreature hissed. Yellow eyes glowed. Rotted, sharp teeth opened wide, and a\ntongue with blisters hung out like a long snake. Patches of hair stuck out from\na mostly baldhead.           I\nfinally snapped out of my shock long enough to throw the MG at its sunken\nchest. The grenade blew. Smoke engulfed us.           The\nghoul howled.           A\nsharp-nailed hand swooped out and smashed against my head.           Pain\nexploded in my skull. I hit ground.           No,\nno...           Everything\nwent dark.* * *           \"Jaz.\nJaz, come on. Wake up. Jaz,please.\"           I\nopened my eyes, slowly. \"Blaaa,\"\nI breathed. I couldn't even\ncomplete his name. He blurred before me.           I\nshifted--pain speared through my brain. \"Uhhh.\"           \"Don't\nmove too fast.\"           After\na moment I managed, \"I...live.\"           \"Looks\nlike, cupcake.\" His voice was strained. I could tell he was trying too hard to\nmake light of the situation. Blake\nwasn't just my hunting partner or recent boyfriend. He was my ultimate best\nfriend. Like super ULT.

The French forces were no match for a Nazi blitzkrieg featuring massed tanks, armored vehicles, Stuka dive bombers, and swift moving infantry. The government had no choice but to accept humiliating terms of surrender. Harsh reparations were imposed on France, Hitlers revenge for the Treaty of Versailles. General Ptain, the hero of Verdun in WW I, a figurehead father image, was installed in the puppet Vichy government that strictly followed Nazi orders. The Germans plundered Frances food, drink, and art; the French were reduced by drastic rationing to a nation in perpetual need. The feared Gestapo was much in evidence, and Vichy stooges cooperated with the Nazis in rounding up Jews, communists, and dissidents. The rsistants grew in number, and the Germans responded by executing more and more French citizens. A French civil war between Vichy loyalists and underground patriots broke out, adding to the suffering. The rsistants suffered high casualties; their charismatic leader Jean Moulin eventually paid with his life. After the German surrender the nation was transfixed by anger, frustration, and shame. The French focused their violent fury on a variety of individuals and groups viewed as having betrayed France. The haughty, immensely self-assured Charles de Gaulle, head of Free French forces, quickly stepped into the power vacuum left by the war, setting France on a new and increasingly controversial course.  A well-written, carefully researched, often fascinating story of the long and little known French ordeal. (16 pages illustrations, not seen)  --Copyright ©1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But if, to put it mildly, compassion has never been his strong suit, this is his play which most elicits genuine empathy. -- David Benedict Variety 20130619 Written with verbal brio and gleefully scant regard for sensitivities -- Sarah Hemming Financial Times 20130619 McDonagh - with his mastery of caustic dialogue - has drawn such weird, funny characters ... that this black comedy comes across as strangely celebratory of rural misery. Time Out 20130619 McDonagh refuses to romanticise ... emotionally cunning plot and themes of romanticism punctured, trapped rurality and the power of stories true or false ... each character has its own rhythm and eloquence, absurdity and dignity ... as ever in McDonagh, a jagged, violent darkness feeds the comedy, and laughter glistens in the deepest despair. In its final moments the see-saw of hope and tragedy moves so fast you gasp. -- Libby Purves The Times 20130619 A gloriously perverse writing talent ... playing with Irish stereotypes, flaunting the scabrous and outrageous is McDonagh's stock in trade ... his gift for teasing with comic caricature romps away ... language to bite on and speeches that ring with unusual cadences. -- Susannah Clapp Observer 20130623 Packed with cranky characters, running gags and entertainingly rude slurs, plus psychopathic moments -- Kate Bassett Independent on Sunday 20130623 As soon as you encounter any literary representations of 'the real Ireland', you enter the world of myth and myth-making, and the play has great ironic fun with all this. It's a mash-up of Irishness and stage Irishness, poverty and groping priests, ignorance supplemented by an utterly untrammelled imagination, a pastiche of Synge and Yeats and all that old Oirishy ... But there's also a genuinely haunting sense here that your impoverished Irish peasant, before cars and TV and radio and the net, really did have a freedom of imagination now lost -- Christopher Hart The Sunday Times 20130623 Wistful ...

Her career in publishing started in the 4th grade with  a story about a magic, museum-hoppping chair. Now,  Mindy writes young adult, new adult, and adult paranormal romance. Her books always include tormented heroes, snarky heroines and lots of swooned moments that will put a smile on your face or make your heart race. Mindy is the lover of a good romance, the underdog, and John Hugh's 80's teen movies.  When her toes aren't in the sand or her mind isn't in the clouds, Mindy loves hearing from readers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 36.0}
