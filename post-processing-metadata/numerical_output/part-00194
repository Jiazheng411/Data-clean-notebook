In this illuminating bio, University of Limerick professor Lodge (Politics in South Africa) shows how Mandela's struggle for equality brought him to prominence. Though Mandela is hardly lacking biographers, Lodge makes an important contribution with his argument that Mandela's appeal rests on his ability to personify his political beliefs. Mandela's politics, which emphasize a mix of authority, empathy and respect for all people, are mirrored by his actions and behavior toward everyone he's come in contact with, thereby allowing his personal grace and dignity to be a political gesture. According to Lodge, Mandela's magnanimity serves as a model for a new kind of citizenship, one that embraces difference and the messiness of democracy without sacrificing the gentlemanly restraint Mandela associated with English political institutions. Lodge is careful to give Mandela an assertive role in this process, showing how he cultivated his own life story and his status as a martyr for justice in order to hasten the coming of democracy to his country. Vivid descriptions of the daily horrors of apartheid and the men and women around Mandela, such as his ex-wife Winnie and the troubled F.W. de Klerk, reveal the complicated world that Mandela ultimately and triumphantly managed to change. 17 b&w photos not seen byPW.(Sept. 30)Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The artwork that is included is typical for any business and I have seen it used extensively in powerpoints and handouts.I could see this workbook being useful if a person is burned out or just starting their career. It would probably be helpful to a college student that was have a difficult time trying to determine their major. The assessments provided a wide scope of different areas and did not just focus on a particular field like other workbooks I have seen. There is an opportunity for you to really compile a wide range of information about yourself and plug it into an overview to help get the big picture. There are some limited references and a large area to write down thoughts. The goal section has clear time frames that I believe every goal setting session calls for.There is a very interesting chapter on developing patience. I found this chapter the most interesting and the most useful. It would be nice to be able to just use this chapter for my subordinates and peers in my current job.Overall this was an interesting experience and I enjoyed filling out the workbook, Discovering Your Passion. I would certainly recommend it to my co-workers and friends that are experiencing moral problems or dissatisfaction with their current job. --Reviewed by A.J.

At the peak of their popularity Bea is savagely beaten by a jealous actor. Unable to dance again, she marries director Donovan, who is devoted to her despite his homosexuality. Donovan pushes her into dramatic roles, which open a new Oscar-winning career for her. Allen's attempt to evoke the Hollywood atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s is a bit heavy-handed, but the book picks up power in the last half as Bea deals with an increasingly estranged daughter who writes a Mommie Dearest- type memoir.

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle'scomplete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's \"a real Creeper!\" What distinguishes this particularHoundis its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt toEdgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. \"The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,\" Watson realizes. \"Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.\" Read on--but, reader, watch your step!--Tim Appelo", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The daughter of a migrant worker, Isabel is abandoned as a baby and raised by a kindly godmother until her early teenage years, when she is sent to work as a servant for a local aristocratic family. Later, she becomes entangled with prominent bachelor Fernando FornarÃ­s, and things heat up: a pregnancy, her foray into selling black market booze and an expansion into becoming not a madam, an emancipated woman at a very steep cost. A complicated look into the notorious woman's struggle for a liberated and independent life, the book takes a boldly feminist stance that, thankfully, is not a woeful account of maternal guilt. The style can be heavy-handed, but Isabel remains, to her tragic end, a marvelously constructed character.(Aug.)Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now 15, going by the name Cathy Ferris and living with a kind foster family, she starts summer school in her old tony hometown of Greenwich, CT, hoping to get news of her parents and possibly reconnect with her extended family. But she never expected that her cousin Tommy would recognize her, or that the FBI agent assigned to their case would reappear and want to use her as bait to catch her parents. Cooney has crafted another thriller with a lot of appeal. With chapters alternating between Murielle's past and Cathy's present, readers will speed through the pages. The book couldn't be more relevant in light of the Bernie Madoff scandal; Cooney's adaptation of a complex fraud story for this age group is interesting if one can look beyond some weaknesses. For example, Cathy's classmates at times come across as unrealistically invested in the possibility of Cathy being Murielle. This book will appeal to the same crowd that's been reading Cooney's reluctant-reader-friendly titles for years.âJennifer Barnes, Homewood Library, ILCopyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this tender novel, he paints a richly detailed portrait of Molly, a drug-addict's daughter sent at the age of 12 to live with a great-aunt she has never met. Molly soon discovers others like her in this small town full of secrets. Next door lives Will, another \"stray,\" whose father is rumored to be in jail. At the library, she meets home-schooled Tracy, from the wealthy district across town, whose sheltered life may not be quite as comfortable as it appears. And through Aunt Fay, Molly meets Mrs. Voorhees, a hypochondriac who employs her great-aunt as a nurse. Although Molly sorely misses her mother and resists admitting that her stay with Aunt Fay is permanent, she nonetheless becomes involved with the people around her and gradually settles into her first real home. Peck cleverly employs Molly's outsider status to great effect, allowing readers to learn about the characters along with Molly, via her first-person narrative. He draws indications of her assimilation with subtlety and exquisite pacing, over the course of a year in his protagonist's life. As Molly's affection for Will and overworked Aunt Fay (whose phrases she begins to imitate) solidify, she begins to accept that her mother may never return. This sensitive heroine is one readers will want to take under their wing?and will bid her a fond farewell at the story's gratifying conclusion.

I'm a writer, photographer, mother, and lifestyle connoisseur living in Austin, Texas-a respite from New York, where I was born and raised.In January 2004, I began stephanieklein.com. At its center is my blog, Greek Tragedy, named both after my heritage (I'm a quarter Greek) and a humbling experience in the Greek collegiate system-not to mention my tendency to be a bit, oh, dramatic. It's where I tell things straight up and unfiltered. I blog for many reasons, mainly it's my \"throat clearing,\" an online journal of thoughts and questions I try to write for myself. As my life changes, so does my blog.The Independent in London discovered my \"life-changing\" blog the summer of 2004, when they dubbed me, \"The Internet Queen of Manhattan.\" Prior to this, I was unaware of my site's popularity. But when I was later featured on the cover of The New York Times Sunday Styles section, in July 2005, I learned Greek Tragedy was in the top 1% of all blogs (including all those political blogs out there).My first memoir Straight Up And Dirty is now available in bookstores (hardcover & paperback & Kindle). Based on the book, I created a half hour comedy series for ABC Studios, and wrote the pilot for ABC.My second book, MOOSE: A Memoir (also available in hardcover & paperback & Kindle) is a coming-of-age memoir about a time in my life I affectionately refer to as The Thunder Years-it's about my time spent at fat camp, with the nickname Moose.Jump straight to the beginning of GREEK TRAGEDY to see where this all began. Thanks for stopping by, chiming in, and connecting. What I love best about this blog is that the people in our lives who are most important to us now, aside from family, began as just strangers. So many people who've become like family to me now connected with me through little white email screens and IM windows, across cities, and states, tweets, and facebook statuses.

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does.

What makes Callow's memoir of the familiar uncertainties of an actor's life pleasurable is this actor's eccentricity. He revels in spinning tales of failed shows, arrogant directors, Oscar Wilde reincarnations such as MacLiammoir, who became Callow's first mentor, and the craziness of the profession. Stardom doesn't seem to be a preoccupation with him, and the adventure of creating unique characterizations, such as his Orlando in As You Like It, is perhaps his reward, especially when he astonished London with his portrayal of Mozart in the original staging of Amadeus. Callow is opinionated and an outspoken protector of the performer's right to interpret character, but he finds today's actors at the mercy of ambitious directors: the director \"has interposed himself between actor and writer, claiming that they cannot speak each other's language.\" Actors and non-actors alike will find this witty, knowledgeable book delightful.

Orrick, however, is not thrilled about being gifted with the king's former mistress but realizes that he has little choice. At first he tries to woo his new wife with kind words and thoughtful gestures, but sharp-tongued Marguerite, who was trained to be the consort of a king, is less than pleased with her new status as the wife of a \"barbarous\" northern lord. But what begins as a marriage in name only becomes something much more real as Marguerite realizes that despite her objections she is falling in love with her new husband. With a superb gift for characterization, Brisbin creates a complex, completely fascinating heroine in strong yet vulnerable Marguerite, and her bold, vivid writing beautifully captures the flavor of medieval castle life and the intrigue-rich Plantagenet court. Passionate and romantic,The King's Mistressis a rare delight.John CharlesCopyright Â© American Library Association.

So when Marni is involved in a tragic diving accident, Lace is suddenly on her ownâlearning how to tread her way through a summer of changing relationships with new and old friends while adjusting to the presence of Willa Dodge, a seemingly mysterious woman sent to live with the Martins as they adapt to their new reality. While Willa cooks, cleans, and swims in the lake beside the Martinâs house, Lace begins to unravel truth from fiction about Willaâs intentions, why handsome Sully Tanner asked her out, and what exactly happened at Turtle Rock that so profoundly changed everything. Beautifully-written and full of evocative language and poignantly-drawn scenes, Hannah Roberts McKinnonâs second book,The Properties of Water, is a tender look at the bonds between friends and family, and the lessons one learns while growing up, through the eyes of a young woman who nearly learned what it would be like to lose everything. --Jessica Schein", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a child, Samantha Curtis sent a hooded rapist hurtling to his death as she fought off his attack. Thereafter, her periodic dreams of that frightening event have preceded personal tragedies. After the last dream 25 years ago, her parents died in an automobile accident. Now the hooded man has returned in a series of dreams that presage horrors both personal and public: an airline crash, a scary moment during her son's birthday party, a gruesome rape and murder in a subway station. At the same time, Sam is also torn by her husband's increasing dependence on a mysterious Swiss banker. While the ending may not deliver the payoff that readers will expect, overall Samantha's story is satisfactory and pleasingly scary.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The three brave leaders prepare defensive measures to thwart the devious mage Vand, who is empowered by his demonic God, Dobuk.Although grossly outnumbered by Vandâs servitudal mages, ape-likecreatures and Matangan army, mainland spies infiltrate the enemy forces and gain advance knowledge of the planned naval attacks. This Time of Cleansing proves fatal for both sides, as fields are burned, starvation endured and mass casualties result.Even with mages, elves, cat people, giant spiders and a flying dragon to aid in defense, outwitting and overpowering Vand proves more difficult than imagined, especially since heâs guarded by six demons and raises the dead to fight for his dark cause. How then can the prophesized leaders defeat such a powerful enemy?Richard S. Tuttle aptly describes defensive and offensive war strategies in this fantasy tale of good against evil. His characters - mostintroduced in earlier books from this series - hold true to their nobleor deviant convictions to the end. Army of the Dead, although ending the Forgotten Legacy series, is like a new beginning for the author, for Mr. Tuttle can now acquaint his fans with other fantastical tales andtimeless characters.Review by Patricia Spork, Independent Book Reviewer", "related": ["B00G0GXKG4"], "rank": 1398393, "title": "Army of the Dead (Forgotten Legacy #8) eBook", "author": "Richard S.

All the Mowgli stories, and the perennial \"Rikki-tikki-tavi,\" appear to glorious advantage in a handsome format. A manageable size, creamy paper, a clear typeface, and generous margins are as inviting as the 17 masterly full-page watercolors. They are beautifully composed, balanced but not static, freely handled but without any loss of clarity. Mowgli and the animals are characterized rather than idealized. Color and texture are subtle but lush. These contrasts perfectly complement the tension between order and \"the jungle\" evoked in Kipling's text.

Most business owners find the issue difficult to grapple with because it is not just one decision. Rather, in most cases, there are many interrelated decisions to be made. For example: How much money will you receive upon exit? What is the best timing for your exit, given the economic cycle of your country and industry? What kind of advisors will you need? And what will happen to your staff, clients, and business partners?Business Exit Planningexplains the two major phases of leaving a business: Business Exit Planning and Transaction Management (that is, what a business owner needs to know in managing the exit transaction). It will equip you, the business owner, with a full overview of what's involved in exiting your business. The book provides a wealth of illustrative case studies covering the wide range of options available to owners of mid-sized businesses, including intergenerational transfer, merger, liquidation, and more, as well as options for owners who seek an immediate exit and options for those who prefer a staged exit over time.Throughout the book, the author stresses three key themes: 1) A Business Exit should not be a spontaneous process, but the result of careful planning; 2) Business owners tend to underestimate what it takes to exit; and 3) There is often a mismatch in negotiating strength between business owners and professional investors. You may not be able to formulate a definitive opinion on any of those three subjects until you have actually closed at least one transaction. But by reading this book, you will be better preparedâand more successfulâwhen you do start your exit process.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He reports for training at HMS Vincent.He joins the Navy boxing team where he sees success with a string of knockout victories before taking a seemingly un-winnable bout against a local ranked amateur who would later turn professional. Finally ready for shipboard service in January 1963, Pickup joins his first of several ships, the HMS Wakeful, a dilapidated 1945 Destroyer.Travelling the worldâs oceans meant facing powerful storms, on board fires, mechanical breakdowns, the threat of war, and shore leaves where young matelots with money in their pockets and adventure on their minds could get into all sorts of alcohol-infused shenanigans in local establishments.Navy pay, being less than adequate to support a family of four, would see Pickup and his wife running a bed & breakfast and later a fish and chips shop. Pickup worked numerous odd jobs ashore and, during a lengthy station in Gibraltar, operated a booming automotive repair and paint shop.Â Â Â Â Fish and Ships follows a twenty-five year career in the RN that would see Pickup rise to the rank of Chief Petty Officer and retire from service in his early forties to life as the owner of a fish and chips restaurant. Lacking the page-turning action of combat, Alfred Pickup keeps us intrigued and entertained with his quirky humour and attention to detail. There are many laugh out loud scenes in this book that make it a quick and easy read.Fish & Ships offers readers a rare and honest glimpse into the adventure, excitement, and unique challenges of a career in the Royal Navy.I highly recommend it to those who enjoy military memoirs.William R.

Particularly shocking is that the dead man is on his hands and knees, rigor mortis keeping him in position. Monika and her team get to work on the case and soon learn the victim is Andrew Adairâa recently discharged army officer who was one of the paras involved in the notorious 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. Before the team makes much headway, a similar murder occurs, and Monika realizes she must figure out what message the killer is trying to send with the posed corpsesâand fastâbefore the violence escalates. A witty protagonist and a likable supporting cast redeem what is otherwise a formulaic police procedural.(June)Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 2002, she and her family moved to South Carolina where she began to write full time. Her novels are best known for richly describing the settings that surround her characters. Readers feel like they are really there, no matter what era the story takes place in.   Her first novel, Phiandra and Hercules, is a love story about the Ancient Greek Hero with the tormented soul who would like nothing more than to settle down and retire with the beautiful young Phiandra.   Her second novel, Merman's Redemption, is about two people who try to help each other overcome grief and personal tragedy. The setting is a small beach town in Southern Mexico.   Jungle Fates is her third novel, wherein betrayal and heartbreak is finally reconciled between two graduate students who work at an eco-tourism compound in Costa Rica.   Her fourth novel, another Ancient Greek Heroic Romance entitled, Isla and Ajax, is a love story between the second greatest hero of the Trojan War and a young woman banished from home.  Continuing her love of Ancient Greece, she has begun her next story about Alcmene, a woman who gave birth to twins-Hercules, the son of Zeus, and Iphicles, the son of her husband, Amphitryon.  Kelly Ann has also begun to delve into the world of writing screenplays, because there's just never anything good on TV.  She hopes to adapt many of her stories onto the small screen-and maybe the big screen one day (every writer's dream)!

Kelley has been a contributor toAmerican School Board Journalfor many years, and the response his articles receive speak for themselves. This book, which is the culmination of his 40 years experience as a planner, showcases the work of a master at his profession. Using actual case discussions and featuring many checklists, it provides solid, down-to-earth advice on what can be an extremely complicated issue for school board members and administrators.(Glenn Cook, editor-in-chief, American School Board Journal )In today's economy, school district leaders can't afford to ignore this book. Kelley Carey has called upon his 35 years of experience as a consultant in districts of all types and sizes to provide a very informative and useful guide to data-driven planning. His recommended five-year context is right on target as he informs us that 'the key to making smart decisions is comprehensive planning.' This book is definitely being added to the reading list for my doctoral students. (Leonard H. Elovitz, Associate Professor, Department of Educational Leadership, Kean University, New Jersey )In the current climate of financial stress, Kelley Carey'sSchool District Master Planning: A Practical Guide to Demographics and Facilities Planningis a valuable tool that belongs on the shelf of all school administrators. Based on Carey's extensive 35 years of experience consulting as a planner with districts all over the United States, this volume is a how-to from A to Z for educational leaders who are seeking to engage in planning for their districts. While it is always helpful to rely on the actual presence of outside experts such as Carey, his book is the next best thing to his being there in the flesh: he provides a step by step analysis, from inception to development to implementation and follow-up for leaders who wish to engage in master planning for their schools and communities.(Charles J. Russo, Panzer Chair in Education and adjunct professor of law, University of Dayton )Finally!School District Master Planningfills a void that has existed in the urban planning literature for decades. The field of urban planning is dedicated to the proposition that we can build better communities by creating a vision and aligning and guiding public and private development. Although schools often define communities, it is rare that urban planners are engaged or the tools of planners are utilized within the context of K-12 facility planning. Dr. Kelley Carey reminds us of these linkages and provides a guide on how these tools may be used within the context of school facility master planning-producing results, engaging citizens, and building better schools and communities.(Patrick Burke, chief of operations, Fulton County School District, Atlanta, Georgia )School District Master Planning: A Practical Guide to Demographics and Facilities Planningis exactly that: practical. Dr. Kelley Carey explains the complex process of facilities planning with logic and reasoning in a step-by-step approach. His expansive knowledge of planning has been tested in hundreds of school districts over the years in his role as an expert consultant. Dr. Carey's work trained our team to think systematically in a way that reduced emotional responses to highly controversial facilities use and student assignment plans. Kelley Carey's methods and writings have made a profound mark on my thinking, planning, and leadership.(Valerie Truesdale, superintendent, Beaufort County School District, South Carolina, AASA Women In School Leadership Award recipient )", "related": [], "rank": 626393, "title": "School District Master Planning", "author": "Kelley D.

He reads the Rule with a modern eye and opens it up as much for people who live in a community as those living in the world of everyday work. For this reason, these meditations are also suitable for Benedictine secular oblates. A life based on the principles of the Rule of Benedict makes the world a more Christian and more human place.

He left behind no story arcs, no further plot ideas or concepts of where to go next. He'd created a single novella and the concept for a series, but not a series itself.Â Â  Â A decade later, I was commissioned to expand the novella into a full-sized book and then create nine more books, thus turning Smith's idea into what became known as the \"Family d'Aloembert series.\" I'd read and enjoyed Smith's earlier Skylark and Lensman series, so I was eagerly anticipating this assignment.Â Â  Â Unfortunately, it was not all I'd hoed for. The novella certainly had action aplenty, but the writing, the universe and the characters left much to be desired. The text used bizarre words like \"ultratoilsomely.\" The characters were two-dimensional and way too goody-goody even for the 1960s, let alone the 70s or later. The history and development of the universe were painfully naive, with an anti-communhist screed straight out of the McCarthy era of the 50s. And while Smith was noted for the excellence of his villains, the ultimate bad guy here never once set foot onstage. Clearly this work needed a lot of rehabilitation.Â Â  Â Having to stick closely to Smith's creation hampered me considerably, but I did as much as I could to make the characters and universe more believable, and I tried to come up with stories that were exciting enough to please Smith's legion of fans. I got letters of praise that told me I was succeeding, which was most gratifying.Â Â  Â Still, as decades passed, the initially creaky concept grew more and more outdated. Finally, in the mid-2000s, I decided to update the series. I tossed out \"Imperial Stars\" in its entirety; instead, I wrote an entirely new first novel to introduce the universe and the characters, and I made major modifications to the remaining 9 books to fit the new beginning. The result is what I now call the Agents of ISIS series, something I feel is more appropriate for the 21st century.Â Â Â Getaway Worldis book 4 of the classic series, superseded bySanctuary Planetof my Agents of ISIS. Whichever series you choose to read, I hope you enjoy it.--Stephen Goldin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Iris used Jessica's real name and that scared Jessica.  No one is supposed to know it, that was part of their deal. Iris admitted to Jessica that her first call was to the CIA and that worries Jessica because she knows they want Phil Munroe's black book.   When she arrives at the Munroe estate, Detective Sullivan Kincaid is already there. The police also become involved because Iris calls them for help.  For the police, there is no crime, no missing person, no case.  Sully's immediate impression of Jessica is that this beautiful woman is dangerous.  Something about this situation bothers him, so he goes to Munroe's  office and he finds Jessica and Iris there. Jessica tells him lies and half truths, and Sully becomes more suspicious.  He also gives in to his attraction to Jessica and he kisses her.  He feels the gun she has in her bra and now Sully is convinced that there is more to Jessica and this situation than meets the eye.  Phil Munroe's disappearance becomes a certainty and the stakes get higher and more dangerous.  Murder and mayhem happens at the Munroe estate and Sully knows the truth of who killed whom, but he keeps quiet and he takes Iris and Jessica to his home for the night.  Jessica can't give Sully the whole truth, but she wants him to trust her, so she gives him the only thing she can, herself. Sully investigates Jessica and he uncovers the truth about her traumatic childhood.  He confronts her with his knowledge and they share their stories.  With the whole truth out in the open, they argue about Jessica's plan of action to save Phil.  Iris overhears them and runs off to save her father because she can give the kidnappers what they want.  Finding Iris gone, they leap into action. Jessica knows the stakes and she knows how the game will be played so she is calling the shots and Sully is her back up.  The chances of everyone coming out of this safely are slim and they can afford no mistakes.  At the last second, two shots are fired simultaneously, both hitting their marks.  Sully prays for the first time since he was a child, and God willing, all of his prayers will be answered.From the first sentence to the last period, Ms. Dixon had my complete and undivided attention!  Fast moving, dramatic and intense action compliments and equals the passionate and sensual romance!  Debra Dixon is fabulous!  Bad To The Bone is a chilling and riveting story, warmed only by the love it created.  Suspenseful and powerful!  Ms. Dixon's writing is masterful!  I couldn't put this book down!

Wallace, University of Washington\"Several years ago, Professor Andrew Dessler created an introductory course on climate change at Texas A&M; University for freshman and sophomores. This textbook is an outgrowth of the notes he used in teaching that course. Last year while Andy was away I taught the course using his first draft of the book, which was shared online with the students. Both the students and I very much enjoyed the course and the notes. Andy is a natural teacher and writer with such an ease of presentation that he makes complex subjects accessible by his clever use of everyday analogies. Climate change is a subject that Andy cares about passionately, and he really cares about his reader as well. The book provides an expert's exposition of climate change in all its facets, from ice sheets to options for public policy. While it is written primarily as a textbook, it also provides excellent reading for any layperson interested in the subject.\" Professor Gerald R. North, Texas A&M; University\"Professor Dessler's book is written for 'undergraduate non-science majors'.  He must believe in the impossible - that he can bring a topic as complex as climate change into focus for students with little background in science.  However, I must say that Professor Dessler has succeeded! Students who read this book will achieve a level of understanding of climate change that they may, first, \"engage in an informed debate of public policy\"; second, understand the deep significance of Climategate; and third, explain and act upon the recent explosion of public interest in climate change (wide coverage by the media, and huge UN conferences, with more than 20,000 persons attending). To put this in perspective, Lord King, a former scientific advisor to the British Prime Minister, is quoted as saying that 'No single issue, scientific or non-scientific, has ever received as much attention from world leaders as climate change.' Why this upwelling of interest? And how can society profit from it?\" Professor Ted Munn, University of Toronto\"The book reads extremely well: It uses stories, analogues, and examples to draw the reader into the story of the science of our changing planet. Despite the complexity of the actual science, Dessler presents the material in a clear manner and does it without drawing on mathematics any more difficult than simple algebra. ..However, Introduction to Modern Climate Change does a better job than either of those books at getting to the heart of the science and at analyzing the philosophies leading to possible policy options. I recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about climate change and the challenges it presents to humanity.\" - Donald J. Wuebbles, Physics Today, November 2012\" The text provides a readable, concise summary of the science of climate change, but it is the nonscientific aspects of the book that set it apart...Overall, I think this is a well-crafted textbook. The writing is very accessible without being too simplistic. The combination of a broad overview of the science and policy of climate change is both novel and appropriate for the intended audience: an introductory-level survey course on climate change. Reading the book was a learning experience for me, and I would happily recommend this book to anyone seeking an introduction to climate change.\" -Guillaume Mauger, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society", "related": ["B002IKKHXU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Let it be said that Borowitz's writing is no less charismatic for embracing some pretty obvious opportunities for laughs.) In the end, it seems, his brush with death from the inside out proved an ambiguous blessing: the author suffered the accompanying discomfort, pain, and fear; readers reap the rewards of his levity aplenty. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00F8GP5O2"], "rank": 71609, "title": "An Unexpected Twist (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Andy Borowitz", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 53, "rating_average": 4.2075, "rating_total": 223.0}

A modest but growing number of historians dispute this view, particularly the notion of U.S. detachment. BÃ¶nker is one of those and presents undeniable evidence that the US was anything but aloof. This evidence comes from the planners and strategists themselves, whom BÃ¶nker quotes heavily. . . . The parallels are striking; at times, the US desire for worldwide dominance surpasses the aims of Imperial Germany.\"âChoice(October 2012)\"BÃ¶nker's study expands significantly on recent work that interprets the kaiser's navy in a nonexceptionalist framework, stressing global dynamics rather than the peculiarities of modern Germany: thekaiserreichwas not a unique case; its navy was not the expression of special conditions, as Eckart Kehr, Volker R. Berghahn, and Hans-Ulrich Wehler had argued. However, BÃ¶nker does not overstretch this interpretation. His study is far too much informed by meticulous archival research and an awareness of the specific historical contexts on both sides of the Atlantic for him to embrace the revisionist interpretation wholeheartedly.\"âAmerican Historical Review\"Militarism in a Global Ageis ambitious and original, entirely successful in its comparative purpose, and intensively grounded in the fullest of archival research. Dirk BÃ¶nker makes a decisive contribution to both German and U.S. history, situating the resulting synthesis in the context of transnational and global history. This book will have a major impact.\"âGeoff Eley, Karl Pohrt Distinguished University Professor of Contemporary History, University of Michigan, author ofThe Future of Class in History\"This terrific book displays Dirk BÃ¶nker's intellectual range and acuity. Threaded through the book is a persuasive argument that German and American navalism were foundational to state-building in both countries and that it had a highly racialist and gendered basisâhis material on how the U.S. Navy squeezed out nonnatives and nonwhites is stunning. This is international history at its best.\"âMichael Sherry, Richard W.

After being publicly crucified, the policeman puts a bullet through his head and dies unmourned. But then an eyewitness confides in Gunner that he saw the kid shoot twice before the cop fired and asks the PI to investigate. In need of a client, Gunner reluctantly takes the volatile case. He finds the gun (a dummy that shoots blanks) and a Latina policewoman willing to listen to this discomfiting new evidence. Barely pausing for narrative breath, the author adds intriguing elements to his plot: the eyewitness isn't a thoroughly convincing player; his brother is beaten up; another kid involved in the robbery is tight-lipped; the dead boy's uncle is a gambler with big debts; and most people in the black community are ready to let this possible injustice pass, believing a larger justice has been served by the cop's death. Gunner is a rarity in recent detective fiction: soured, yet utterly believable, tough and resourceful without being cartoonishly overblown. This pulsating mystery strengthens an already forceful series.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Doug's\nbook is a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. The camera\ncompany should be employing Doug to write their cameras manuals!-Robert D.A Pro Right There with You- If you want to get the camera\nup and running with the feeling of a pro right there with you then I would\nstrongly recommend it. He walks you through setting the camera up and gives you\nhis reasoning for the settings. He leaves the door open to change them based on\nyour level of experience. After the basic settings tour Doug then gets down to\nthe heart of this great camera: the custom settings and focus system. His\nexplanation is first class and he explains how various custom settings are\nrelated to each other. The focus system on this camera is top drawer and Doug\ndoes a fine job explaining what can be a very intimidating area of this camera.\nAll in all a great read.Â  Camera in one hand and reader in the other and\ndig in.-Tim S.A Must-Have Accessory- What a great addition to my bag.\nThis is a well written, full body of work that explains, in plain English, how\nto get the most out my new camera.

Examples include the New York School poet Barbara Guest, the Anglo-American poet Denise Levertov and the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet Susan Howe.

His parents, converts to a Calvinistic sect, led an austere life, ill-suited to their dreamy and sensitive son. During adolescence, he became fascinated by hypnotism and the supernatural and, on leaving university, studied Hindu philosophy and occultism. Later, he was to draw on these beliefs and experiences in his writing. Sent away to Canada at the age of twenty, his attempts at making a living were wholly unsuccessful and shortly after his return to England, he began to write. The Empty House and Other Ghost Stories, published in 1906, was followed by a series of psychic detective stories, featuring John Silence, 'physician extraordinary'. His reputation as one of the greatest exponents of supernatural fiction began to grow. Chiefly known for his ghost stories, Blackwood wrote in many different forms within the genre. His most personal works, however, are his 'mystical' novels, for example The Centaur, where he explores man's empathy with the forces of the universe. Blackwood also wrote children's fiction. A Prisoner in Fairyland was adapted into the play (later the musical), Starlight Express. Later in life, Blackwood turned to writing radio plays, and in 1947 he began a new career on BBC TV telling ghost stories. He received a knighthood in 1949.", "related": ["B0082XRFBO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Throughout, the mechatronic approach â a synergistic integration of the components â is maintained, in keeping with contemporary practice.The authorsâ holistic approach does not preclude the reader from learning in a step-by-step fashion â each chapter contains material that can be studied separately without compromising understanding. Drives are described in several chapters organized according to the way they are usually classified in industry, each comprised of its actuators and sensors. The controller is discussed alongside. Topics of recent and current interest â piezoelectricity, digital communications and future trends â are detailed in their own dedicated chapters.Drives and Control for Industrial Automationis primarily written for engineers and researchers interested in the applications of sensors, actuators and control systems in the automated environment. The discussion is thorough with the basics laid out succinctly but in sufficient detail to be useful to non-expert readers so students will also find this monograph a profitable source of information.", "related": [], "rank": 3205399, "title": "Andi Sudjana Putra", "author": "Kok Kiong Tan", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Erica J. Peters demonstrates, with both intellectual elegance and a deeply rooted sense of food, how culinary choices are a marker of historical change. Using a diverse array of sources, she goes against the grain to explore everyday life in Vietnam in the long nineteenth century, affording a penetrating insight into what Vietnamese people wanted to be in a time of economic struggle and colonialism, and into how ordinary people experienced habitus and change, adaptation and contestation, even creativity.Appetites and Aspirations in Vietnamis a gourmet meal that leaves the reader satisfiedâ¦. The wide range of narratives of food Peters explores â¦ sheds new light on disparities of gender, ethnicity, and wealth. Food may have been a tool of imperialism; it certainly became a tool of nationalism in modern Vietnam. Nobody would have expected the history of a âfusion cuisineâ would tell as much.(Laurence Monnais, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al)A reviewer of the wide-rangingAppetites and Aspirationscould evaluate this rich study along any number of axes: economic history, the history of imperial and colonial Vietnam, or the history of race and ethnicity, to name a few. Nonetheless, food is most emphatically Petersâs preferred ground and where she anchors her argument that French and Vietnamese used diet to shape radically divergent identities in colonial Indochinaâ¦.It would be unfair to expect a study so ambitious to succeed equally well on so many frontsâ¦.Nonetheless, this fascinating and suggestive narrative of nineteenth-century imperial and colonial Vietnam will appeal to a wide range of general readers and specialists.(H-France)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maltese\nculinary traditions are unlike any other because they incorporate the island's\nlocal flavors with Italian and Arabic cooking methods and recipes. This is not\nthe place to visit if you plan to diet, so make room for the pastas, stews,\ncheeses and risottos that you've been dreaming of. Maltese wines, although not\nas well known in Europe, are also savory and masterfully created. Check out the\nisland's pride, Meridiana Wine Estate, and sample their famous Isis Chardonnay.\nIf I had to choose one restaurant from this guide that you cannot miss, it\nwould be Rebekah's in Mellieha. I dined there for dinner one night and it was\none of the tastiest meals I have had in my life.Â I have not\nyet gotten my SCUBA certification, but I know that Malta has fantastic dive\nsites for those visitors that are certified. All three Maltese islands feature\ncrystal clear blue water ideal for maximum visibility. At the moment there are\n7 popular wreck sites around the Maltese islands. Check them out at visitmalta.com.When you're\ntouring the different cities, towns and villages of Malta, you will notice that\neach has its own, distinctive Coat of Arms, which is a tradition brought over\nby the Knights of St. John. As a travel project, take pictures of each one you\nfind. They are proudly displayed on parking meters, sewer caps and in other\ninconspicuous places around the island. You will be surprised at how many there\nare.Be sure to\ndouble-check the bus schedules. Bus services run from 5:30 am to 11:00 pm with\nnight buses only in select areas. The buses get packed on weekends, so plan to\nwait in line during high tourist season, especially at the Valletta stop if you\nare heading to the St. Julian's/ Silema area for dinner. Last, but not least,\nremember to reserve your admission to the Hypogeum well in advance. The waiting\ntime can be months and it is man made wonder that would be a shame to miss.Malta is so\nmuch more than sand, sun and sea. After just one visit, you'll be in awe of\nthis little island and all the charm and wonder it holds. The hospitality,\nworld-class cuisine and intriguing culture are all there, so why aren't you?David Hoffmann, Davidsbeenhere.com", "related": ["B0079M54XA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It has become her tradition to celebrate the season of giving with an original short story for her loved ones. Each one is an allegory that represents a concept she has learned or problem she has struggled with during the year. The catalyst came when Audrey began telling oral stories. Soon, she realized that storytelling was a big part of her past with bedtime stories of Dumbo told by Uncle Doc and Grandpap stories told by Dad. As a parent, she told improvised stories to her boys with their teddy bears, not even remembering that her Uncle used to do for her as well. Oddly enough, it was this new found passion of storytelling âfinding herâ that encouraged her to actually begin publishing the stories that she had written over the years. âOnce Upon a Storytime at Christmasâ is the compilation of Christmas stories that she traditionally writes each year during the Holidays, so look for more stories to come. The books, video and audio recordings of these stories are available on her website and Amazon.com. Events with these stories and more can be scheduled by contacting Audrey at: www.profundities.net www.onceuponastorytime.net www.facebook.com/audreyleestoryteller", "related": [], "rank": 2920789, "title": "Once Upon a Storytime at Christmas - The Stone Cottage", "author": "Audrey Lee", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

It is more than I expected. The story is about survivors of a global\npandemic but the readers quickly come to realize there is more to this\nplague than just a bad flu strain. The disease is caused by an outbreak\nof nanobots, and they are somehow interacting strangely with the world.From SmashwordsReview by: Lashonda LeeksThe\n introduction peeked my interest but I must say the violent second\nchapter almost made me pass up on this story. Almost. I had to know\nwhere the author was taking the book and what would happen with the\nthree young people he takes responsibility for. The story, despite the\nbeginning violence turns out to be a very uplifting work. That's not to\nsay the violence ends with the second chapter. McDonald has created a\nbelievable aftermath situation and in a nation without a social\ninfrastructure you would expect there to be anarchists around and there\nare. A group called The Saints show up and Jake and the three siblings\nare their prime targets. The author states there is a definite line\ndrawn between right and wrong and does fulfill that promise. I'll give\nit a five star rating because I couldn't put it down until I finished\nit.Five StarsVERY VERY GOOD READB.

I left the navy\nin 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I\nstarted and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to\nAntigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we\nmanage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in\nParadise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I\nwas 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by\nthen so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole\nfamily fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email atÂ chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bart Lasiter is a barely-scraping-by private investigator, formerly associated with the Berkeley Police Department, currently working out of a low-rent, cramped office/studio in Old Sacramento. In this novelette Lasiter is approached by the better-than-perfect TV newscaster, Marti Planker, to assist her in bringing closure to a string of antique store burglaries popularly believed to be committed by a ghost. Of course, it was Marti Planker who has pushed the \"ghost\" angle on-air, and she wants to get credit for solving the crime spree, since the police can't seem to do it. She offers Lasiter $300 of her own money to track down the \"ghost\" for her, all the while insinuating there may be some more personal bonuses for Lasiter if he takes the case. Lasiter owes everybody money, so he takes the case, even though he knows better than to believe in ghosts. So who is burglarizing the antique stores, if it is not a ghost? Why do so many witnesses describe the culprit as being a ghost? Will Marti come through with her promise to give all the glory and fame to Lasiter, once the case is solved?Â  . . . .If you enjoy private eye tales, particularly of shorter duration, you will love \"Bad News for a Ghost\". It truly is a pleasurable read. As an added bonus, the author includes a short story, 'Bart's First Arrest', at the end of the book.

The two car garage, white picket fence and 2.5 kids was his lifeâs dream. Due to some twists of fate his life changed suddenly and a different path was taken. At this time,he began to question everything he was brought up to believe, his political views, his religious and spiritual beliefs and every value society places on us as members of the human race. During his Vision Quest, which lead him to Egypt, Australia, the Canary Islands, Belize and most of the United States, he reevaluated and examined everything he believed in. Having always had an interest in things of a spiritual and esoteric nature this was without question  a predetermined path. Through and because of his interest in photography he was able to study and document many ancient cultures throughout the world, in particular the Australian Aborigine, the Maya, and the Ancient Egyptians. Although his travels have changed his perception of life and many of the spiritual values he once held, one belief remains unchanged. His belief in the basic conservative core values of life that have been carried down through the ages from time immemorial.His belief in a Supreme Being or God have not faltered. Time and time again history has shown that when a people or civilization fall from a belief in their God and basic common sense values , their way of life ceases to be. Letâs not let that happen to us. To contact Gary: www.journeysthrulife.com.

An unusual lesson indeed for a respectable woman of the court, but Blanchard is no ordinary lady in waiting.  She does have the proper antecedents for her place, but an eye and an ear for suspicious dealings helps her to earn additional income. She is a spy, paid to seek out traitorous deeds. InThe Doublet Affair, Lord Burleigh sends her to watch some erstwhile friends whose dealings have become more suspicious than keeping the odd Catholic priest under their roof. The plot is enriched by Ursula's own ambivalence about her role: not only does she have a fondness for the family under suspicion, she longs to leave court entirely to join her French husband.The central mystery is an appropriate one for the period. There are the usual mysterious deaths as well as hints of treachery against the crown. Indeed, one of Fiona Buckley's strengths is her historical appreciation for the fact that Elizabeth, despite her longevity, was never completely secure on the throne; Catholic plots and other schemes of usurpation abounded. Buckley's weakness is her certainty (and Ursula's) that Elizabeth was gentler in religious persecution than her sister. Regardless, Buckley's imaginative sense of quotidian life in Elizabethan England is delightful, and the mystery reaches a satisfying conclusion--with Ursula's lock picks put to good use.Fiona Buckley is a pseudonym for an established author venturing into historical whodunits.The Doublet Affairfollows her first effort,To Shield the Queen.--K.

Graves Growing up in Virginia, the pastoral hills of Albemarle County sparked an inner yearning for adventure in me. Playgrounds like the Shenandoah National Park, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay added to my adventurous side. I heard that whisper all explorers must hear from the gentle wind, or the surf on the beach, which is the call to see over the next mountain range, across the horizon on the ocean and around the next bend in the road. My appreciation for nature, animals, wilderness, and the incredible bio diversity of planet Earth, also sparked a creative passion for photography and writing. Yearning for adventure lead me to Scuba diving in the early 1990's and  over the next decade my Scuba travels took me back to the Bahamas many times and also to the Galapagos Islands, Honduras, Turks & Caicos, Bahamas, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, and the Florida Keys.  C. Joseph Elder High adventure is my choice for the books that I read, the movies that I watch and the world in which I live. Though not quite as adventurous as my favorite characters, I have traveled to many faraway places and have had my own list of great adventures. I've searched and found rare antiques: some of my finds are on display in museums in England and in the United States. As a scuba diver, I have dived in foreign waters and very unique places. I've even had the opportunity to work on underwater archaeology projects on historic shipwrecks off the coast of England. In fact, the idea for the EcoExplorers was developed with Allen as we returned from a trip wreck diving.  We also dove the walls at Andros and the blue holes that appear in this novel. As a profession, I own Skipjack Nautical Wares & Marine Gallery with my wife Alison, located on the waterfront in our adopted hometown of historic Portsmouth, Virginia.", "related": ["B008MNWS1G"], "rank": 1348214, "title": "The Legend of Hornigold's Treasure ((EcoExplorers Action Adventure Series Book1) - Young Adult Teen Fiction Scuba Diving Bahamas Pirate Treasure Hunt Romance) eBook", "author": "C.

Iâm Markus Fredericks. My two main goals are: (1) to entertain the world, and (2) to change the world.  PROJECT GENESIS was inspired by the â100 year forecastâ of the world which I wrote about in my first book, âBlueprints For A Better Worldâ, a non-fiction book aimed at improving the quality of life for all Mankind.        I am also a UFO believer and enthusiast. I am appalled at the governmentâs continued efforts to suppress the truth about UFOs and extraterrestrials. I vow to have the Top Secret UFO files opened to the public. I met a UFO and ET expert, Bob De Long. Our friendship flourished and we co-authored a series of science fiction books called, âNatalieeâs Alien Nightmareâ. It combines Bobâs alien expertise with my wildly imaginative, writing style. My motto is, âIf a reader is willing to spend his/her time reading my book(s), I will make âdarn sureâ that he/she is thoroughly entertained and ecducated â at a bare minimum.â Thank you.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having studied alternative health paradigms and procedures for many years  Joshua is always searching for information that he can be share with individuals who are  interested in improving as well as maintaining their health. He has implemented many of  these lifestyle changes in his personal life and has shared them with others who are on a  mission to improve their health. Joshua writes with passion in an effort to help others obtain optimal health.  His work is informative, sometimes controversial, and always beneficial for anyone seeking to improve  their current health status.  Over the years Joshua has obtained extensive knowledge in  the fields of nutrition, exercise and the mind-body connection.  He believes in viewing  and treating the body as a whole and not as individual parts or symptom complexes as the  standard medical practitioners often do. In an effort to help people move forward with  their health he understands we must look at each personâs health picture uniquely. Joshua  knows that an individualâs genetics, biochemistry, and psychological makeup all contribute to their overall health status. Complicating matters at times is the fact that an   individual's lifestyle choices in addition to environmental factors can and will have a  huge impact on their health potential. Joshua is a proponent of a holistic medical approach that focuses on identifying the root   causes of malfunction in the body rather than treating and trying to control symptoms. He   fully understand that you must first understand the origins of chronic disease prior to  developing a meaningful treatment and preventive program. His vision is to help others improve their health by providing innovative, state of the  art, health tips and information.  He hopes to encourage you to make lifestyle changes  that will both restore your health and ultimately help to prevent the onset of   debilitating and life-threatening chronic diseases.", "related": [], "rank": 857006, "title": "Wheat Free Diet: Lose the belly fat weight loss plan and wheat free recipe cookbook.

My reasoning with my spouse holds true with my fans:\nWarnyck is so cool that I had to reinvent Loric to make him a viable lead. With\nthat in mind, and being stubborn, I began working on A Wayward Light. I\nsoon convinced my wife that the chief scout is every bit the adventurer that\nLoric is. In fact, she liked his tale better than the first three novels of the\nseries.With this character change established, I will relate that The Sons\nof Donigan concludes the first trilogy of the series, and A Wayward\nLight now begins the second trilogy, which I refer to as the bridge\ntrilogy. The story of the Dragon Eyes has split in three directions, with a\nworthy character to follow through each part. It begins with Warnyck, who must\nfind and cure Evelyn of the terrible curse upon her. Spoiler alert, as if it is\na surprise, the next part of the bridge is The Basher of Belgandost,\nwhich follows Barag, in Beledon, as he defends it from minions of the\nDragon-Queen. I will not give away the next title, but it returns the action to\nthe Dragon Eyes, himself, Loric, who is heading to Regalsturn with Avalana and\nAldric.Readers may notice\nthat I have not included maps of other lands Warnyck enters and explores. I\nhave sketched maps. I considered retooling them for this release. Then I\nreconsidered doing so. Maps of these other regions are non-essential to\nunderstanding the path Warnyck takes to the action of this novel, so I only\nincluded the standard Map of Beledon, which is the focal land of this series. I\nextend my deepest apologies to all lovers of cartography, in advance. I trust\nyou will thoroughly enjoy A Wayward Light without these extra maps. In\nfact, I am counting on it.

Brandi, a cheerleader, starts dating an older football player who tries to pressure her to have sex before she is ready. Marisa, a twirler, is dismayed to discover that not only does her class schedule keep her from seeing her friends, but she also has many classes with Brandi's ex-boyfriend. Predictably, they share an illicit kiss, putting her friendship with Brandi at risk. In the meantime, Shane, the photographer for the school newspaper, decides to turn over a new leaf and stop smoking pot, trying to earn back her family's trust. When the pressure becomes too much, she turns to a friend outside of their group and becomes addicted to Adderall. Besides the various clichÃ©d plot points, the sheer number of characters and story lines is likely to confuse readers. The perspective shifts among the girls' points of view and an omniscient narrator throughout the novel. The language tries a bit too hard to win over teen readers (\"Christmas break was on and popping\"). Freeman also spends too much time explaining how the characters feel. An additional choice for readers who like drama with an ending tied up neatly in a bow.âLindsay Klemas, JM Rapport School for Career Development, Bronx, NY", "related": [], "rank": 2964811, "title": "High School High (Port City High)", "author": "Shannon Freeman", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is known throughout the world for his innovative synthesis of dreams and bodywork that integrates Jungian therapy and group process, with studies of consciousness, Taoism, shamanism, quantum physics, and conflict resolution. In the 1970s, Mindell began to develop Processwork, also known as process-oriented psychology. Â His work has given rise to a new paradigm with applications in a diversity of areas including individual psychotherapy, personal meditation practice, medicine (including coma and near-death experiences), large group and change management processes, and environmental issues. Dr. Mindell travels widely in the US and abroad with his partner and coresearcher, Dr. Amy Mindell, holding workshops, seminars, and making frequent appearances at professional conferences and on television and radio shows.

The contemporary context frames the narrative and illustrates the enduring utility of academics in developing military strategy. . . . In a useful corrective to the reflexive view of a left-leaning ivory tower, Rohde offers stimulating insight into the complicated lives and ideological persuasions at play. And in an age when research funding has never seemed more important to academics' career prospects,Armed With Expertiseoffers a historical lesson worth heeding.\"âMichael Patrick Cullinane,Times Higher Education Supplement(5 December 2013)\"Rohde makes a significant, highly readable, relevant contribution to understanding the relationship between social science expertise and the US national security state. . . . Recent authorized and unauthorized revelations about the domestic and foreign programs of the National Security Agency, the role of psychologists during the interrogation of suspects, and the roles of the Defense and State Departments in the war on terror suggest that Rohde's work has much to say to Americans today. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\"âChoice(1 February 2014)\"This accomplished and important book shows how the social sciences became enmeshed in a militarized system which has persisted, even grown, in recent years even as it moved off campus, making it less visible and therefore less controversial. Joy Rohde offers especially striking and disturbing material on the blowback of social science collaboration with the armed forces, as individuals and institutions moved beyond addressing threats abroad into assessing domestic disorder and attempting to control it.\"âMichael Sherry, Richard W. Leopold Professor of History, Northwestern University, author ofIn the Shadow of War: The United States since the 1930s\"Armed with Expertiseis a very fine book about Cold War social science, the relationship of academic institutions to the national security state, and the emphatic militarization of knowledge production during the past half century. Joy Rohde persuasively demonstrates that efforts to safeguard academic freedom by exiling military research from university campuses during and after the Vietnam War had unintended and deeply paradoxical consequences that are still with us. The military's hold on social research was strengthened, its production was privatized, and it was insulated from the public debate on which democracy depends. Rohde's narrative is sobering and consequential for anyone who cares about the relationship between knowledge and politics in the United States and the world.\"âEllen Herman, University of Oregon, author ofThe Romance of American Psychology: Political Culture in the Age of Experts\"InArmed with Expertise, Joy Rohde analyzes a pivotal debate over expert knowledge and democracy in the context of the Cold War. As she convincingly argues, the attack on university-centered, state-sponsored social research produced powerful, unintended consequences. Rohde's writing is clear and direct, and this impressive book will appeal to a broad range of scholars interested in the histories of social science, the Cold War, public policy, and education. Rohde also raises compelling questions about the relationship between academia, intelligence, and national security in our own time.\"âMichael E.

He and\nJanice and their adopted daughter, Reyna, braved a winter in the cabin in the\nmiddle nineties. They learned various survival skillsÂ Â Â  Those long dark winter nights were a good\ntime to reflect on the things of God.

Inspired\nby the great authors that write fiction depicted at the end of time, David has\ncaptured this same spirit but in the culture and life of Alaska.

My passion for writing stretches longer than my memory does. I vaguely recall sitting in my living room as a child of around four years old, writing a story about a petulant kid who would answer all of his parents' demands with \"if I have to.\" It has yet to win the Pulitzer prize, but at least it amused my family. As I grew older, my subject matter ranged from talking bears with a thirst for adventure to ghost stories, fueled by my childhood love of 'Goosebumps' books and my own overactive imagination. I have always been an avid reader, and my own stories have been inspired by everything from the classics to contemporary cult fiction. In 2010 I was lucky enough to be granted a place to study at Cambridge University, a place steeped in history and expectation. It was after my second year here that I began work on my debut novel, Angel, loosely based on some of my own experiences in Cambridge along with my constant urge to wonder 'what if...' Angel was released in 2013 and is currently available in both eBook and paperback formats. As I grow older and leave university, it is my hope that I will be lucky enough to continue writing, as there are so many more themes I want to explore. My stories are driven by real life problems, youth culture and sexuality. I am a keen follower of pop culture and this also plays a big part in my writing. Ever since I was a teenager, I found pop music was able to express my own feelings in much more clarity than I could ever hope for. Music and literature are my two biggest passions, and I believe they are intrinsically linked. Aside from this, I am deeply passionate about worldwide LGBT rights and the protection of animals - both big and small. I have a blog which can be found at www.alexnorrisbooks.com as well as a Facebook page - please do give me a like if you've enjoyed my work!

It never occurred to her that she wanted a career as an author until she began writing, as therapy to get perspective on a crucial part of her life. Melinda was a professional target shooter for a decade, winning multiple National Championships. She was breaking records in her teens until health issues forced her to give up the sport. Out of that heartbreak, Rendezvous with Hymera started taking shape and so began her career as a Romantic Suspense author. Melinda has always been a fan of writers like Diana Gabaldon, Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown. Currently she weaves romance into tales laced with the paranormal and occult. Her interests in yoga, philosophy and a large range of other disciplines give her work depth and color.

Jesse falls in love with Amanda as well, but he also\nfalls in love with Amanda's quiet corner of eternity and decides to settle down\nand be happy for a change.Â That is until one night when Amanda is bitten by a\nraccoon and must travel with Jesse to the present for the life-saving rabies\nvaccine. She promises Jesse that she will return to 1878 just as soon as her\ntreatment is finished.Â Sure she is. You are not going to have an oppressed\nmill worker from 1878 visit 2014, land of cars, cellphones, and women's rights,\nand think for a second that she's going to turn around and go back to her old\nlife of mill-dust and outhouses. Amanda is finally enjoying life, she's\nlearning plenty, and she is growing stronger by the day.Â But, lovers or not, peopleÂ shouldn'tÂ live in other\npeople's centuries. Jesse's lustful feelings vs. Amanda's Victorian morals is\nquite a problem. So is Amanda's culture shock vs. herÂ newÂ consumer power. So\nare the complications that arise over deciding which century to settle down in.\nBut Amanda's biggest challenge may be the crazed opportunist who wants in on\ntheir time-travel action and ultimately threatens the life of Amanda's dearest\nfriend. Now comes the true test of her new-found mettle.", "related": ["B00IM1TT24"], "rank": 1779352, "title": "Perhaps Another Time", "author": "Maggie Maloney", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 22.0}

Keiffer reflects that she courted success from a young age. A move to California provides her the perfect opportunity to pursue new dreams, all with the support of her husband, Larry, and son, John. There, she shapes an impressive career with an advertising agency out of her natural gift with words. The position, for a long stretch, is a fulfilling and validating endeavor. But Keiffer s neat world collapses one day when she finds herself unable to do so much as identify the coinage in her hands. Finally unable to ignore the protestations of her rebelling body, she s forced to leave work indefinitely and confront a terrifying reality: she s suffering from crippling depression. I felt frayed and worn like a bad lamp cord, she writes, waiting helplessly [to] burst into flame.  When discussing the implications of her disease, Keiffer is an unflinching wordsmith. From the outset, she makes it clear that surviving her darkest days came only through recognizing them as an opportunity. They were an outwardly lifeless cave into which she was lowered against her will, she reflects in one particularly powerful passage, but once she was able to look around carefully, she found that said cavern was adorned with metaphorical jewels. When I am deadened with depression, I will move within my own breath ... peel the world in an orange, pebbled glob, bite of zest, in a poem that foreshadows her eventual regeneration. Keiffer speaks of both the disease and recovery as physically painful and painstaking endeavors; the tactile, raw metaphors she uses throughout help to illuminate that journey. Those reading her book to understand battles with mental illness are likely to appreciate her candor, and the continual promise of a hopeful turn is sustaining. Blest by the Dark Angel also examines how social and medical institutions work against facilitating mental well-being. She recalls the deficiencies of an impersonal HMO, the implications of rendering mental illness taboo, the failings of an assigned therapist who refused to see past her bravado, and the misfortune of close friends and coworkers being unable to read the signs of deep depression. Thus, Keiffer s pages also contain the bones of an assignment for the rest of us: that we be officious in securing a more open public space for addressing psychological troubles, all while engaging in the kind of self-conscious being that might have prevented her own collapse in the first place. On such topics, Keiffer is compelling. An emotionally naked and starkly beautiful examination of depression, Blest by the Dark Angel is both an introspective personal account of collapse and recovery and a manual for necessary self-care. --Michelle Anne Schingler Foreword Review: I have never read a more profoundly accurate description of how depression feels. Everything I've ever wanted to say about how depression feels, author Ann Keiffer has expressed in \"Blest By the Dark Angel.\" It is an absolutely exquisite book, and she does so well in explaining how depression, and the physical and emotional symptoms of it, plagued her. I appreciated that she didn't preach to the reader, or say \"here is what you need to do to be happy.\" She simply shares her experience--into depression, through it, and beyond it. The images and poems from her depression awareness project with her son were raw and beautiful. I absolutely loved this book, and have highlights for future reference throughout my Nook copy. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone with depression, and to anyone who loves someone with depression. It is so difficult for one to express truly how awful and debilitating depression can be, but Ann does it so aptly, and I'm so grateful she has shared her story. --Jennifer Orvin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well-written, with the feel of a much longer read, Ash and Bone is a must read for lovers of all things \"a little scary and unexplainable.\"--Tome TenderThis is the third book that I have read by Lisa von Biela and her range\nof writing is very impressive. \"The Genesis Code\" was a fast-paced\nthriller that was smartly written and exciting. \"The Janus Legacy\" was a\n more reflective story that took a look at the core of humanity. In \"Ash\n and Bone,\" von Biela returns to some of the same themes of \"the Janus\nLegacy\" to craft a dark and atmospheric tale of the evil in men...\"Ash and\n Bone\" is a very strong novella that plays on the theme of a haunted\nmotel but is so much more... Ash\nand Bone\" is a complicated story that von Biela has managed to condense\ninto a short novella. It is a tale that packs a powerful punch and is\nmore haunting for its humanity than it is for the ghosts that inhabit\nits pages.--Josef Hernandez, ExaminerLisa changes things up a bit compared to her first two DarkFuse releases\n with a spooky novella that I really enjoyed. Extremely fast paced with\nwonderful characters and a very foreboding mood, exceptionally done!!--Peter SchwotzerThis is the perfect story to read on a dark cold night...an edge-of-your-seat atmosphere without graphic, overly detailed violence.Â  A horror story and mystery combined offer the perfect thrill.Â  This one is an A+.--Suspense Magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 21, "rating_average": 3.4762, "rating_total": 73.0}
