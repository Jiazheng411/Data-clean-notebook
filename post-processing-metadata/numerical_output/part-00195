Like the year before and year after it, however, all of us who experienced it as young adults remember it as a significant time, both in our personal lives and the life of our nation.But memories, as I know only too well, tend to be tricky ... backfilling as the years go by... erasing the individual who really stood there, replacing him with a younger but just as sophisticated version of the person doing the remembering.Fortunately or unfortunately, I wrote it all down the year I was discharged from the service, before it all was lost. The 1969 section of that manuscript, the part that had been missing for years, was discovered in an old box this past January as my wife and I braced for a hurricane hours away from the small South Pacific island on which we live.As the hurricane hit and the power failed, I read it by kerosene lamp, utterly amazed at how naive,unsophisticated, opinionated,cocksure, frightened, foolish, and, yes, joyful, I really was back then.History can be very embarrassing, but it has a value and significance all its own, particularly for a parent trying to understand his own children's outlooks and issues as they cope with their late teens and early young adulthood.My loved ones, the people who brought me up, died much too early in my life to allow me to ever get an up close and personal feel for the times in which they lived and their struggle as young people to make some sense of them.By contrast, Crossroads is a fact and detail-rich account of the way it was,in the Year of Our Lord 1969, when young John Cassell, always amodel of responsibility and ambition, yet inevitably both hobbled and advantaged by the realities of his childhood, stands at the brink ofgraduation from the college he has struggled so hard to get to, and get through.Yet as those who `were there' well remember, this was a time of great turbulence for America and the world. A combination of movements and events which had been building for decades came together from 1967 onward to send this nation as close to the brink of all out revolution as it would ever get, and plunged the younger generation, my generation, into an all out war with its elders and their values.Though about as straight-laced and suspicious of mass movements and those who exploit them as one could be, John shares in many, and experiences all, of the ideas and circumstances that catapults his generation onto an entirely different road. He finds himself having some decisions to make, decisions no longer guided by the old imperatives.This is the story of that year, and those decisions. That our generation has, in the intervening years, become so stodgy and anxious to forget those times, and so acquiescent in bringing about today's government-controlled society, is but a testament to just how wild and upside down things really were for those brief moments in our history.It is to those moments, and those that shared and shaped them with me, that this book is humbly dedicated.John W.

Hope and superstition are the hallmarks of their doggedly loyal fans. During the season, Danny's life is dictated by a complex web of superstitions that dictate how and where he'll watch the games (always avoiding the wrong side of the sofa), what he'll wear, and what he'll eat (two hot dogs, though the toppings vary by circumstance: a rookie pitcher calls for extra onions, for example). Haven's first novel will delight readers with its whimsically exaggerated detail as he simultaneously celebrates and winks a knowing eye at baseball's cherished folklore and superstitions. The intricate plot, which begins with the curse of the poisoned pretzel, will keep readers on the edge of their seats right up to the glorious finale set during baseball's fall classic. Mysteriously odd characters disappear and reappear. Danny, his friends, and the Sluggers themselves are lovable underdogs, comically earnest, and recognizable to baseball fans everywhere. Haven's quirky style with an eye for oddball detail and comic hyperbole will remind readers of Roald Dahl and Eva Ibbotson.Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stevie's parents arrange for him to go to what they think is a computer camp, but when he gets there, he discovers that \"Viper\"is not the name of a software program. It's a snake camp, where kids get to handle snakes and learn all about them. And Stevie is terrified of snakes. He's clever enough to hide his fear and lie his way out of direct confrontation, until he finds a pet snake he loves and overcomes his fear. The plot is decidedly contrived in this chapter book in the Road to Reading series, but the hissing, slimy, scaly stuff is fun, and the cartoon illustrations exaggerate the shudders. Many kids will recognize the common terror that camp might turn out to be a nightmare. They will also enjoy seeing a boy overcome his worst fear and find a pet.Hazel RochmanCopyright © American Library Association.

Lewis, a professor of mechanical engineering, has undertaken the ambitious feat of showing how science and engineering synergized over time to produce today’s technologically advanced world. He supports this premise by surveying such wide-ranging topics as medieval cathedral construction, Leonardo’s notebooks and the building of a Boeing 777. Throughout, he makes astute connections between the past and the present, noting, for example, that the medieval cathedral builders’ \"habits of mind and processes of design formed the foundation that would later coalesce through the advances of the Renaissance, Scientific Revolution, and Industrial Revolution to create the engineering of today.\" Line drawings and diagrams illustrate this connection. The book can be long winded and the prose awkward, particularly when Lewis moves away from the scientific realm and tries his hand at travel writing. Many chapters start with a heavy-handed statement, such as \"The towering tones of the brass rising above the orchestra and organ in the great fugue that is the finale of the Saint-Saens third symphony always transplant my thoughts to the first trip that my wife and I made to France many years ago, and to where we first experienced the grandeur of medieval engineering.\" This turgid writing detracts from an otherwise informative look at science and engineering through the ages.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on 30 years’ experience as an educator and literacy expert, Gentry offers sound advice on how parents can develop strong reading and writing skills in children starting at birth through age seven. He provides plenty of activities through five literacy learning phases, from a child’s early attempts at scribbling to handling early-reader books alone. Gentry’s advice ranges from the well known (reading to children at an early age and talking to them at length and in an encouraging manner to help develop vocabulary) to the more neurological based (understanding the importance of drawing as a preparation for learning to read). He tackles the debates on reading theories—whole language versus phonics-based. Using age-specific vignettes, he describes capabilities and methods of teaching reading and writing, focusing on a child’s individual development, and advises parents on how to monitor development and “test” for progress. An abundance of graphics add to the value of this useful resource for parents. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And it shone too on the girl, idling to and fro on the swing under the great mulberry tree on the edge of the lawn at one side of the house.She was a big girl, splendidly built, with a lovely face framed by dark curling hair, her creamy skin already faintly tanned by the spring sunshine. She was wearing beautifully cut slacks which had seen better days and a silk shirt with its sleeves rolled up above her elbows. That was well worn too but of excellent cut. She swung slowly to and fro, her dark brows drawn together in a frown, for once unaware of her beautiful surroundings. She said softly: 'Something will have to be done.' And the elderly labrador lying beside the swing cocked an ear and turned mild brown eyes to look at her.The girl put up a shapely hand to push the hair away from her face. She looked around her, at the herbaceous border on the far side of a lawn which badly needed mowing, the hedge of lavender, the paved path leading to a half hidden pond, and beyond to the tumbledown fence and the fields. She sighed and allowed her gaze to dwell on the house, quite enchanting in the sunshine; a small Elizabethan manor house, a jewel of a place to the casual eye, but to those who lived in it a constant source of anxiety, with its leaky roof, woodworm in the beams, damp seeping up into the passages and old-fashioned kitchen. Nothing, she reflected bitterly, that couldn't be put right with money. Only there wasn't any of that; her father, absentminded scholar that he was, had drawn steadily on his capital for years now, and her mother, her dear, charming mother, hadn't economised; she had tried, with the best will in the world, but she had no idea how to set about it, and if Celine suggested that they should have a casserole instead of roast pheasant or salmon trout, her parent always had a ready answer, even if an illogical one.Celine got off the swing and strolled back to the house and opened the door in the kitchen garden wall and went through to see how things were growing. Thomas, the very old gardener, did very little now, but he was still paid his full wages, it would never have entered anyone's head to have done otherwise, but they badly needed help. Celine did her best, but she was still the veriest amateur. The expensive boarding school she had been to and the finishing school in Switzerland hadn't taught gardening, and when she came home, it was taken for granted that she would stay there, doing the flowers, playing tennis with numerous friends in the neighbourhood, helping with the annual Garden Party and the Church whist drives, and going occasionally to London with her mother to buy clothes. Expensive clothes too, Jaeger and the better class boutiques, and Raynes or Gucci for shoes. And she hadn't given it a thought; her father had lived all his life in the old house, and his father and grandfather before him, and heaven knows how many forebears, she had rather taken it for granted that there was money enough, and when occasionally she had mentioned the leaky roof and the peeling paint, her father had looked vaguely surprised for a moment and had remarked that he really must do something about them. But he never had; she realised with a shock of surprise that she had been home for three years; it was only during the last few months that she had begun to notice things. Old Barney was still with them, but then he had been her father's batman during the war, and Angela, their cook, who had always been there too, but when Joan the maid had left to get married, she had been replaced by Mrs Stokes from the village who obliged twice a week, and several bedrooms had been shut up.She bent and pulled a couple of radishes, rubbed the earth off them, and crunched into them. She should have done something about it, of course, and she felt bitterly ashamed. Here she was, twenty-two years old, nicely up in the social graces but a complete stranger to shorthand and typing, nursing, teaching the young, or even serving in a shop, and without any of these skills how was she to get money, because money was what was needed; her home had to be kept from falling to the ground. It was a pity that she had refused the wholesale manufacturer of cotton goods who had wanted to marry her; he was a rich man. Indeed, now she came to think about it, she had refused several comfortably off young men, under the impression—mistaken, she now saw—that one should marry for love.She whistled to Dusty, stretched out on the grass path, and turned back to the house. Mr Timms, the family solicitor, was coming to see her father that morning; her mother had mentioned it and looked worried, but when Celine had asked what was the matter, she wasn't told anything. That was the trouble, she thought unhappily; she had been born unexpectedly when her parents were verging on middle age, and they still thought of her as a child to be shielded from anything unpleasant. Not that they had spoiled her, but she had been brought up in a kind of effortless comfort; money was never mentioned and she hadn't bothered over-much about it. She loved her home dearly. If she hadn't perhaps she would have trained for something and got a job by now…She went in through the kitchen door, stopped to talk to Angela whose elderly feet were hurting her, then went through the stone-flagged passage to the hall; there were flagstones here, too, and panelled walls and oak rafters and narrow latticed windows. She stopped to smell the lilac standing in a great vase in one corner and went into the dining-room.Her mother and father were already there, her mother, a small, pretty woman with bright blue eyes, busy with her post, her father, tall and thin and scholarly, behind his newspaper. Celine kissed them in turn and took her seat at the table.'What time is Mr Timms coming?' she asked. Her father didn't answer; she turned her lovely grey eyes on her mother, who looked up briefly.'About ten o'clock, dear. We'd better have him to lunch.'Celine poured herself some coffee and began on a boiled egg. 'Father, why is he coming?' And when her parent grunted: 'Is it about money? I've never bothered about it, I'm afraid, but now I think I ought to be told.'He lowered the paper and looked at her over the top. 'There's no need…' he began.She interrupted him gently. 'There is, you know. Father, are we broke?'He looked uneasy. 'The truth is, my dear, I'm not quite sure. It is true there isn't a great deal of money left, and unfortunately I made one or two investments a couple of months ago and they haven't turned out quite as I had hoped.'She buttered some toast. Her insides were cold, she could hardly get the next question out for very fright. 'We shan't have to leave here…?''Unthinkable,' declared her father. 'In any case, who would buy the place? It's falling down.''But Father, isn't there anything to be done? I mean, couldn't we patch it up a bit where it needs it most?'Colonel Baylis was on the whole a mild, rather dreamy man, but he could, on occasion, return to the parade-ground manner. 'There's no need for you to concern yourself about such things,' he told her severely. 'We shall come about; Mr Timms will advise me…' He retired behind his newspaper once more and Celine turned to her mother.'Mother—' she began.'Your father is always right, darling,' said Mrs Baylis, and Celine sighed and went on eating her egg. Her mother was a darling, but she was impractical, she had no idea how to be economical, and it was a little too late in life to begin now. She wondered what Mr Timms would have to say.Whatever Mr Timms had to say was for her father's ears alone, it seemed. The two gentlemen retired to the Colonel's study as soon as he had arrived and didn't emerge until it was almost time to have lunch, when they joined Mrs Baylis and Celine in the drawing-room; low-ceilinged, panelled walls, and shabby but still grand furniture. They drank their sherry and made polite conversation, then they crossed the hall to the dining-room, equally low-ceilinged but a good deal smaller, its chintz curtains faded to the pale pastel colours of the Savonnerie carpet, its dark oak furniture adequately dusted but unpolished.The lunch was excellent; Angela was a good cook, and Celine, who had learned to cook to Cordon Bleu standard at the finishing school, had whipped up a delicate soufflé to follow the pâté and toast, with a fruit tart to follow. But however excellent the fare, it did nothing to dispel Mr Timms' severe gloom; even the Chablis the Colonel had fetched from the cellar hadn't helped. Celine, taking her part in the talk, bided her time.She had her opportunity presently, when after a decent interval drinking coffee, Mr Timms prepared to leave. He had taken the village taxi from the station, but now Celine said quickly: 'I'll run you down in the car, Mr Timms,' and was on her way to the garage before anyone could object.There were two cars—a far from new but beautifully kept Jaguar and a Mini. The Jag soaked up petrol, but somehow she couldn't see Mr Timms squashed into the Mini. She drove the big car round to the front of the house where she found him waiting outside the open door with her parents.As she turned out of the gates at the bottom of the short drive she asked: 'Will you tell me what it's all about, Mr Timms? And I'mnot just being curious; Father has hinted… it's so hard on them both. They can't change their ways now, you know, but perhaps there's something to be done.''I don't know…' began Mr Timms primly, then looked astonished as Celine stopped the car on the side of the lane. 'If you tell me quickly,' she said sweetly, 'you'll be in nice time for your train.''This is quite improper—' he began testily as she turned to look at him. She was a lovely girl, her enormous eyes be-seeched him. For once he stifled his profess...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2002 it was realized when she became a fulltime writer, releasing her first novel, Black Beauty in 2004. In 2007, after weeks of negotiations, this bestselling author came out of her self-imposed exile, and signed with Hollygrove Publishing joining the literary team headed by national Best Selling Author, Brian W. Smith. Because her readers had been clamoring for her next work, Elaine decided to give them more than they expected. It's Morning: Torn Lovers and Their Stories (2008) is her second book, comprised of two novellas and one short story where each one has a love triangle with two men and one woman. This book is designed to make those who have followed her writing, rejoice that she has come back and those who had never heard of her, never forget her name. The long-awaited Broken Appointments will be Ms. Flowers' third work of fiction. Expected to be released at the end of 2010, this novel will be a spin-off of sorts with two of the characters from Black Beauty. Yes, more beauty salon drama. In the interim, this gifted writer is having great success with her first try at non fiction. I Wouldn't Mind Having a Husband, I Just Don't Want to Be Somebody's Wife: The Single Woman's Guide to Self-fulfillment is a self help e-book designed for single-never-beenmarried women who are egregiously seeking a husband. During her days behind the hydraulic chair, Ms. Flowers encountered many single women desperate to get married as well as many married women desperate to be single again. She wondered if single women knew what married women knew, would they still be so anxious to go down that road? Maybe, maybe not; but if they were equipped with the information of what it meant to be a wife they could have a new appreciation for their singleness while waiting for Mister to come along. Elaine Flowers is a divorcee of 20 years with an adult daughter, Erin (24) and son, Lexington (21).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here is a model of economic tract. Lavishly illustrated with political cartoons, it contains but one algebraic equation, and that probably unavoidable.\"--James Grant,Wall Street Journal\"In his new book, Douglas A. Irwin tells the fascinating story of how Congress stubbornly passed a bill that, as opponents noted at the time, was truly doomed to fail.\"--Roger Lowenstein,New Republic's The Book\"[Irwin's] account of how the act came about is at once a thorough study and a breezy read. The often overblown rhetoric that Smoot-Hawley has inspired, seemingly from the start, also means that the book is often surprisingly amusing. . . . Mr. Irwin's description of how an attempt to prop up America's agricultural sector metastasised into a law that raised nearly 1,000 import tariffs, mostly on manufacturing products, is fascinating.\"--Economist\"Peddling Protectionism, by the economist and historian Douglas Irwin, is a vivid, anecdotal, judicious telling of timeless story: what happens when cocksure politicians fall into the grip of a really bad economic idea.\"--Christopher Caldwell,Financial Times\"InPeddling Protectionism, a short, clear and graceful book, in which maps, photographs and cartoons complement the handful of tables and graphs, Irwin makes a surprisingly lively story of the tradition of tariff revisions in the United States, the domestic politics that produced the Smoot-Hawley statute, in particular the various retaliatory measures that ensued. . . . [I]f only economists could write more books like it about other controversies!\"--David Warsh,Economic Principals\"In his wonderful new bookPeddling Protectionism, Dartmouth College economist and historian Douglas A. Irwin warns that congress, left on its own to fashion trade policy, will quickly be captured by special interests.\"--Daniel Griswold,Washington Times\"Irwin's encyclopedic knowledge of the literature on Smoot-Hawley will make this the standard work on the subject for many years to come. . . . The memory of Smoot-Hawley and its link to the Great Depression is one of the few things that keeps protectionism in check. For this reason,Peddling Protectionismdeserves a wide readership.\"--Fiscal Times\"[P]ersuasive.\"--Arnold Kling,Econlog\"The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, named after two congressmen who sponsored it, raised U.S. duties on thousands of imported goods. Its ramifications on world trade reverberated for decades. In this comprehensive history, Irwin examines the political wrangling that caused the yearlong delay in its passage.\"--Library Journal\"A rarity among books of its ilk,Peddling Protectionismis a stellar read both as a historical narrative and an economic text. As mundane as the issues at hand might sound--think of Ben Stein's famous monotonic lecture about Smoot-Hawley in Ferris Bueller's Day Off--Irwin makes them comprehensible and even enjoyable to consider, peppering his text with anecdotes and contemporary political cartoons as he unpacks the economic context that led to the act's passage.\"--Asa Fitch,The National\"Irwin's book is not technical; he summarizes research findings, including his own, but does not formally present models or econometric results. His approach makes the book quite suitable for the interested general reader, undergraduates, and economic historians and other economists interested in the life and times of Smoot-Hawley. Finally, this volume is well priced for individual purchase and is nicely illustrated with a number of photographs and political cartoons of the day. It is also mercifully free of the typos that plague so many university press books these days.\"--Anthony Patrick O'Brien,EH.Net\"Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and one of the world's leading scholars of international trade, makes a careful, fact-freighted case.\"--David R. Henderson,Regulation\"Irwin's outstanding book will teach even well-informed scholars a great deal about the history and politics that produced the Smoot-Hawley tariff as well as about its economic and political consequences. Read Irwin's book for the important details. . . . No better guide to Smoot-Hawley's history and consequences is available than Doug Irwin. His scholarship is impeccable; his reasoning is sure and never overreaching; and his prose is clean and direct. His little volume may not be the last word on Smoot-Hawley (Are there ever last words on any subject?), but it is to date the finest set of words devoted exclusively to that justly infamous spectacle of American protectionism.\"--Donald J. Boudreaux,Independent Review\"[I]rwin's recent bookPeddling Protectionismdemolishes the conventional wisdom [of the Smoot-Hawley tariff].\"--Robert J. Samuelson,Wilson Quarterly\"[Irwin's book is] eminently readable, and will be of interest to all those concerned with trade policy and the trading system, as well as being valuable for upper division undergraduate seminars. The particulars of the political arguments for and against SH, the quotes of opinions of policy makers, and the marshalling of evidence regarding policy choices and attempts at international cooperation make the period come alive and simultaneously enable a balanced assessment regarding the role of trade policy and its determinants.\"--Anne O. Krueger,Journal of World Trade Review\"[T]his book is a welcome contribution to the field. Several of the old 'wisdoms' regarding the tariff are presented and analysed, and the empirical evidence brought forth by Irwin is convincing. The course of events is concisely presented in a chronological manner. Irwin has collected quite a number of political cartoons, caricatures and quotations to illustrate the debate of contemporaries and scholars that both entertain and point to the gravity of the issue. All this adds nicely to the economic analyses. The lines of arguments and the analyses of the author in the book are convincing and accessible to both scholars and the general reader.\"--Peter Hedberg,Scandinavian Economic History Review\"It is, to put it mildly, a challenge to write an interesting and lively history of tariff policy. In his graceful study of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, economist Douglas Irwin successfully rises to the task. . . . Scholars of the period will find much that is valuable in Irwin's analytical and readable narrative.\"--Jason Scott Smith,Journal of American Studies", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hogan's deft, laconic style moves us swiftly from scene to scene, visiting past and present, alternating comic and dramatic exchanges with fine descriptions of landscape, detailed accounts of animal husbandry and set pieces of close observation... An impressive work, grimly bawdy, tense and moving' The Sunday Times 'Hogan's considerable powers of description convince the reader... evocations of landscape and wildlife have a particular vividness' TLS 'The Hunger Trace shows Hogan's talent developing further. There's a village in peril here too, but the main focus lies with the characters. Hogan's writing illuminates their inner lives with startling clarity. In the novel's latter sections, it is as if Hogan sets them free to perform as an ensemble, bouncing off each other in order to take the story where it must go. The narrative is supported with acute descriptive prose, with the Derbyshire landscape a constant refrain... Hogan's talent for depicting atmospheric, grainy settings does lend itself to a grand mise-en-scene... The Hunger Trace is an extended trope upon the dynamics of love and affection: of what can happen both when they are offered, and when they are withheld' Independent 'This is a novel of secrets, of things buried deep in the long grass of the landscape, and Hogan manages to keep these both mysterious and intriguing. The writing is beautifully exact, and the evocation of the surroundings mesmerising. It is a book that demands to be read' Booktrust UK http://www.booktrust.org.uk/show/book/Books we like/The-Hunger-Trace 'It's one of Hogan's strengths that he can write with such bleakly beautiful romanticism about an area not exactly over-documented in popular fiction... Seductive, the early sections charged with a sense of emotional claustrophobia within the wilderness... Gripping... impressive' Metro 'The shocking revelation of a childhood secret and the poignant search for human warmth in the midst of strained relationships help make this a rich and moving second novel' Waterstone's Books Quarterly, March issue 'A soaring, unconventional book in which stunted emotional growth and lack of fulfilment are striking themes... Superb passages of nature writing. Louisa's sense of oneness with her falcons recalls Barry Hines's classic A Kestrel for a Knave or TH White's The Goshawk, and, in Louisa herself, the supremely solitary figure of Emily Bronte with her pet hawk' Daily Telegraph 'Hogan is only 30 but has the look of a writer of whom more will be heard. His prose is devoid of flamboyance but he has taken a situation and developed it with real psychological acuity' Mail on Sunday 'Dreamy mix of the banal and the numinous infuses a book in which the real star of the show is the place being written about... It's a persuasive central message in an elegant, compelling story...a gripping book' Sarah Crown, Guardian 23/4 'For all its very English concerns -- rural life, weather, tight lips -- Edward Hogan's taut second novel, The Hunger Trace, stakes out a territory of high emotion... Hogan excels at tracing unspoken dramas between characters... The attention to feeling and language is commensurate with the author's eye for physical detail. In an unshowy way he fills the novel with rich descriptions... wittily revealing the unpleasant as well as the pretty... The pleasure of The Hunger Trace lies in its precision. Even as the pace quickens Hogan doesn't lose sight of accuracy.

In 1992, Moller and her mother moved from California to southern Oregon where they converted a twenty-acre chicken ranch into a beautiful boarding stable. Moller gave lessons and hosted riding clinics at the boarding stable for nine years before downsizing to a comfortable five-acre spread in Cave Junction, Oregon.

Sometimes they align well pre or post the masticating. Sometimes said words align humorously. Once they made someone cry. We don't know why. Most times the words get tossed in an electronic waste receptacle to be reused in a more conventional manor by someone who probably DID pay attention in seventh grade English and did learn about grammar, punctuation and run on sentences while Walter was listening to his ADHD and trying desperately to sit still. . Walter used to spend a boatload of time in airplanes crossing the little pond between the North East of the new world and the old continent. Australian Shiraz fueled much of the word proliferation during that time until Walter switched to Cabernet Sauvignon. . These days Walter does a little repetitive South to North travel path and dusts off some old words and tries to make sense of what ever nonsense he intended at the time. Most of his ramblings fall into silly children's books or old style Science Fiction. One SciFi book involves a fat lady and a Volvo. Walter's first Kindle offering involves a young girl that reminds him a bit of his daughter. There are three more books in the series (so far) and if Walter would stop obsessively reading web stuff about how to get his nonsense novel noticed and trying to convince people to cough up 2.99 American and instead got back to Cabernet and Microsoft Word he could release book two of the whole Corie Universe Feeder thingy. Book three takes a few odds turns and almost makes a point or two.

Alan Caruba is a charter member of the National Book Critics Circle and has been reviewing for more than five decades.Another novel has Judaism at its core and takes a page of largely unknown history as its theme.The Messiah of Septimaniaby Lee Levin ($16.95, Royal Heritage Press, softcover) tells of the medieval Jewish Kingdom of Septimania and its first king; one with three different names, a man hailed as the Messiah. During the reign of Caesar Augustus, veterans of the Roman Seventh Legion (Septimanii) settled in a land just north of the Pyrenees. There was, indeed, such a region, but it is not known as a Jewish kingdom and the author has \"borrowed\" it for his own purposes, noting that in 70 A.D., the Romans had conquered Jerusalem and allegedly took the Holy Menorah back to Rome. In 410, the city was sacked by Visigoths who were said to have taken it back to their capital, Rhedae, in Septimania. It vanished. Or did it? The novel is written with a strict adherence to historical accuracy and introduces us to a Jewish King, said to have been an uncle to Charlemagne and whose bloodline intermingled with the Carolingian kings of France. His army protected the southern flank of Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom. The novel that Levin has woven from these strands of history will keep the reader entranced.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nine of the 15 selections are set in Seven Devils, a decaying bayou backwater that epitomizes the \"dark side to small town life.\" The stand-out opener, \"The Sunday-Go-to-Meeting Jaw,\" sets the tone for the rest of the selections with its haunting account of a returned rebel soldier whose mutilated face is a grotesque symbol of the defeated Confederacy. Despair, insanity and violence achieve near elemental force in the more modern stories. \"How It Was with the Kraits\" takes a page out of Tennessee Williams in its grim chronicle of family dysfunction and a doomed mother and son \"needing each other so bad love and hate became one and the same thing.\" One of the few stories with a standard supernatural theme, \"Raymond,\" paints a sympathetic portrait of a child whose lobotomy seems a greater perversion of nature than the werewolf instincts it's meant to curb. Collins largely eschews the degenerate stereotypes and suffocating atmosphere of dread typical of the southern Gothic, building her stories instead on studies of characters just desperate or dim enough to indulge base motives that drive them to criminal or supernatural ends.

In this book, Taylor pulls these loose threads together and weaves them into a simple, coherent whole, presenting Swedenborg’s teachings as a system that anyone can follow. Taylor describes the external or natural mind as primarily concerned with material things, and the inner mind, in its essence, as love. As we elevate our thoughts toward higher and higher types of love and wisdom, we draw closer to God and begin the process of regeneration, or rebirth as spiritual beings.This is the first time in many decades that a book has been published on Swedenborg’s philosophy of the mind. Taylor’s straightforward commentary gives readers a rare insight into this crucial aspect of Swedenborg’s theology.", "related": ["B008P8UCKW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Justin Lin, with some help from other distinguished scholars, has succeeded in laying out the complex structural microeconomic dynamics of economic growth, diversification and development, and in capturing the crucial complementary roles of government as investor, regulator, coordinator of activity and expectations, and guide. All of this is set in a global economy that is itself in the midst of massive structural change. This book will become an essential reference for scholars and for policy makers not only in developing countries, but also, increasingly, in developed countries.' --Michael Spence, William R. Berkley Professor in Economics and Business, New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business; 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics'This splendid collection of essays, by one of the world's outstanding experts on economic development, puts to work a newly emerging view, which he has helped to shape, of why in recent decades some countries have prospered while others have languished. Lin's focus is on countries that were all economically underdeveloped six decades ago, but his analysis offers strong hints about future prospects of the rich world as well. His style is dispassionate and unadorned by drama, which makes the essays all the more moving and illuminating.' --Sir Partha Dasgupta, Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of Economics, University of Cambridge", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this brilliant and effecting meditation on death and what might lie beyond, formerLos Angeles Timeswriter Erika Hayasaki pursues that very question, one with which she's become \"quietly obsessed\" since her college days when she moonlighted as an obit writer for a local Illinois newspaper. Hayasaki examines all aspects of the question, describing moving scenes of near-death and life-after-death experiences, exploring the science behind them, and tracing the emotional crescendo that comes with approaching death. Woven throughout is the story of her Uncle Richard, who survived a near-death experience 20 years ago, and who eventually succumbs to a chain-smoking habit that he'd kicked decades earlier. Hayasaki's telling of how she sought out and bonded with her bright but distant uncle is worth the price of admission alone. But for those who wonder what lies beyond, this is a must-read piece capable of generating real chills. --Chris Schluep", "related": ["B008BB92EK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.4167, "rating_total": 53.0}

But having a baby at age 14 is a sure sign that the teen made a mistake somewhere along the line. Deserted by the infant's father and with her own mother dead, Jane returns to school, fearing she will no longer be popular and successful; she will just be \"the girl with a baby.\" She finds unexpected support from other students and her family, in particular, her Native American grandmother, Teh, who guides her along the path that leads her to be the strong and wise young woman she was meant to become. This is a rite-of-passage story, joining the strength and tradition of Jane's tribal heritage as given to her by her people with her personal struggle to face and win her own battles. Lyrical passages of tribal life mirror Jane's contemporary thoughts and dreams. She discovers that Destiny is aptly named, for her child transforms the lives of all the people she touches, especially her mother. Set in Canada, this contemporary novel beautifully blends a realistic story of teenage life with a unique view of an old and largely unknown Native American culture. This is a common story told uncommonly well.–Jane Halsall, McHenry Public Library District, ILCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I chose to write this one first because so many people appreciated my advice on how to sayno. Often people attending my talks wanted to set personal boundaries ... but they just didn't have the words. And when they did speak up, they would often find themselves in endless debate with someone - someone who didn't have their best interests at heart.Sayingnocan be intimidating. We can feel guilty putting ourselves first, and too often others are willing to take advantage of our good nature. And even when you're ready to stand up for yourself, what do you say? How do you stop that endless debate - the excuses and explanations that you really don't want to give in the first place?So I wrote this first book to help you to find the words. To show you how to set boundaries gracefully. No excuses, no justifications. It's amazing how powerful that can be.The next book in the series, which I hope to publish in February, is subtitled7 Keys to Making Difficult Choices. This book is focused on how to make those tough decisions, with less emphasis on the words and more on the things to watch out for. Sometimes things are not as simple as they appear to be.7 Keyswill help you to foresee the possible pitfalls and make  choices that will work for you. And don't worry ... I will still help you with the words!I write, speak and teach because I love it when people \"get it.\" I love it when I can show someone what's happening in a difficult situation and give them the tools to set things right. Setting boundaries with difficult people can be a life-changing event. And I love nothing more than being a part of that change! So I'd love to hear from you, whether it's to share your experience or ask for advice.

We lived in Southern Arizona with intensely hot summers and no sprinkler system, yet my mother was determined to have flowers around us. Rather than a flower garden, she choose to grow her flowers in pots, particularly the hardy geranium, which she gently cared for day-after-day. Under her care, they flourished.As a young married woman living in California, a more temperate climate, I began to surround my own home with flowers - agapanthus, impatiens, primroses, bougainvillea, sweet alyssum, etc. Digging in the dirt and watching the flowers bloom gave me a special kind of pleasure.Even though I loved roses, I always thought they would be far too difficult to grow, so I never tried. Finally a few years ago, I took the plunge and have never looked back. My yard is now filled with roses.My first book,Growing Roses, Everything You Need to Know, and More . . .is my way of sharing with you what I learned from my experience. The main lesson is, that growing roses is not difficult.I hope that you will give yourself the gift of a rose garden, which can be nothing more than a single bush that will give you pleasure day-after-day, as my mother's potted plants gave her.", "related": ["B005SHNKYI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 35.0}

It is a book of life back in the early days and how it might have been for two orphaned children. It is a journey that crosses two countries.

His primary folklore interest was in the folktale and he rapidly became one the country's leading experts in that field. His publications include English Fairy and Other Folk Tales (1890), an anthology of texts, and The Science of Fairytales: An Enquiry into the Fairy Mythology (1891), which attempted a theory of the subject, based firmly in the ruling doctrine of survivals and the belief that the expert can identify and apply the rules governing folklore. Hartland's tour de force was the influential three-volume The Legend of Perseus: A Study of Tradition in Story, Custom and Belief (1894-6). In this he followed the conviction that tales encapsulate custom and belief of the past, and by tracing a particular story and its analogues across the world and across time, the folklorist can seek to understand the primitive mind of our ancestors. As his researches into folklore and anthropology deepened, Hartland moved away from a primarily narrative base to a more ethnological concern with primitive societies and the origins of religion, although he always used evidence from myths and legends in his argument.", "related": ["B004OR1G4O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The time and place details were perfect for the early 1950's, and the fashion details were great. My own childhood was a decade later, but I, too, remember feeling grown up reading Seventeen magazine. In this story, Katherine embarks reluctantly on a holiday trip to visit her grandmother. It's an annual trip with her mother, so Katherine knows exactly how bad it is going to be.Katherine is intrigued by the red velvet box, which is very special to her grandmother. It holds old ornaments, each with their own story. I particularly loved that the ornaments weren't valuable imported blown glass. Most are handmade from paper. This is very true to the time and very good comment on value. The box is very magical, but not in a wizard sense. The magic lies in the precious family memories that the ornaments hold.Of course Katherine learns a lesson about the value of family that tugs at the reader. Overall, the story is short enough to share over and over again and is heartwarming enough that you want to do so.At the end of the story, Keleny includes directions to make one of the paper ornaments in the red velvet box. I actually made these ornaments myself in Girl Scouts, and I often make them in my classroom with my students. I can hardly wait to read the story to my class before creating ornaments this year!", "related": [], "rank": 2379795, "title": "The Red Velvet Box", "author": "Christine Keleny", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also understand\nthat when a hunter from the East decides to go to the West to hunt elk, he's\nmade a sizeable commitment of time and money to try and take one of the elk -\none of the most noble of all God's creatures. For these reasons, I wanted to\ninterview some of the best elk hunters I knew, who hunt elk every year in\nseveral states, guide and take elk on TV, to learn their best strategies for\ntaking the really-big bulls. The men in this book are some of the best elk\nhunters I've ever known or met, and the tips they provide can shortcut years of\nground-pounding, hoping to hear a bugle or catch-up to a bull.", "related": ["B007WUWNQU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rodger is a British science fiction & fantasy author and game designer best known for his novels set in a near-future world of corporate and political intrigue. So far he has published seven novels; five that are set in the same world: God Seed; Dante’s Fool; Iron Man Project, Edge and Living in Flames and two, Dog Eat Dog, and The Black Lake set within the world of Yellow Dawn. Yellow Dawn is a role-playing game set in the same future world as his novels, ten years after it has been devastated by a terrible mutagenic virus. Rodger's novels often combine high-tech intrigue and political/corporate machinations with elements of the Cthulhu Mythos, as created by H.P. Lovecraft. Rodger's contributions to the Mythos include the creation of several new Great Old Ones through his novels Edge, Dog Eat Dog and Living in Flames, and the use of the Outer God Nyarlathotep in the novel God Seed. In Yellow Dawn Rodger's interpretation of the Mythos, in particular the Great Old One Hastur, is a major part of the background material. Rodger also published Shadows of the Quantinex, a large-scale campaign expansion for the Yellow Dawn game. Rodger has also written Cloudy Head, a children's story illustrated by Kenn-Ole Moen, and Murder at Sharky Point, a murder mystery game. Rodger recently put together a collection of his favourite short stories of the last 15 years in Songs of Spheres, including a brief intro about each story. Rodger spent 8 years working for a non-departmental government agency, developing a virtual communications service within the IT Division, before moving into commercial project management for a UK media company. In 2000 Rodger's presence on the Internet got him a place in the BBC documentary Through The Eyes of the Young, directed by Chris Terrill. Rodger now lives in Bristol, England, with a Braun coffee-maker, writing from a house on a hill with a view of Earth's curve.", "related": [], "rank": 1282197, "title": "The Black Lake eBook", "author": "David J Rodger", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some will say it’s a very vivid tale from a very strange author. Others will tell you that I should be locked up, that things like this just aren’t true. But they are. The story I want to tell you really happened.  How do I know? Well, I was there.  The dragon king, Envir gave me permission to come back from his world and told me to tell the story so that others, people like the ones in the story will know there is hope.   I will tell you my name is K. S. Carol.  I’m not…not really.  But for the purpose of this book that’s who I’ll be.  I’m a teller of tales and the scribe of my world. Not this one, but one that defies all that you have known. Aurora was having a bad day.  Actually she was having a bad life.  Her mother had just died and she inherited a tapestry, a knife and a box.  But she didn’t want them.  She wanted her well ordered life to go on well ordered.  But the Lady Elizabeth and Envir decided that things would be better if she came to them. So when she was trying to decide what to do with these new gifts she fell into the beautiful tapestry.   Her life as she’d known it was gone.  The world in which she found herself in was rich in magic, creatures she’d never heard of and a few she thought only to be myth.  Aurora was their only hope and she thought that with her… Well, it would be very unfair of me to tell you the whole of her story before I’ve begun the tale now wouldn’t it?.", "related": ["B00JWCBQAA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During his incarceration from 2005 to 2008 he realized there was a higher calling on his life. Reflecting back to the periods between 1996 to 2005, Nardo was inspired to write a book about the most pivetol era of his life. \"A Stripper Scorned\" is a reflection of his life, the fast money he made, the circle of individuals he associated with and the outlandish women/strippers he met and indulged in.

Her second book was chosen as a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2010.Courtney lives in the Rocky Mountains with her husband, a medium-sized dog, and an attack cat.Carolyn JewelCarolyn Jewel was born on a moonless night. That darkness was seared into her soul and she became an award winning author of historical and paranormal romance. She has a very dusty car and a Master's degree in English that proves useful at the oddest times. An avid fan of fine chocolate, finer heroines, Bollywood films, and heroism in all forms, she has three cats and a dog. Also a son. One of the cats is his.Sherry ThomasSherry Thomas burst onto the scene with PRIVATE ARRANGEMENTS, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2008. Her sophomore book, DELICIOUS, is a Library Journal Best Romance of 2008. Her next two books, NOT QUITE A HUSBAND and HIS AT NIGHT, are back-to-back winners of Romance Writers of America's prestigious RITA Award for Best Historical Romance in 2010 and 2011.  Lisa Kleypas calls her \"the most powerfully original historical romance author working today.\"Her story is all the more interesting given that English is Sherry's second language--she has come a long way from the days when she made her laborious way through Rosemary Roger's SWEET SAVAGE LOVE with an English-Chinese dictionary. She enjoys digging down to the emotional core of stories.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00ATV53KC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The glimpses Laferriere records of people on the devastated streets of Port-au-Prince accrue to give a deeper substance to the idea of Haitian indomitability.\" —Slate.com\"A compelling firsthand account with cleverly crafted imagery and skilfully interwoven narrative strands about a country shook to its bare bones, fighting to defeat the shadow of death ... Just as T.S. Eliot’sThe Waste Landis made up of seemingly disjointed images that work together to create a whole, so too is Laferrière’s memoir. It is this ‘heap of broken images’ – to borrow Eliot’s words – that are held together by the strongest thread of all: culture.\" —ARC magazine\"Laferrière has written not only a valuable book but also a necessary one, a slim but potent volume reminding us that the people of Haiti deserve far better than the cards handed to them by fate ... In a just world, this book will excite renewed passion for helping Haiti and also a large audience for Laferrière himself, a talented writer who deserves a wide readership.\" —National Post\"The World is Moving Around Meis unpretentious, starkly honest and good-humoured. Laferrière, a prize-winning novelist in the francophone literary world, is a masterful writer and his memoir, told in a clear and simple voice beautifully rendered by translator David Homel, is true to his vision of the essential role of culture, 'the only thing that can stand up to the earthquake … intellectual culture [and] what structures a nation.

Having four lively, silly and very lovable grandsons and a very naughty grand-dog gave him all the material he needed. He took up the challenge and Ziggy – Cheeky Doggy Tales is the outcome. However, he wanted to make the stories a bit different. For a start they are all told from the dog’s point of view and to mirror that, the delightful pictures (drawn by Rachael Reeves) show only the legs and feet of the children. The dog is definitely centre-stage. He is also very clever – he can understand human speech and even spell (badly). But being a puppy he is naughty and fascinated by bowel and bladder functions.  This is the first in a series of books that follow Ziggy as he grows up. But just as the acts of naughtiness become less frequent, the family welcomes a newcomer to the house and the excitement starts all over again. The stranger is very old and very tall, and although he has a face and hands and can speak, he isn’t like others. Now the dog’s life moves in an entirely new direction. Coming under the influence of the new arrival and unhindered by the laws of physics, Ziggy acquires supernatural powers. Travelling through time and space, his adventures become even more heroic and amazing, although at heart he remains the same kind, brave and lovable animal he always was. This is not James Hill’s first foray into writing. His first book, THE UPRIGHTS, (available as a paperback from Amazon as well as an e-book from the Kindle Store) is set 50,000 years ago and shows what life might have been like for a group of early humans. Physically identical to us in every respect (although no doubt, not so well washed) – they struggled to make sense of a hostile and mysterious world. Not only that, they were outnumbered by lions, Neanderthals and other more powerful predators: in a very real sense, they were an endangered species: one animal among many – and a rather puny one at that. So how did they survive – and indeed prosper? The book tries to show how this might have happened. Before he retired, James Hill was a clinical psychiatrist. He lives near London with his wife, while their children have moved to pastures new: their daughter to Stratford-upon-Avon and their son to Wellington , New Zealand.", "related": ["B00D7BVTIQ"], "rank": 2513647, "title": "Ziggy - Cheeky Doggy Tales (Ziggy - Doggy Tales for Children Book 1)", "author": "James Hill", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He founded a weekly newspaper in Houston, Texas and later shifted into advertising; first by establishing his own ad agency and later accepting a succession of two positions as Director of Advertising in the financial services industry. Bored, and unchallenged he switched industries and ran his own mortgage company. Finally he began writing again, as his mother had predicted. He is working on his next Cindy Jones book and other novels as well as children’s books. Aside from writing he has created a large collection of fine art photographs. Look for his first book to be published soon, titled MY NY – Fifty observations of street life in New York between 1968-1970. He has lived in the locals that he writes about, portraying the places with a penchant for special details. He currently lives in the Tampa, Florida area.

This is, in many ways, an old-fashioned book chronicling the transformation of a cycling-mad kid from West Sussex into possibly the most respected domestique in the peloton, who also claimed a famous time-trial stage victory of the Tour de France in 1988 and wore the yellow jersey for a day in 1994. This book does full credit to an outstanding career.\" -- Brendan Gallagher Sweetspot Cycling Book of the Year shortlist nomination \"A very good read... one of those rare well written cycling autobiographies that engages the reader... better by far than the other recent autobiographies that could be filed under 'British Cycling and My Role in Its Rise to Glory'. The whole thing has a charming, casual air about it, like a couple of old mates sitting down over a pint and reminiscing about the past. It's nice to be reminded why Yates used to be such a legend.\" Podium Cafe \"Sean Yates is the real deal - tremendous determination, talent and commitment - the classic hard man from that era. In a way reading the book made me glad I didn't become a pro cyclist.\" Cycling Uphill \"For years Sean Yates was by far and away the most successful British rider in the Tour de France since Tommy Simpson. Then came Cavendish, Froome and most of all Wiggins. After retiring from racing Sean Yates was to become Team Sky's Race Director and a figure central to Wiggins' 2012 Tour victory.

Cover your cock with it too.\nIt's better to use more than you need than not enough.\" The infusion\nof the lubricant had felt good, but Lester quivered with excitement as he felt\nthe long finger eased into his ass, far enough to massage his prostate gland,\nwhich he usually thought of as being his equivalent of a girl's clit. When the\nfinger was withdrawn, Lester pictured his dorm mate coating his cock and\ncontinued holding his ass cheeks apart. His legs were spread wide, and he felt\nthe bed shaking as the other man knelt between them and, to support his weight,\nplaced his left hand on one side of the horny gay man's nude body.  Although he\nhad never fucked anybody's ass before, Martin's cock had been in enough pussies\nthat he had no problem figuring out what to do. The white butt with the soft\ncheeks and the pink rosebud looked more appealing than some of those pussies\nhad anyhow. Holding his cock with one hand to guide it, he lowered his body\nuntil the tip was pressed up against the puckered area that was his goal. Even\nas Martin looked down, Lester moved his fingers slightly to separate the edges\nof the hole, and Martin rubbed his cock up and down in the resulting small\nopening, before thrusting forward and making the first penetration.  \"Ooooo, yeah,\"\nLester murmured happily as he felt the hard head wedge its way into his ass.  The tightness\nand slickness of the pretty pink and white ass felt great to Martin too. He\ncould have masturbated, and he had done so after the breakup with his\ngirlfriend, but it had been very unsatisfactory. Even covered with lubricant,\nhis hand was hard and dry, and what he wanted was something soft and tight and\nslick. That was when he was told of the availability and talent of Lester, and\nhow the young gay man was eager to have sex with the other men in the dorm.\nSkeptical and reluctant at first, he was glad he had decided to see if what he\nheard was true.", "related": ["B00GMX514O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the vision, the Pope sees an imminent global tribulation. The Ark is the remnant's only means of survival. The Remnant sets out to establish the Ark. If the tribulation occurs, most of the world's civilian population would be exterminated, preparing the way for the Antichrist.\"Throughout the story, several prophecies are intricately woven. The politics of socialism are demonized, literally. And the final unity of the Church is accomplished, with Russia emerging as central to Christendom's final stage.\"This book will appeal to a wide, general audience, because even if you're not Christian, the possibility of the world's ruling elites getting together and coordinating a global EMP attack that would wipe out 70 or 80% or more of the little people, like you and me, is a very real possibility. What defenses do we have? How do we prepare? How can we escape?\" Amazon Review by Julie Musick\"The title 'The Last Ark' peeked my curiousity after reading 'The Harbinger' and 'Marketing of Evil' and I was not dissappointed. Highly recommended. Full of action and intrigue.\" Amazon Review by M. Zeltner\"This read is well worth the effort. I was not let down. The overall prophetic tone made for the most plausible end-of-the-world scenario I have ever read. This could be your ticket to escape. You won't be disappointed.\" Amazon Review by Cristian Cordella\"The is a great read, I thought it was bold and full of surprises - especially the end of this first part.

An introductory textbook that presents in an engaging and accessible style, geography's unique approach to environmental issues. Highly recommended.”—Judith Carney, UCLA“This is a refreshing and engaging book which focuses on the real core of geographical study - understanding the relationships between people and environment. The structure of the book is innovative for an introductory text, and students will particularly appreciate the many links which are drawn between theory and practice, and which are illustrated very effectively through an impressive range of case studies. The authors should be commended on producing a book which really does break new ground in its objectives, structure and content.”—Tony Binns, University of Otago, New Zealand“A long-overdue textbook that is at once comprehensive while remaining accessible. The authors have done an impressive job at synthesizing an enormous amount of material and perspectives with a clarity that is refreshing and engaging. It will provide students with a guide to this dynamic sub-field and demonstrate how critical inquiry using this approach will enable them to address important and complex issues in the contemporary world. Including clear chapter objectives, critical questions, tables, and ‘icebreakers’, the book provides necessary background materials while also demonstrating how research is lived experience by those conducting it.”—Antoinette WinklerPrins, Johns Hopkins University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With the murder hatchet found in his car, which was seen near the Plantation on the night of the killing, the quarrelsome Quint looks anything but innocent. Soc learns that Quint's trouble began soon after he discovered exploitation of Indian artifacts uncovered on Cape Cod.

Su estreno “oficial” en el mundo romántico español tuvo lugar en abril de 2011, de la mano de “Princesa”, una novela que aborda el controvertido asunto de la diferencia de edad en la pareja, y que ha enamorado a las lectoras. Han sido sus apasionadas recomendaciones y su permanente apoyo, las que han convertido a “Princesa” en un éxito, y a Dakota, su protagonista, en el primer héroe romántico creado por una autora española que cuenta con su propio Club de Fans en Facebook. En noviembre de 2012, Princesa ganó el I Premio Pasión por la Novela Romántica en la categoría Tres Plumas a la Mejor Novela Romántica Digital Autoeditada.  En dicho mes, asimismo, “Princesa” fue nominada en tres categorías, Mejor Novela, Mejor Autora Chicklit y Mejor Portada en el marco de los I Premios Chicklit España. Patricia también es autora de la serie romántica Sintonías, compuesta por “Bombón” (2007), “Primer amor” (2007) y “Amigos del alma” (2008), de la que existe una edición formal (con ISBN) desde septiembre de 2012.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.The Critics RaveThe New York Times says that his \"roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography.\" Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that \"After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man.\"NPR calls his work \"adventurous and enormously engrossing...\" and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: \"If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker.\"The Story Teller's StoryAs a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.Explosive Page-Turning AdventuresThe exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.\nIn recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing \"seminars.\" James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)", "related": ["B00DOM12E4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Blackmail, an old secret, and a tragic shipwreck combine to\nmakeSinking Shipsa fascinating and well-written mystery. This is the\nfirst in a series of Abishag mysteries and, having read the excerpt included at\nthe end for the next one,Indelible Beats, I am eager for it. Not to be\nmissed! Pendrifter book review It's a testament to\nMs. Knowlden's writing that she can take a speculative element like the Abishag\nwife, wrap it in a mystery, and still make you believe this story can exist in\nthe real world. A large part of it has to do with the characters, especially\nthe protagonist. Leslie is a compulsive rule-follower with a streak of inward\ndefiance, a detached professional who forms a sentimental bond with her dying\nhusband.  These contradictions make her all at once human and all at once\nfascinating.  The heart of this book is really her (non-romantic)\nrelationship with Thomas.  It's surprising that she can form any kind of\nbond with a comatose man, let alone such a tender one.  The scenes where\nLeslie interacts with Thomas are some of the best in the book. Flight\nof the Red Dragonfly book review", "related": ["B00G06W3SA"], "rank": 1571947, "title": "Indelible Beats: An Abishag's Second Mystery (Abishag Mysteries Book 2)", "author": "Michelle Knowlden", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Angelisa Stone is a typical Midwestern wife and mom, frazzled by parenting and housework, and overwhelmed with sports schedules, doctor appointments, and three-dimensional creative projects due “tomorrow morning.”  Angelisa dreams of white sandy beaches, clear-blue waters, and Midori coladas in hand, but realizes that her loving husband and four not-so-perfect children are her real dreams-come-true.  Writing and reading are her passions, and she hopes (and prays with her fingers tightly crossed) that readers will find enjoyment and escape through her words and characters.

The fact that the main modules are reviewed and\nrecapped makes picking up the major points very easy. This is one good and well\norganized program.

No way could I learn anything\nfrom this guy.\" A few hours later I have my tail firmly placed between my legs.\nBoy am I glad I changed my mind.

I've picked up at least a dozen gold\nnuggets from it, and I haven't even completed the 5th chapter as of writing\nthis review. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

Orphan Jonathan Palmer has waited 15 years for this day. Today, he will sneak out of the Anglican school for boys that has been his home for as long as he can remember, steal away in the night and set off to find his British mother and the truth about his past. All he has left of his mother is a locket that he has been told was hers, containing a single lock of blonde hair. He stows away on one of Britain's Flagships with the help of his friend Peter, hoping to get passage to England so that he might begin his search. The journey is soon plagued by bad omens, including black cats and the old sailor saying of \"Red Sky in the Morning, Sailors Take Warning.\"Lorraine Carey does a wonderful job of showing you what's happening, rather than just telling. You actually see the blazing sunrise and feel the cool drops of water rising from the sea. The cover was bold, beautiful, and eye-catching. The cover art is a huge deciding factor in many books from children to middle grade to Young Adult range, and this cover is an excellent choice. It's alluring in just the right way and I'm sure kids will want to know more. While the story was short and sweet, it sure didn't lack in the entertainment factor. Nothing quite beats the action and adventure of a dangerous sea voyage and the mysterious quest of a wayward orphan. A wonderful book that I'm sure the younger young adults will eat right up!", "related": ["B00IX5SEUM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
