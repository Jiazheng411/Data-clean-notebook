Eddie and Jake both play for the Buckman Badgers in the sixth-grade baseball championship; after she chokes in the first game, he decides to practice with her for the good of the team. Meanwhile the community yard sale Mrs. Hatford has volunteered to host falls on the same day as their playoff game. She enlists a reluctant Wally to take over until she returns, and Caroline sees helping him as an opportunity to talk him into acting with her in a play she's writing for their fourth-grade English class. When the girls find a photo album full of humiliating pictures of the boys, Caroline blackmails Wally to keep his word about being the husband in her play. A subplot about two relatives of Amelia Bloomer trying to steal a framed picture from Wally's house before the sale opens provides suspense but strains credulity. It turns out the frame hides her original bloomers. Still, this is a fast-paced read, and fans of the series will welcome it. It should also interest baseball fans, especially girls, since there is plenty of action on the field.Tina Zubak, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dido gets involved in a plot by an exceedingly evil werewolf-Baron fresh from 15 years incarceration in the Tower of London. The Baron connives to place his own son on the throne of England, rather than Dido's friend Simon. Energetic, imaginative characterization, suspense, and superb timing drive the story to a satisfying conclusion. Although titles in the \"Wolves\" series may be read independently, readers of the earlier books are the best audience for this romp of a Victorian parody.

Full of lower Manhattan's eccentricities, this captivating debut peeks in on the family of a late rock icon, Ree Hollander, in its West 10th Street townhouse. His widow, Sadie, met the rocker after ditching college for a less conventional education in swinging London. A doting mother, Sadie is a dedicated drinker, whose thirst for vodka has grown since her eldest, Gretchen—the only child old enough to know Ree before he overdosed at 39—checked into a Connecticut mental institution for self-mutilation. The adolescents, Ondine and Hamish, eschew public school for lessons from their bohemian neighbors. Also afloat in this quirky sea are London-based Brian, Rees best friend and bandmate whos lusted after Sadie since Rees death 12 years ago, and Capn Meat, a genteel bum and Vietnam vet who guards the children from less savory street characters. When a near-fatal motorcycle accident sends Sadie back to London, this unlikely circle tightens around the Hollander kids. Blending a local's familiarity with a first-timer's awe, Keenans portrait of Manhattan is vividly drawn, an insightful illustration of how a string of city blocks can feel like home.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Josh investigates and discovers that the frog’s extra leg may be caused by contamination in its pond, but before he can get the frog’s body to an interested scientist, it is confiscated by the school principal. Pederson’s full-page illustrations ramp up the comedy and action, and Donovan ably shows how the school world of kids is separate and little understood by the adults. Joshua, a talkative kid who has been pegged as something of a troublemaker, is also convincingly portrayed. A subplot involving Josh’s efforts to learn about the personality of his birth father seems tacked on, but this is a minor quibble with a novel that many young readers will enjoy as much for its picture of grade-school life as for its ecological message.

With admirable timing, this volume examines a global workplace infrastructure that's as shaky as the economy would indicate. Taking a hard line against exploitation of workers in a variety of roles worldwide, Ross looks closely at workers on the verge, and those putting them there. In the chapter \"China's Next Cultural Revolution?\", he warns that \"Beijing's rulers have nothing to worry about\" so long as \"the creative sector behaves like other industries... They can be groomed and promoted... to absorb foreign investment and foreign ideas, to exploit low production costs....\" He tackles the Western world with the same nonplussed tone, as when discussing corporate PR tactics to deny ties to labor abuses by promoting social good, naming names like Nike, Reebok and the Gap. He also hits higher education, where much of the workplace is shaped, noting that it's \"all too easy to conclude that the global university, as it takes shape, will emulate some of the conduct of multinational corporations.\" Rejecting the widely influential, free marketeer notion of a worldwide \"playing field,\" Ross leaves no room for easy answers (or an \"alternative, and equally snappy, image\" to answer Thomas Friedman's or Richard Florida's).

Much of this narrative does a great job in making you feel as though you were some silent observer standing in the shadows...The plot is well crafted; it takes a while to boil up but once the \"scream\" starts off the adventure the pace is dramatic. Lots of red herrings and false clues make it difficult to piece together the best suspect. Always a sign of a well thought out structure.

The broader terrorist plot is an awkward graft onto the story of Marva Dobbs, a 62-year-old African-American woman who runs a successful Paris soul food restaurant. Marva's active libido leads her into a relationship with a new cook, 28-year-old Algerian Hassan Mekachera, but Hassan disappears after a bombing and becomes a suspect. When Marva herself vanishes, her daughter, Naima, and her Breton husband, Loïc Rose, begin a quest to find her. More rewarding than the thriller aspect is Lamar's insider view of American expatriates in contemporary Paris.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The late Monsieur Dupont's widowed daughter-in-law enlists the two Paris policemen when the family's servant girl, Jeannette Moineau, is accused of the poisoning—a charge Mademoiselle Dupont considers absurd. The investigation moves forward, but another death soon follows. With a light, literate hand, Alleyn includes a wealth of detail about life in France during the Republican period, while ratcheting up the tension with every chapter.

The Masters are described in the introduction as a large group of senior souls at Home on the Other Side. Apart from commentaries by Peter Watson Jenkins, the book largely follows a question and answer format. The Masters themselves are well aware of the caution most people will bring to reading a channeled book, and they address such skepticism directly and kindly in their opening chapter.The scene is then set for their discussion of healing with a thumbnail sketch of incarnation as seen from the perspective of the Other Side. Each person s soul is placed in relation with its body to experience physicality. This experience will include disaster, disease, and death. But souls have the ability to reject viruses and genetic predisposition to have disease. This is true for children as for adults. Some situations, such a receiving wounds in battle, may have been chosen in advance by the soul as lessons. Likewise, experiences such as chronic pain may represent energetic blockages that must be eliminated at the soul level.There follows a discussion of the process of healing. Self-healing may depend on the purpose of the disease, which sometimes represents a challenge that cannot be met during one s lifetime. Where healing is possible, the ideal way is for the soul to heal itself by its intention and with the aid of the universal life-force. Various diseases are outlined. The healing process may be facilitated by others, and the Masters deal at length with the options available to the soul through many different types of healing methods. The specific issue of weight control is also discussed.The Masters look at the Soul s creative power to hold the intention to heal, and to find effective ways to do so. They see meditation as useful in helping the individual soul to communicate with other souls in the universe, thus bringing balance and wisdom into its life. With the issue of prayer their cosmic attitude differs sharply from traditional teaching and practice on Earth. They explain fully their viewpoint both in terms of praying for ourselves and for others, and they do so referring to the whole incarnation experience of the soul. In addition to an explanation of the positive nature of universal healing energy, the Masters conclude the book by reviewing twelve scriptural texts and prayers to demonstrate what they see as effective prayer.--The Publishers", "related": ["B00B0N10IC"], "rank": 876741, "title": "Healing with the Universe, Meditation, and Prayer", "author": "Peter Watson Jenkins", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of my family not to mention most of the people I know; have no ideas of my background. My life was always kept private along with some of our family back ground. In saying this my adopted grandfather was a big part of my life even to this day. (Stephen Harry walker) my adopted grandfather was not just a factory worker he was a carpenter, a fisherman and a inventor as well as other trades, He at one time had 3 patents (Stephen) had invented in the mid 1950s a carburetor that was able to get 50 mpg on a 8 cylinder motor, as well as the roll out awning on most RVs driving around today. His brother John Vocola had invented a plastic washer to go over the top of a battery post to stop corrosion today it is a felt washer and sold in all the WalMarts. My grandfather, on my mother's side ran a projector for outside movies on weekends and also was an inventor and invented a filament for a projector that was able to run all night without burning up as well as other stuff. And as for me, I was very fortunate to know my adopted grandfather (Stephen Harry walker) and on like most kids during the summers I spent time in Indiana with grandpa in his work shop I was running a belt disk sander & a drill press at age of 8 years making wood toys & a table saw at age of 9 and I was the only one grandpa let operate his radio arm saw, in the summer of 1968 I was 10 (Stephen Harry walker) past away this year in the winter of 1968. I am very proud to have my dad Jack L Michael who's open mind gave me the opportunity to grow up knowing Stephen Harry walker, John Vocola and my mothers first Husband Joe Warner whose part was creative electronics , these are the people that gave me the motivation to be how I am today. And saying this I always thought this was the greatest country In the world for the reason you did not have to go to school to learn or receive a education, all you had to do was apply for a job of interests and learn hands on. You might not make a lot of money but after all you took the job for the education.

Her next publications were The Jingle Book and The Story of Betty (1899), followed by a book of verse entitled Idle Idyls (1900). After 1900, Wells wrote numerous novels and collections of poetry. She wrote a total of more than 170 books. During the first ten years of her career, she concentrated on poetry, humor, and children's books. According to her autobiography, The Rest of My Life (1937), around 1910 she heard one of Anna Katherine Green's mystery novels being read aloud and was immediately captivated by the unraveling of the puzzle. From that point onward, she devoted herself to the mystery genre. Among her most famous works are: Patty at Home (1904), Marjorie's Busy Days (1906), The Gold Bag (1911), Marjorie's Maytime (1911), Marjorie at Seacote (1912), Patty Blossom (1917), Vicky Van (1918) and Patty and Azalea (1919).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nelson was born in a little farmhouse on the prairie in eastern North Dakota in 1944. Some doctors made house calls back in those days. He remembers kerosene lamps, bathing in a large galvanized tub, and their phone number was a long ring followed by four short ones, and everybody in the neighborhood could rubberneck. (Imagine that today!) James has been telling stories most of his life. Some of his first memories happened during recess in a one-room country schoolhouse near Walcott, ND. His little friends, eyes wide, would gather round and listen to his every hastily-imagined word.  It was a beginning.  Fascinated by the world beginning to open, he remembers listening to the teacher read to all twelve kids in the eight grades. He was living in that same house on the land originally homesteaded by his great grandfather, when a savage tornado hit in 1955 and destroyed everything. They rebuilt and his family remained until the early nineteen-seventies when diversified farming began changing to industrial agribusiness (not necessarily a good thing.) He spent four years in the US Navy during the Vietnam War (USS Carbonero and USS Archerfish, both submarines.) After the navy he worked many jobs and finally has settled on a few acres exactly two and one half miles straight west of  the original farmstead, ironically likely the very spot where the 1955 tornado first struck, which sometimes gives him a spooky feeling. A little more Biography: He lives among goldfinches, chickadees, nuthatches, blue jays, crows, cottontails, squirrels, deer, mink, badgers, coyotes, wallflowers, spiderworts, sunflowers, goldenrod, big and little bluestem, switchgrass, needle & thread grass, June berries, chokecherries, oaks, willows, boxelders and cottonwoods, in the outback of eastern North Dakota.", "related": [], "rank": 2058709, "title": "Pharmacological Research Gone Berserk: Needed: Volunteers", "author": "James W.

Perhaps this is the first post-modern dictionary in which the dictionary becomes an art form.”\"An important addition to any Antarctic collection.\"This is more than just a good glossary.

The work's satirical style, which focuses on the different kinds of power that individuals exercise over one another, follows in the footsteps of Jonathan Swift and paves the way for Jane Austen.

There's something amazing about the written word. It's so challenging to craft a story that's visually compelling, but that's my passion. Drawing a picture that makes viewers see detail I want them to see is easy because it's right there in front of them, no room for interpretation. But with words, imaginations can be sparked as the pages come to life, so even if I picture a scene a certain way, readers may view it entirely differently, as their imaginations take what I intend or describe and blend it with their own vision. I'm an extremely visual person and I'm also compelled by film. So when I write, I envision each scene in detail, the depth of the space, the layout of a room. I hear the dialogue and I imagine how each character shapes the words, how they stand as they speak in relation to other characters and the world I'm creating around them. It's like nothing else I can describe; and the satisfaction that comes from putting everything together and seeing a story really come alive while having the opportunity to infuse the plot with hope and faith, I couldn't ask for more. \" Tim began writing and drawing early on, making his own comic books, then selling them to his classmates and neighborhood kids. He continued drawing through high school and was honored with many awards including ACSI Best of Show and Ohio All-State honors. His writing had usually been limited only to short stories, but as his mother fell ill, he found himself writing pages, then chapters, and finally drafts of what would become Lucky 13 and The Legend of the Blade. As cancer confined her to bed, Tim wrote to entertain her. She became his inspiration. Upon her death, he committed to finishing the two books in her honor and now continues to write driven by his passion for the written word.

After a brief introduction surveying the scope of the subject, the core of the work is comprised of alphabetically arranged entries from Achelous to Zeus. Entries vary in length from a short paragraph on lesser-known subjects to several pages on classic texts and monumental gods and heroes. What distinguishes this volume is its shift in focus away from the exploits of the Olympians to ancient authors and literature. While only a handful of black-and-white images dot the landscape, this work will be a worthy addition to collections.Brian Odom, Pelham Public Library, AL© Copyright 2010.

Perhaps without conscious realization, he re-affirms the missionary psychology of another Pontiff - John Paul II, in his confirmation that \"Justice is not enough!\" For John Paul, as for Wheatley, Charity continues where justice ends.As for Munus Africae, Benedict describes the African world view in Part III, (Art.69) of his document as follows:\"This great openness of heart and spirit in the African tradition predisposes you, brothers and sisters, to hear and receive Christ's message, to appreciate the mystery of the Church, and thus to value human life to the full, along with the conditions in which it is lived.\"Congratulations to Ron Wheatley for his independent presentation of a missionary perspective, affirming in advance that to which Benedict exhorts us - The message, the mystery, the value of human life, and the conditions in which it is lived.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His friend Tony thinks the solution to his dilemma is to get to know Serena, a pretty girl with a history of straight A's. If McKay can convince her that he likes her, then he'll have the help he needs and Tony can flirt with her two friends. Everything works beautifully until Serena uncovers the plot, and her friends become enemies when Tony turns out to be a less-than-suave boyfriend. McKay's grade improves, but he takes no satisfaction from all the effort without Serena to share in his success, because he really does like her. He also has to deal with his little brother who shares his room and keeps getting into all his stuff, and parents who just don't seem to understand that an eighth grader needs a room of his own. Rallison uses humor and realistic characters to bring the boy's problems to a satisfying conclusion. The protagonist is genuine, honest, and endearing without being sappy or pathetic next to the more Casanovalike Tony. Plus, this book is really funny. It should be a hit with anybody interested in boys, girls, baseball, friends, and that mysterious world of a first crush.Linda Bindner, formerly at Truman State University, Kirksville, MOCopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0067MSQEC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I confess it took me 30 years (although not sweating profusely at the keyboard each and every day) to finish Chip.  A second book is in the works - expect to see Cold, Cold Heart on the shelves in the fall of 2013. And a third is already in planning. Cold, Cold Heart is a mystery based on the true story of a woman who bears an illegitimate child in 1942 Panama and subsequently disappears without a trace.

I hope that you will do the same, to build\non the areas of your knowledge, and to understand the areas where you\nneed to develop to master all of the key areas of photography.I\nencourage you to use all available resources to learn about photography.\n These quiz books will test your skills, but you will need to consult\nother sources of knowledge to learn and understand some of the concepts\nincluded in the quiz questions.

Virginia Suzanne Ballard is 28 years old, eight months pregnant and not at all sure she wants to leave her family and move \"North\" (to Richmond) with her young lawyer husband. When stricken with toxemia, Ginny Sue is tended for a week by three generations of her family's women: Her favored grandmother Emily and great-aunt Lena, cantakerous and large-hearted widows not always willing to distinguish between past and present; her mother Hannah with her cousin Madge; and her own contemporary cousin Cindy, a brash and vulnerable, quick-spoken divorcee. Conversation among the women is woven of memories and half-remembered recollections, current misunderstandings, wishes, disappointments and a dark secret concerning Cindy's father, a Chevrolet salesman with an Egyptian obsession., With a sure touch and impeccable comic timing, McCorkle leads her characters to revelations and emotional relief during an afternoon when a tornado adds its own bit of havoc. As the family's history emerges from a flood of interrelated experiences, the narrative achieves coherent drama. This novel confirms McCorkle's place among other talented Southern storytellers. 25,000 first printing.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0053181HU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the body is found, Joseph's colleagues try to involve him in the investigation. Although he refuses, old habits die hard, and little by little he is pulled into the action. The victim, a former inmate at the hospital, had been buried alive, drugged and with her mouth glued shut. Two more victims, also buried alive, are discovered and official suspicion settles on the personnel and inmates of the Gothic hospital. Becoming more involved, Joseph must successfully navigate his way out of the Castle, with its surreal passages and abandoned wings, and discover its secrets in order to solve the case and emerge with a new life. John's focus on atmosphere and images of suffocation make the most of an essentially routine mystery.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.7, "rating_total": 47.0}

Wrage was born, 1956 on Long Island New York. Writing is something that has always been a part of Wrage’s adult life, as keeping journals and writing light hearted short stories of Wrage’s experiences have been on going.  The first novel Wrage completed, What Darkness Lay Within, which is a fiction, suspense/thriller; was originally started about fourteen years ago but never completed until June of 2012. In Sept. 2011, when Wrages life abruptly changed, thus causing Wrage to contemplate the direction for future writings, it was at that time the book writing commenced. The book took nine months to bring to completion.  Wrage is about to release a compilation of short chiller tales, within one book. Wrage has another novel underway which is also fiction but of a completely different nature. Wrage writes various articles and columns for newspapers and blogs, along with a variety of short stories and children’s books.

The changes in the 20th century have been the most seismic: the age-old stability of belief has been largely swept away along with 'high art'. Now, anything goes, with 'ugliness as valid as beauty, and formlessness as valid as form'. Most of all, this invigorating gallop through the centuries makes you set off for the galleries. --Rachel Redford, The OldieNaxos AudioBooks have done art an immense service with the publication of this splendid audiobook which is a must purchase for any of those who are interested in western art in general. Sebastian Comberti has already lent his inimitable voice to Jan Morris's Venice, to my mind one of the most beautifully nostalgic [titles] in the Naxos AudioBooks series focused on culture. Here we get a totalitarian perspective of western art from the very early beginnings up to the present day, with Comberti describing the various stages of development in an extremely romantic manner. We hear about Greek art and sculpture, Roman architecture and the journey of Christian art which created the incredible plethora of artists in the Middle Ages and the Baroque. One is transfixed and sits down to listen almost spellbound with Comberti's detailed and fastidiously created descriptions. This is an audiobook to thrill and for those who love culture, it surely is a must have. --Gerald Fenech, Malta News Online", "related": ["B00EZYZ2QY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, when I look in the mirror I often see a woman much different than the one they describe.  At times I see myself as the Flint, Michigan native who has often been sadden by a life that many would envy, consumed by day to day responsibilities, slowly dying inside and lost in a world of monotony.

I am a woman who recently decided that it was time to take off the mask and let the world see me for who I truly am. Who is Nicole P.

Hanks has appeared on numerous television and radio programs, including National Geographic’s Paranatural, the History Channel’s Guts and Bolts, CNN Radio, The Jeff Rense Program, and a variety of other shows and podcasts.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He first learned how to teach swimming as a freshman at Evanston Township High School, Evanston, IL.  Their learn-to-swim station program was copied by many other high schools at the time.      He went on to become a 5-time All-American swimmer at Indiana University coached by famed mentor, Doc Counsilman.  From Doc, he learned how to apply physics principles to his swimming instruction.    After completing his Master’s Degree at IU he became the Director of Aquatics and head swim coach for Maine West High School and the City of Des Plaines, IL park district.  He taught numerous student instructors employed by the park district for their Saturday and summer swim school programs.      Four years later he entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Toledo. Three months into the program his wife gave birth to triplet boys and completed a three year degree program in two years.  For his dissertation he tested the 1972 United States Men’s Olympic Swimming Team as subjects. His major emphasis was in Perceptual-Motor Learning and Sport Psychology or how we best learn motor skills, and went on to coach All-American collegiate women and high school boys.    With the power of physics and psychology of learning principles, he created a unique learning system of six methods unlike any program or instructor as the new science of swimming instruction. He noted that major programs do not reach enough people, and created a simple system starting in the home without a pool that could help save more lives worldwide.   To practice what he preached, he started to compete again in the Masters and Senior Olympic swimming programs.  After several years of hard training using his own principles for efficient technique he set national and world records.  To date he has won 16 Senior Olympic Gold Medals.   In June of 2008 he retired as a school superintendent, wrote and published his first book, PURPOSEFUL INTENT, to learn intrinsic motivation using three inter related skills known as The Triad Performance Improvement System used by most all top performers.  This work is now being turned into a co-authored book series with experts in their fields.   TEACH YOURSELF TO SWIM LIKE A PRO IN ONE MINUTE STEPS, is the new science of swimming instruction.  Dr. Pete has the credentials, education, and experience to provide this content-rich information everyone should know and have as a resource to keep their families safe.", "related": ["B00C44YSA8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Old Injun fighter Kelly, now 50 and goutish, is still searching for \"a decent seegar and a warm, willing woman.\" T. R., as assistant secretary of the Navy, taps Kelly to recruit Rough Riders, ruffians to be officered by Ivy Leaguers. Among Kelly's enlistees are Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In Cuba, the Kid leads T. R.'s horse up San Juan Hill after the Riders refuse to follow Teddy into battle. Remaining episodes become thinner and thinner as Kelly escapes ambushes by Boers in South Africa and by Igorote tribesmen in the Philippines. He and his latest flame, Lucretia, survive a shipwreck during a typhoon and, as the book ends, the two seem intent on settling down on a California farm.

Chillemi's most recent\noriginal paperback,The\nComplete Herbal Guide: Heal Your Body Naturally and Maintain Optimal Health\nUsing Alternative Medicine, Herbals, Vitamins, Fruits and Vegetables(December 2012) debuted at # 1 on Amazon's best-seller list\nand has been rated five stars from numerous\nreaders who purchased the book. Chillemi's first\npublished book, Epilepsy You're Not Alone in 1998, helped millions of people\nunderstand and cope with their disorder enabling them to live a happy, healthy\nand productive life. Since that time, Chillemi has published numerous non-fiction\nand fiction books including The Complete Herbal Guide: A Natural Approach to\nHealing the Body, Epilepsy and Pregnancy: What Every Woman Should Know, Co-authored\nby Dr. Blanca Vasques, M.D., Faith, Courage, Wisdom, Strength and Hope, Natural Cures for Common Conditions and The Secrets of Happiness\nand Success: The Power Of Positive Thinking.Her\nlove affair with non-fiction and with health genre in general, began during her\njunior year of college when she was having faced by numerous obstacles due to\nher epilepsy disorder. Hoping and\npraying that she would be able to finish college and not let her epilepsy\ndisorder get the best of her, she decided to research her disorder hoping to\nfind out more about her disorder and ways to cope with it. Sadly,\nthere were not many books written about epilepsy during that era. The few books written were by doctors and the\nmedical terminology flew right over your head.Determined to find the answers to my questions,\"How can I graduate college when I am constantly having seizures?\",\n\"How can I become a success in life and not let epilepsy destroy my hopes and\ndreams?\", \"How do people with epilepsy cope with their disorder?\"I\ndecided to write an article to epilepsy foundation and asked them to publish\nit. I wanted to learn how others coped\nwith their disorder. I received hundreds\nof letters from all over the United States and Canada. I decided to use the\nknowledge I gained to help myself and\nothers by writing a self-help book called, Epilepsy You're Not Alone.Writing that book changed my life.Letters poured out from readers thanking me for writing the book. I never realized how powerful words could\nbe. My greatest gift was not figuring\nout how to help myself, it was being able to help others who struggled from the\nsame problem. There is no greater gift\nin life than the gift of giving. I\ngraduated college, received an Associate's Degrees in Business, and then went\non to receive a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising, but in the end, I\nchanged my career choice to journalism. I graduated Richard Stockton College in\n1996. I\nbegan writing seriously in 1994, penning the manuscript that would become Epilepsy\nYou're Not Alone. I held many jobs\nduring those first years as a writer, finally settling in (much to our delight)\nto write full time in 2000.Chillemi is an active member of her community and helps\norganizations in New Jersey. Shehas written\nfeatures for journals and newspapers. Her articles have appeared in dozens of\nnewspapers and magazines in North America and abroad. She won an award from the\nEpilepsy Foundation of America in 2002 for her help and dedication to people\nwith epilepsy.Born\nin 1972, Chillemi was born in New York and lives in New Jersey with her husband\nMichael, and their three children, Michael, Alexis and Anthony. The family pets\ninclude two Shih Tzu's, Rocco and Princess, and two birds Elmo and Tweedy.When\nshe is not writing, Chillemi chases after his three Shih Tzu's, takes long\nwalks, hits the gym, and goes to all her kids' football, soccer, wrestling,\nbasketball and cheerleading practices and games.", "related": [], "rank": 1167327, "title": "The Complete Herbal Guide: A Natural Approach to Healing the Body - Heal Your Body Naturally and Maintain Optimal Health Using Alternative Medicine, Herbals, Vitamins, Fruits and Vegetables", "author": "Dr. Michael Chillemi D.C.", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.3333, "rating_total": 26.0}

If you are looking for a book to curl up with\nthis holiday season this is one I highly recommend! ~ Lori Caswell  The whirlwind of tragedy, love and greed circling the\nreluctant spiritual heir of Sullivan\n Island's root women at\nthe center of Visions of Love pulled me into this masterfully woven story with\neach page. Joyce and Jim Lavene's novel zooms in on the cracks through which\nselfishness can sneak into our highest motives. The authors never lose sight of\nlove's ability to bring us back home before the cracks get too wide. There is\nplenty in Visions of Love for everyone from a thrill chaser to a spiritual\nseeker to a hopeless romantic. A worthwhile ride.~ Sebastian Briglia  Madison's\nMiracles is a story of love, family commitment and devotion to the well being\nof children. It is laced with deep seated emotions of past traumas that the\ncharacters must face up to in order to find their true happiness. A well\ncrafted read that brings out the plight and cry for help of children, sprinkled\nwith a tender love story of two hurting souls becoming one.

As a child, she was involved in gymnastics. Then in college, while\n earning her degree in Exercise Science, Kimberly combined her passion\nfor fitness and her newly learned knowledge of Exercise Science and\nnutrition and got herself into peak physical shape. She began competing\nin the Fitness America organization as a national level fitness\ncompetitor. Soon, she began appearing in publications like Oxygen\nMagazine and Muscle and Fitness. Following college, life got in the way\nand she took a break from the stage and fitness modeling.In\n2009, married with a child, while on vacation in Cannes, Kim felt that\nshe got out of shape. She decided to return to the world of competitive\nfitness with a goal of getting in shape without deprivation. Kim began\ncreating healthy recipes that would get her body into top shape for the\nstage, shedding almost 20 pounds (see before/after in photos section).When\n her husband Rob watched her transform her body, he was sold. Rob, a\nself proclaimed vegetable hater, followed Kim's methods, ate her\nrecipes. After dropping almost 40 pounds and getting shredded at the age\n of 43, Rob entered his first local fitness competition and placed\nsecond (see Rob's before/after in photos section). Since then, he's\nplaced in the top 15 out of 100, mostly against guys half his age, and\nhas become a fitness model and contributor for Men's Fitness Magazine\nOnline.A few years later, their daughter, then 13 got inspired\nby her fit parents and entered her first fitness competition for teens,\nplacing second. As an aside, she also hates vegetables, but when Kim\nmade her famous Brussels Sprouts (from her Holy Fit cookbook), her\ndaughter actually asked for a second serving!Together they\ncreated their 90 day nutrition and workout program called Jet Set Body.\nThe incredible Jet Set Body member transformations have been featured in\n Iron Magazine and on Body Buidling.com.", "related": [], "rank": 2655837, "title": "The Jet Set Body Healthy Cookbook: Over 150 Delicious Healthy Recipes To Keep You Fit", "author": "Kimberly Murgatroyd", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She meets Doug Castleberry at her niece's fifth birthday party and because of a mix-up with entertainment characters he comes dressed as Superman, though they had ordered Cinderella. Doug is instantly attracted to Stephanie but she just sees him as a nice guy. Stephanie prefers dating Hawk and Gary. There is trouble at the Rialto Theater where she works trying to renovate it and save it from being torn down. Conrad is her boss and he truly loves the Rialto and all it stands for. Herb is the man they turn to for funding, but he becomes much more than that. All of this connects together as we read and become enmeshed in the romance, the suspense, the everyday funny events, and the everyday problems of Stephanie and her friends.Ute Carbone has written a good book with likeable characters and a good plot. When you read Searching for Superman, you are pretty sure you know the ending right from the start, but it doesn't matter because you want to share in the 'how does it get there' and 'maybe I am wrong about that idea.' Searching for Superman is a quick, light read that will leave you smiling. Ute Carbone's writing pulls us right into the pages of the book and makes it real. Searching for Superman was a feel-good story with an easy to follow plot and very likeable characters. I recommend this to all women who enjoy a good love story with a touch of suspense thrown in. Searching for Superman will make you smile and be glad you took the time to read it.", "related": [], "rank": 3749228, "title": "Searching For Superman", "author": "Ute Carbone", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His epigrams are not so much self-contained pearls as the knife-sharp shards of a shattered mirror--in which we make out the shapes of our selves not in the bits of glass but in the spaces between the fragments.--Thomas Christensen, author of 1616: The World in MotionAs epigrammatist, Tom Farber's a doctor making house calls: checking on our human condition. In his black bag, stethoscope, tongue depressor, and reflex hammer for listening and testing. But also--for mercilessly amused diagnoses--scalpel, razor wire, and garrote. Each, handled deftly, not pain-free, but curative.--Frank Stewart, Editor, Manoa: A Pacific Journal... does more than compact the world into the essence perceived by its idiosyncratic compositor. It also hints at an expansive hidden narrative of sex, death, joy and despair.

Of the musical family with whom she lodges in London, Miriam says it resolved itself into a red-haired child who murders ˜The Carnival of Venice' with the pertinacity of a barrel-organ deprived of its variety. A suggestion that she check out the agony column of the newspaper for a suitable position leads her to a job with a detective agency. Her initial assignment puts her on the trail of an embezzler, sending her to Europe and later South Africa. A surprising amount of dry humor helps compensate for the disappointing ending.

Throughout the years I have come to realize the only thing that I can truly be in control of is me. Or shall I say my actions and how I show up in the world. For me it is all about taking responsibility for how I act, how I treat myself and how I treat others. Wheewwwww, and I won't lie, sometimes it takes everything I have to make a decision to act appropriately. When I do, things always seem to turn out as they should. Funny how that works.!.! ;-) So, here I am publishing information to the world for consumption. I hope what ever words your read of mine and in what ever format you choose to read them in, that they make a difference in your life. No matter how small or large that difference maybe, it will tell me (in a cosmic kind of way) that I have done my job......

C. Hayes takes readers back to the small town of Dixon, Kentucky, where Darci Shelton spends her days running Petal Pushers, always trying to find a way to increase her bottom line. The flower shop is actually located in a house that is haunted by Addie Brown, the former owner who died in the 1940s. A letter arrives addressed to Addie's family, from the descendants of Betsy McGee who fled from the area in fear of her life after the birth of twin girls back in 1905. Turns out Addie was the midwife who delivered those twin girls and the family hopes that they can find out what happened to cause Betsy to run away all those years ago, and what happened to her husband. This is a cozy mystery with a paranormal twist. Tina D.C. Hayes provides an interesting, not so easy to solve mystery where the amateur sleuth gets a bit of help from her resident ghost in figuring out who-dun-it. The characters really make this book shine. Descriptive, well written scenes not only allowed me to visualize the characters and the fixes that they sometimes found themselves in, but provided me with more than a few laughs as well. Great characters, a small southern town feel, along with a paranormal twist create this page-turning read. While this book is the second in the Petal Pushers Mystery series, it can be read as a stand-alone work. Personally though, as someone who read the first book, I recommend reading it as well, especially if you enjoy a great cozy mystery that will keep you guessing and a cast of characters that become friends as you are drawn into their lives.", "related": ["B00LNLVQ9Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Orgel is in the most pleasurable of senses a radical thinker.  Whether his subject is politics or textuality, gender or genre, poetics or performance, he has always asked the most fundamental questions, rethought our most uninvestigated assumptions, and delivered something basic, new, and true--always in the voice of the most delightful conversationalist.  To read _The Authentic Shakespeare_ is to be in the company of one's most articulate and smartest literary companion. -- Leonard Barkan, Princeton UniversityStephen Orgel's original and imaginative mode of historical inquiry has dealt with English renaissance literature on and off the stage for a good many years. This fine and elegantly written book puts right some errors, and adjusts many perspectives, arising from interpretive conceits in a way that is more imaginative and intellectually energetic than most theoretical dallyings. Whether writing of Shakespeare, Jonson, surprisingly on Marlowe, or on issues of authorship, authority, authenticity and plagiarism, he is always pointed, pragmatic, skeptical and wise. All students of English poetry and drama should read it, no matter what their period of concern. -- John Hollander, Yale UniversityWhether writing of Shakespeare, Jonson, surprisingly on Marlowe, or on issues of authorship, authority, authenticity and plagiarism, Orgel is always pointed, pragmatic, skeptical and wise. All students of English poetry and drama should read it, no matter what their period of concern. -- John Hollander, Yale UniversityStephen Orgel's original and imaginative mode of historical inquiry has dealt with English renaissance literature on and off the stage for a good many years.

All students of English poetry and drama should read it, no matter what their period of concern. -- John Hollander, Yale UniversityThis is an epochal collection. Its essays have animated, provoked, and directed the study of the early modern stage for the past thirty years. Each of them startled when it first appeared; some are now canonical, others continue to be controversial. Yet each essay remains exemplary for its erudition, imagination, and sheer elegance-and perhaps most distinctively, for the author's refusal to take any assumption about his subject on trust. -- Margreta de Grazia, University of PennsylvaniaThis impressive collection of fifteen essays by Stephen Orgel, written over an astonishingly creative lifetime, enables us now to savor once again the revisionist delights of The Spectacles of State, Prospero's Wife, Marginal Jonson, Tobacco and Boys, and so many others that have changed our whole way of thinking about the Renaissance stage as architecture and as cultural institution, the acting profession, the task of the editor, and the poetics of spectacle. To revisit this achievement is to stand in admiration of the focus and the breadth of the author's investigation of English Renaissance drama. This book is truly Stephen Orgel's own best monument. -- David Bevington Phyllis Fay Horton Distinguished Service Professor in the Humanities, University of Chicago", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've worked on hundreds of cases and I've met a lot of investigators, scientists, and experts who have spent their lives researching the heights, and deep, deep depths, of the human psyche. But I never met an expert who impressed me more than John: tough, compassionate, experienced, literate, and clearly brilliant. Just the qualities a writer needs to be able to research, and understand, and explain to the reader the unbelievable journey through the mind of the subject of this amazing book. As terrifying as the voyage may be, you couldn't have a better guide than John Espy. You know he'll have your back. And you'll need it.' - Robert A. Leonard, PhD, Professor of Linguistics; Director, Institute for Forensic Linguistics, Threat Assessment and Strategic Analysis, Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, USA 'This journey through a pedophilic cannibal's mind is at once a story for us all and a blueprint for professional psychologists of a human so evil as to cause us all to rethink what our species is capable of. Dr Espy, displaying here superb sharp-eyed empirical research and expressing his findings in a literarily graceful manner, brings out the essence of Nathaneal Bar Jonah, is so real and immediate a way that I found it at times difficult even approaching the pages of this masterly work.' - John Herrmann, former Director of Creative Writing and American Literature, University of Montana 'When John Espy first contacted me I was relieved to find someone who understood exactly where I had been forced to go in the search for my missing childhood friend - into the innermost thoughts of serial pedophiles. By sharing our research John and I were able to put together pieces of a puzzle that no one else had been willing to share. We learned that not only was Nathaneal Bar Jonah a serial pedophile and alleged murderer, but he was also part of an intricate fraternity of pedophiles who shared information and resources to abduct and murder children across the country. John Espy's commitment to telling the truth about Nathaneal Bar Jonah and his associations is a testament to his search for justice in a world where all too often law enforcement acts as if the death of a criminal predicates the ability to find answers for his victims. His research is horrifyingly accurate. This book is a must-read for those who aren't afraid of the truth, especially if the truth results in justice for all.' - Melanie Perkins, Emmy Award-Winning Filmmaker (Best Investigative Journalism) for Have You Seen Andy?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The road didn’t end in Portland, Oregon, but there were many confusing freeway interchanges that a girl from the sticks was ill prepared to deal with. As a result, she has lived in the Portland metro area for over fifteen years and still can’t figure out how she manages to spend so much time in traffic when there’s not a stray sheep or cow in sight.She lives with her partner of thirteen years. Between them, they share three children, two dogs, two cats, two mortgage payments, one sedan, and one requisite dyke pickup truck.

After high school, he attended Community College for two years before being accepted for enrollment to the University of Southern California.  While at USC, he began to feel bored with school, out of place and uninterested; so after one year, he dropped out.   A few years later, he landed a job with a small city just south of Los Angeles where he stayed for thirteen years.  Near the end of his tenure with the City, he got married (for the second time) then decided to pack up his new family and move to Las Vegas.  His first and only son was born approximately thirteen months later. After working one shift as an armed security officer at one of the off strip hotel casinos, he determined that it wasn’t worth carrying a gun for less than ten dollars per hour.  After some introspective thought, he realized that Las Vegas was the “Tip Capital” of the world.  He decided that he needed to find a job that included tips.  He wasn’t great with math so dealer (casino) school was out of the question.  He considered himself too old and fat to be a Valet or Bellman; so he eventually thought that he would drive a taxi until he figured out something else to do.  Derek ended up driving a taxi cab for seven years before he left to sell health insurance.  After experiencing the ups and downs of the insurance business for the next five years, he went back to driving a taxi cab for two more.   Derek divorced his second wife just after his son’s fourth birthday.  He told me that the hardest part of his second divorce was leaving his son behind.  Derek once had a passion for the exotic ladies but has lived with his present girlfriend on and off for the last ten years.He currently enjoys working out four to five days a week and has recently taken up scuba diving.     Derek has revised himself, writing intimately and with vivid frankness, about the unspoken accounts that highlight the curiosity that is Las Vegas.  Eloquently, he describes what many want to experience, but are afraid to undertake – the afterhours of “Sin City”.  Derek is a unique insider, provocative in thought while entertaining his readers as the consummate storyteller.  You will appreciate the zestful nature in this author, blogger and entrepreneur.", "related": ["B00CS6GCX8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this new book, we accompany Michael, as he journeys through a typical day in his university life. It is simply delightful; as interesting and informative, as it is amusing. The content will make it a huge hit with most children on the spectrum, but for me, as the mother of a young man with ASD, it is the glimpse of Michael s successful life that makes it so compelling. From judo to guitar playing to student status, Michael is truly cool and my only beef with this excellent book is that it came to an end far too quickly! --K.I. Al-Ghani, special education teacher and trainer, author of The Red Beast and several books relating to special education for children and adultsMichael Barton has - once again - produced a beautiful and funny book, with his own fresh perspective on the bizarre idioms of the English language, rendering them more comprehensible to people on the autism spectrum. His attractive illustrations break up the text and the result is a gem of a slim book. --Simon Baron-Cohen, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology, Director of the Autism Research Centre, University of CambridgeI loved Michael's book \"It s Raining Cats and Dogs\" and now this book gives us further insight into the complexities of our use of language and how it is assumed we understand the illogicality of ambiguous expressions. The book describes Michael's journey through a day out in London with all the pitfalls of potential miscommunication. The book is witty and fun to read and captures Michael's very positive outlook to life. --Dr Judith Gould, Director, The NAS Lorna Wing Centre for Autism", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thanks for your interest in my book!  I was born into a pastor's home in Michigan, USA and moved to Canada with my family when I was seven years old. -- I didn't have much choice in the matter. :-)  Early in life I made the choice to become a follower of Jesus Christ. That was the most important decision of my life. Since then, things have not always been easy. Because along with the fun and happiness that is my daily existence; life has also at times given pain, challenges, and disappointments. In these times, I have been grateful for God's help and guidance as I have walked through this life.  I attended FaithWay Baptist College of Canada and earned my undergraduate degree in theology. Shortly after that I married a fantastic, pretty and talented girl named Debbie. After working with some of the most dynamic ministries in Canada we settled on Cape Breton Island where I have pastored the good people of Northside Baptist Church for nearly fifteen years now.  Hobbies... That one is tough. My hobby really seems to be whatever I'm doing at the moment, but I probably like carpentry, guitar, my old truck, and technology the best. A few years ago it seemed that God wanted me to use all of the avenues of communication that were available to me to convey the message of the love of Jesus, and make the lives of others just a little brighter. So, this book is a part of that effort. I hope that it is a help and encouragement to you.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
