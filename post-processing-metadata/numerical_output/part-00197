Woodham (history of design, Univ. of Brighton) freely admits that some influences, such as multiculturalism, perestroika, and the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, have been omitted in hopes that this will enhance future studies in these areas. The work reads like a global who's who of designers, architects, cultural and national design organizations, and corporate icons. Each of the ten chapters focuses on a component of design, such as modernism, consumerism, reconstruction after World War II, nostalgia and heritage, and social responsibility. The illustrations fit the text and reflect classic design examples. Woodham successfully highlights design as a powerful marketing tool that has captured the international consumer through culture, socioeconomics, politics, and technology.

But the struggles and longings of these two Tel Aviv–born women who move to Ann Arbor, Mich., when Osnat is in junior high school echo in all of Brown's characters. Efrat is woefully homesick: she moved for her American husband, Marvin, who accepted a teaching job after 13 years in Israel. Osnat seeks kinship from classmate and fellow immigrant Sanjay. The quest for connection is larger than the Greenbergs: in Running, family friend Harriet cements a friendship with an unpopular girl when the two teens concoct—after studying Anne Frank—an escape plan in case Nazis take over America. And then there's Noam, a battle-scarred Israeli soldier who arrives in New York with big dreams, but ends up slinging hummus in a Chicago suburb. He and Osnat wind up together on the night of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. At once openhearted and close-minded, Brown's characters often offend one another when they collide, and their stories capture the awkwardness of both coming to America and coming-of-age.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rendered mostly deaf as an infant, possibly from complications due to his Rh blood incompatibility with his mother, Allred grew up in a fundamentalist polygamist commune in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, founded by his own grandfather who was escaping government persecution for his pluralist beliefs. Infighting among the incestuous group members eventually drove the author's family out, and they settled in Salt Lake City. There the author, who grew to be 6'11\", suffering from asthma, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and equipped with hearing aids, began to excel in high school basketball. Recruited on scholarship to Utah, he played three years under the brutally exacting coach, Rick Majerus, only to feel his sense of self slowly extinguished by the coach's abusive practices. Allred's  voice is humorously self-deprecating and youthfully winning. Frank about his shortcomings (he had to scrounge for professional gigs in Turkey and elsewhere before hitting a spot in the NBA), he delivers an accessible, competent narrative, with highly unusual details about his Mormon roots.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Covering Gray's life from his early beginnings to his untimely death, Demastes (Louisiana State Univ.) delves into the major works of this most self-reflexive of performers with a deft hand. Although this is not a biography per se, it offers significant information about Gray's life and its intersection with his art: close readings of Gray's performances allow one to see how in exposing his personal triumphs and tragedies Gray exposed and analyzed America and Americans. In sum, in dissecting Gray as observer of events, as artist, and as performer--a fascinating approach to the performer--Demastes makes sense of how Gray's monologues worked and what made him original. Including a wonderful personal reflection on Gray by Richard Schechner, this volume provides theater scholars and practitioners with an invaluable introduction to Gray and his work. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All readers. --S. W.

Proving himself to Centurion Lucius Cornelius Macro in the heart of battle against the Germans, Cato earns both his freedom and the respect of his commander. Landing in Britain as part of an expeditionary force, Cato and Macro attempt to foil a traitorous plot involving unbridled political ambitions and a concealed cache of gold.

McMurtry takes his self-effacing tone to an irritating extreme, claiming that he can't remember writing these pieces (most of which he churned out during a stint as a columnist at American Film in the mid-'70s) and that he would have forgotten them entirely if someone hadn't had the idea of putting them into a book. No wonderthere is little memorable here, other than the few efforts that actually live up to the subtitle, in which McMurtry observes the peculiar role of the writer in an industry that values images more than words. McMurtry's novels have served as the basis for some of Hollywood's finest films of the last decades, including Hud (based on his first novel, Horseman, Pass By The Last Picture Show (whose screenplay he co-wrote with director Peter Bogdanovich) and Terms of Endearment, so he is in a choice position to examine the writer's place in the Hollywood machine.

While searching for deeper meaning in the business of child's play, Paley has developed a process for theatrically staging students' own stories, and \"finding the metaphor in the moment\" in order to guide play toward satisfying closure; chronicling her classroom visits to share her process with other educators, her methods prove highly illustrative. Paley explains how people-and not just children-play in order to find characters who represent them, place emotional events in recognizable context, demonstrate their own usefulness, and create common memories for later discussion. Paley also cites interesting literary references throughout, and includes illuminating correspondence between educators. Parents and teachers alike will gain insight from Paley's contemplative, creative approach to play.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gotham's use of a post-hurricane Katrina frame for considering tourism and New Orleans provides an accessible lead-in for most readers, but the historical depth of his study enables him to offer significant theoretical contributions to our ways of thinking about the relationships among \"race,\" tourism, and place, over time.”-American Journal of Sociology,“Authentic New Orleansis a convincing and productive work, which will be fruitful for further research on gentrification within urban studies.”-Thomas Doerfler,University of Bayreuth\"Gotham succeeds most clearly in offering a fresh interpretation of the 1884 World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition and in capturing the complexity of New Orleanians' attitudes about \"authenticity\" at different moments in the city's history. He also offers a compelling analysis enlivened with colorful details, especially for the mid- to late nineteenth century and the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. His work deserves historians' attention for emphatically rejecting one-dimensional, theory-driven analyses that fail to capture the diversity of human agency.\"-The Journal of Southern History,“A seminal social and economic history of tourism and travel promotion in New Orleans, covering nearly two centuries from the early 1800s to the present.Authentic New Orleansshould instantly become a standard case history in the sociology of tourism.”-John Hannigan,author ofFantasy City: Pleasure and Profit in the Postmodern Metropolis“In this remarkable book, Kevin Fox Gotham combines careful historical research, vivid ethnographic observation and sophisticated theoretical insight to produce an indispensable account of New Orleans’ tourist economy, from its earliest origins to the eve of Hurricane Katrina.

Wierzbnik at its peak had 5,400 Jews, of whom 600 to 700 survived the war, and half of these left testimonies in memoirs or others forms. National Jewish Book Award–winning historian Browning (The Origins of the Final Solution) bases his study primarily on survivor testimonies from the slave-labor camps at the Starachowice factory. Willi Althoff, the first commander of factory security whose killings of Jews were theatrically staged and who killed all Jews infected with typhus, was succeeded by pragmatist Kurt Baumgarten, who preferred keeping workers alive to increase factory production and line his pockets by extorting. Nuanced survivor accounts from live interviews, memoirs and archived accounts depicts some Ukrainian guards as sadistic anti-Semites while others were lenient, well-behaved, or corruptible. As the Soviets approached, the Germans deported the slaves to Auschwitz-Birkenau before retreating. Although too specialized for the casual reader, Browning's authoritative, lucid, and subtly analyzed microhistory of a relatively obscure area of Holocaust history will be of considerable value to scholars. 10 photos, maps.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In addition, I realized that some of my friends didn't have cable television, DIRECTV or DISH and couldn't watch the shows. Therefore, I had to share with them what transpired during each season. Sometimes, they would get it, but if they were not fans of the show, the conversation didn't make too much sense. After another downsizing announcement by my employer, I felt compelled to do what I love and that is writing. This is my opportunity to focus on my next career and prepare myself for the next downsizing announcement. I wrote a book over twenty years ago when publishing was different and access to the Internet was not as robust. In today's environment, you can Google anything, find almost anything, and expose your work via many avenues.  If you are a fan of Kandi Burruss, Real Housewives of Atlanta, you know that she needs some drama in her life, and this book will provide her the drama she needs. I enjoy watching the Real Housewives shows and laughed as I wrote my thoughts and perspective on each housewife character.

The woman reminds him a lot of an eight-year-old girl, Grace Harper, who went missing 20 years earlier. Soon after making some indiscreet inquiries, Curzon is stabbed to death by an unknown assailant outside a pub. Meanwhile, PI Harry Lind, a crippled ex-cop, tries to track down a well-known crime czar's brother in-law, who's also disappeared. The two plot threads intersect when Jessica Vaughn, Curzon's friend and fellow reporter, has a boozy flirtation with Lind and persuades him that Curzon's murder isn't the random act of violence that the police assume. Kray captures the cadences and rhythm of underworld life, though some readers may feel some judicious trimming would have speeded up the action in spots. Still, fans of Derek Raymond and Ken Bruen will find much to admire.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After the police fail to make a speedy arrest, the pair agree to investigate quietly on their own. Unfortunately, this is about the last thing they agree on. Mr. Churchill, \"a fat, over-the-hill politician,\" according to Verity, asks Edward to look into a foundation funded by Sir Simon Castlewood, who may be a Nazi sympathizer underwriting projects related to \"racial hygiene.\" Lady Castlewood is a school chum of Verity's, so Verity goes to their home at Swifts Hill, where even a second murder can't make the protagonists see eye-to-eye. As usual, Roberts does a fine job of elucidating the politics of the period, but the cooling of relations between Lord Edward and Verity puts a definite damper on the crime solving.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's a challenge issued by longtime zine supporters Atomic Books and Quimby's to zinesters: make one more issue of their zine in order to combat the demise of the print medium. Print is suffering.

And, as I write this, the ink on the death certificate for the second-largest chain bookstore in the country, Borders, isn't even dry.

She also includes excerpts from Hemingway's writings and quotes from reviewers and critics to illustrate how his work often mirrored or was influenced by his life. This is an objective account, admiring the man's desire to experience life fully and his enormous talent, but also examining his often cruel and erratic behavior, problems with alcohol, and battles with the emotional problems that eventually led to his suicide.

When the police obtain the service’s client list, it will surely spark a bigger Washington scandal.But one FBi investigator suspects this murder is not what it appears. When he threatens to uncover a clandestine plan to overthrow the iranian government, the White House intervenes. Congress debates military action against iran as terrorists plot more attacks.All this takes place during a bitter and hard-fought midterm election as both parties jockey for advantage. Meanwhile, the evangelical right—led by a prominent religious broadcaster and tea Party activists flex their newfound muscle.With war about to reignite in the Persian Gulf, razor thin margins at the polls, and a Washington madam threatening to reveal her high-profile clientele, the only sure thing is the nation’s great uncertainty.Praise for Reed’s previous novel The Confirmation:“Ralph Reed has nailed it in this fast-paced political thriller.

He has also worked on seven U.S. presidential campaigns and advised eighty-eight senate, congressional, and gubernatorial campaigns in twenty-four states. As executive director of the Christian Coalition from 1989 to 1997, Reed was recog- nized for building one of the nation’s most effective grassroots organizations by Newsweek, Life, and Time magazines.

These words written by\nScott, \"authority is best understood and viewed through a relational\nperspective,\" enlarged my understanding and established the journey I took as I\nread this book. In chapter 7 Scott teaches about the relationship between Authority and Worship. I will be\nstudying that chapter for a very long time, it is packed with present Rhema for\nthis hour in the Church.The\nHoly Spirit continues to establish Scott Shafer as a prophetic scribe for this\nage. I believe that many will come to know God and submit to His government as\nthey are challenged by this writer.  Review\nby Pastor Bernard Boulton", "related": [], "rank": 3113704, "title": "Receiving Authority: Compassion, Servanthood, and Listening to the Still Small Voice of God", "author": "Scott M.

It is a useful companion to standard musculoskeletal texts and will be helpful to general and subspecialized radiologists in academic or private practice settings.--Radiology (RSNA)A remarkable achievement...can serve as a reference source...a self-quiz...or it can be used as an authoritative description of all lesions the neuroradiologist may encounter...This is a well-written, attractive, perfectly formatted text that belongs either in the personal library of practicing neuroradiologists or, at the minimum, should be readily available in a sectional or departmental library.--American Journal of NeuroradiologyThis collection of musculoskeletal tumors and tumor-like conditions and their MRI appearances is as comprehensive as one can expect...  Many rare entities are explored and very few are missing.  The book is really two in one.  Following a brief introduction, two sections first show and then tell the MRI world of musculoskeletal lesions... As a first edition, this volume is a heroic task.  Dr. Meyers' atlas is a wonderful addition because of the depth and breadth of examples of MRI lesions covered in the book.  The quality of the MR images is quite good.  Dr. Meyers gets high points for indexing the lesions in this book: the index is superb.  Now that I have this book it will be near me in the reading room and be consulted often, both for diagnostic and teaching purposes.--Douglas N. Mintz, Clinical ImagingThis is an excellent, beautifully illustrated, well-written, very well-organized text of MR bone and soft-tissue tumors.  The image quality is absolutely superb throughout the entire text with 2,976 illustrations... The book is useful for learning MR imaging features, studying for the boards, generating a differential diagnosis, and referencing a particular entity.  This book would be an excellent resource for residents, fellows, radiologists, pathologists, and orthopaedic surgeons.  Any MR image reading room would benefit from a copy of this book.--Academic RadiologyConveniently organized...extensive references to the literature...a practical reference-style text...an excellent resource for the broader medical community...the overall image quality is quite good...particularly useful in a busy referral center...a useful addition...recommend[ed].--AJR[Five stars] [An] image-rich atlas...uniquely structured to facilitate rapid access to a wealth of information...has absolutely no shortcomings...a high-quality book...a wonderful resource for any practicing radiologist or radiologist in training...highly recommend[ed]...without reservation. --Doody's", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And perhaps no question has been more difficult than asking what it's like to live without legs, without testicles, and in some cases without a penis. Captain Tom Bertelsmann had a stoic response: \"You either die from it or learn to live with it. You better learn to accept who you are, now, this different person.\" Bertelsmann lost both legs and both testicles in an IED blast. He is one of more than 200 who have suffered similar wounds in Afghanistan since 2009. Drury uncovers and explores an issue currently weighing on the mind of many a serving soldier--the prospect of losing his manhood in an IED blast. In this fast-paced article soldiers explain in detail how they got blown up, their immediate reactions, and how it's changed their lives. Drury includes the point of view of those who attend the wounded: the surgeons, the physical and psychological rehabilitators, and even a crack team in the Pentagon working on ballistic (bomb proof) underwear, cups, and cod pieces.

Or predicting the\nfuture. I hatched the latter scenario years ago while in Chicago at a\nconference for Amiga computers. The JPEG picture file format was fairly\nnew, and I was hanging out with some programmers who were discussing its\n algorithms, one of which assumes a \"predictive\" cloud of pixels.Years\n later, I rolled that minuscule idea, along with some other hot Amiga\nsoftware technologies like artificial intelligence, into Predictive\nAnalysis. The fictional John Farmer's pet project is an amazing program\nthat is able to predict what someone will type - far into the future.\nJohn works at a corporate behemoth software company with major\nDepartment of Defense contracts, so security is, to put it mildly,\nextremely tight. Showing off his new program to his friend and boss, he\nuses Predictive Analysis to generate computer source code as it would\nlook when finished. And then the fun begins.Imagine getting a\nletter - yeah, I know those are old fashioned. Okay, imagine getting an\nemail from someone who seems to know what you've been discussing in\nemail for the last month, including memos you haven't even typed yet,\nbut plan to. This is what happens, and it gets John and his boss in big\ntrouble. They can't just tell people the program can predict the future.\n Who'd believe that?So they must have hacked into someone's\npasswords and looked at their emailed discussions. That's a security\nviolation, big time. To make matters worse, and more dangerous, John's\nprogram is stolen off the company networks, and the self-improvement\nmodule he added to it multiplies its power in sinister ways. And besides\n that, it can't be stopped. Bring on the donuts, pour the early morning\ncoffee, and make way for a wild ride.Geeks enjoy. I kept it\nshort, so you can get back to your computer games quickly. For everyone\nelse, I've tried to bring the computer jargon down to earth by\ninterspersing blocks of cynical, er, I mean light-hearted Explanations\nof Things Technical.

My novel A Perfectly Natural Act gained royalty publication from G.P. Putnam's in 1973 and was brought out in paperback the following year by Pinnacle.  First Artists was considering an option on it when they went defunct.  The novel would make a rather good movie.  (Maybe I'll write the screenplay one of these days.) Additionally, I've written over fifteen hundred reviews (over a million words in all!) for various Web sites, most notably Amazon and the Internet Movie Database.  Some of my reviews are among the best appearing anywhere (or so I have been told). Over the years I've also written about a dozen book-length manuscripts.  My project now is to present perhaps eight to ten of these manuscripts before the public in book form.

Not a computer, not an electric typewriter, but a then-state-of-the-art manual typewriter. The story ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life.  In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition. Over the years her love of storytelling and curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and has given workshops to writers' groups in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada.  Vanessa and her husband live on Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest with their two Australian Shepherd dogs.", "related": [], "rank": 1587768, "title": "The Colors of Love (USA West Coast Romances  Book 5) eBook", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am more interested in letting you know about stories I create, and those I find entertaining than simply giving myself an ego boost. Fiction is, at its best, the most wonderful thing mankind has ever created. An escape for some, a good dose of hope for others, and for a few, a much-needed remedy for all that ails them. Whether it be genre or literary, short or long, I think there's a part in all of us that needs to hear a good yarn from time to time. Stories of either the fantastic or the realistic. Thrilling suspense or mind-blowing fantasy, to each their own and so on and so forth. Come on in, have yourself a look around, have a seat if you so choose.

Tabitha Grey and her family have moved once again, this time because her father has taken a job as the Keeper (caretaker) of a historic estate/museum. One of the perks of the job is living in the mansion's converted servants' quarters, but Tabitha's mom and little brother rarely leave the flat, and her dad is busy working, leaving Tabitha frequently alone. While many people regularly tour the estate, the home makes Tabitha distinctly uneasy. Before long, her uneasiness turns to full panic as she begins to smell lavender when no one else does, hear sounds no one else hears, and see figures that she believes are ghosts. There is some mystery here, but the story focuses less on the ghosts and more on what happened to the Grey family before moving to Weston Manor. A subplot concerning Tabitha's father's infidelity doesn't add anything to the plot, and her mother's emotional fragility comes across as self-indulgent. The ending takes a Sixth Sense-style twist, somewhat diminishing the impact. Still, this novel might have some appeal to kids who like shivers, but not nightmares.-Heather Webb, Worthington Libraries, OHα(c) Copyright 2013.

Darrel has been a player since he was old enough to know the meaning of the term, as has Rex, his best buddy since childhood. Darrel is a skilled love-em-and- leave-em man, cutting his swath through the clubs, until one night he meets a woman he can't play. Instead, model Brandi Brown plays him. A short courtship in which the body rules the heart, and a shorter marriage follows, till Darrel finds Brandi in their marital bed--with company. That's the end of the marriage for Darrel, but not for Brandi, who continues to taunt him. After a few months of isolation, he's willing to try the scene again, and once again finds a woman who's on the edge of being psychotic. Eventually Darrel determines to find the right woman, one whom he can actually love, for life. His progress to that path is heartwrenching; but finally, ex-player Darrel is determined to keep to the right path. Author Rod Cornelius keeps his readers alternating between smiling and chuckling, nodding our heads in agreement, and tugging at our heartstrings over the sad moves Darrel goes through in his path to true love. His characters are well-developed and the plot races along. Even the unlikable characters get their turn in the sun for character delineation. Single Again is well worth reading, and this reviewer is looking forward to the next novel from Rod Cornelius. ----Annie Haws of Euro-Reviews 1/2007-5 STAR EXCELLENT --Annie Haws of Euro Reviews<br /><br />Single Again-Explosively taking a man from 'pimping' to true love in one fatal dose of laughter! --Akirim Press", "related": ["B00943HWAA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm still trying to fulfill\nmy destiny Goth of being a rich and famous actress. But is that my destiny?As you all know fromFifiandDiary of a Mad Gen YerI'm Fifi and while at times I can be leafy I'm\nnot the least bit beefy. OK now let me introduce you to my 3rd book,Practical Advice from an Evolved Soul.NowPractical Advice...while\nit does have a section in 'My silly blogs' where you get actual advice from 2\nincredibly 'evolved souls' who happen to be my spirit guides Au and Goth, the\nmain focus of this book is, as was the focus ofFifiandDiary,\nis my life.OK so the format is very similar to\nmy previous classicDiary of a Mad Gen Yer, a continuation anthology of\nmy silly stories, silly poems, and silly blogs but there is a little bit of a\ndifference betweenDiaryandPractical Advice.Something called\n'My Silly Tweets.' Now inDiarywhen it was published I really wasn't\ninto this thing called  'Twitter' and now\nI really am. I mean you can go to my user nameFifilaroucheon 'Twitter'\nand spend like half a lifetime finding my specific tweets to this book, or you\ncan read this book.Everything else is pretty similar toDiaryexcept of course a lot of new adventures and poems and blogs sinceDiarycame out.The only thing that has not changed is that I, Fifi Larouche,\nam still a Hollywood actress who works like 99.9 % of the time as a waitress\nwhile looking for those elusive acting roles. I did play a human caterpillar a\nfew weeks ago on a kids TV show a few weeks ago and for pay as an 'extra' in\nlieu of money I got a nice autographed poster by the big shot leading actress\nwho is like 10 years old. Wasn't it so generous of her and, of course, the TV\nshow that hired me. 'Extras' don't get paid a lot of money these days.I'm not going to introduce you to\nany of the characters like last time because that's not really my job and\nbesides if you readDiaryandFifiyou would know who most of\nthem are. I'm just fooling with you.All right quickly there's Biff my on\nagain off again fellow struggling actor boyfriend, Alocki and Helos who are 2\naliens from the planet Zatoris which orbits Alpha Centauri A or is it B? They\nare the smartest people I ever met. There's an evil entity you will meet and\nI'm not gonna go much into describing him; you'll see what he is like. There's\nmy 2 spirit guides Au and Goth, oh you will love my spirit guides and that's\nwhere the title of the book comes from, Au and Goth being the 'evolved souls'\nwho will be giving you 'practical advice' in my 'silly blog' section.Which brings up the point of why the\nblog section is called 'My silly blogs' and why there is not another section\nfor blogs called 'Spiritual blogs written by Au and Goth.' I still wrote the\nblogs as Au and Goth can't write since they are spirit guides. My own blogs are\na bit silly and I didn't want to have 2 blog sections so that's the reason.There's a very poetic character who\ncalls himself'The 200 Year Old Great Writer,' a long dead Englishman who lived\nin the days of romance, of chivalry, and who likes to use words such as 'doth'\nand 'thee' and 'thine.'The remaining major characters as\nyou all remember are my parentsCharles, esteemed Professor of Economics who\nthinks I'm wasting my time inLaLa Land, and Carolyn, Pigg my sister,\nand my favorite bachelor uncle, Uncle Jack.

To hear Wolcott sing Vidal's praises is to succumb to a lament that--with the latter's death--the coffin swings shut on the very last of an era in American literature from which literally no writer has yet risen to carry the torch. Along the way Wolcott offers blistering criticism of reality TV and M.F.A. writing programs and revelatory accolades for those few who wring the most out of celebrity, privilege, and the English language. Rare among the proud micro-genre of literary obituary,The Gore Supremacyis as pleasurable to read as the work of the man it commemorates. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 571986, "title": "The Gore Supremacy (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "James Wolcott", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Emptiness and loss reverberate across the desolate West Virginia landscapes of these working-class lives. Set in the early part of this century, these six stories and a novella have the authenticity and pathos of vintage photographs. From a coal miner whose brother is killed in a mine explosion to a child who struggles to care for his retarded little brother, these characters are limned with compassion and sensitivity. What might veer into the mawkish or maudlin in the hands of a less skillful writer here remains cool and underplayed. In the title story, which resonates with a Spoon River -esque tone, the narrator hides in a church, an outlaw gunned down by a sherriff's posse: \"I am the man who surrendered with one boot gone on St. Valentine's Day, the year of our lord nineteen hundred and thirteen, with the smell of salt and woodsmoke and gunpowder in the air.\" The collection ends on a strong note with \"The Love of a Good Woman,\" a novella about a circus clown, a tragic comedian in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin. He is frequently in bad straits, but is also enough of a philosopher to ask, \"How can a man have hope in a world where passion and obsession don't have no place?\" Currey's is an eloquent voice.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has many passions in life, writing being one. Unlike a lot of writers, Brandi doesn't see this as a job, but as a passion, and it comes naturally to her. Throughout her life she has played with it, writing quirky poems and short stories bordering on the bizarre, which no doubt reflects her self-proclaimed \"weird\" personality, but only over the last three years has she really focused on finding her voice. Writing is an outlet. It's what offers relief when she is overflowing with creative juices. It is what keeps her company on a quiet night. And, as all writer's can relate, it is what keeps her up far too late when she should be snuggled into her pillow. As of now, Brandi has quite a few projects she is working on, all unique in their own way, but all with an element of fantasy. A perfectionist at heart, she constantly strives to make each work better than the last. Here's to hoping you enjoy her work because there is more to come.", "related": ["B006KJ70X0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My next novel, Twilight Visitor, will be published in 2014. I write awakening-thrillers and inspirational stories. My writing style and the weave of my stories is influenced by my own experiences. I have had plenty of adventurous episodes, brushes with death and roller-coaster rides high and low - and I'm quite sure that the thrill-ride is far from over. I have had a gun aimed to my head while stopping a man from beating a woman and a knife pressed to my back during a hold-up. I was flying two-seater air planes when I was 16 years old. I have chased down a criminal in the middle of Hollywood, fought range-fires in California and pulled unconscious people from a flaming car. I hitch-hiked through much of Canada, to wilderness domains which transcended imagination in their beauty and majesty. The sense of adrenaline, the near death-experiences, the raw unabated thrill of living on the edge - these experiences, the insights I gained and the perspectives I got as I emerged at the other end, permit me to build a realism into my books. The reader is not just reading the creative output of my imagination, but a certain thread of reality too. In addition to my writing career, I worked for over thirty years in America, mostly in executive roles over recruitment, hiring and managing personnel and organizations. I am extensively trained and experienced in organizational structuring and troubleshooting. In those years I also volunteered on natural disasters such as the 2004 tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters ranging from earthquakes to floods. When I am not writing or consulting companies, I can be found speaking somewhere about my books and the subject matter of human trafficking, of which two of my novels embrace thematically.

At 22 he joined the Police Service and spent 15 years patrolling some of the North of England's toughest areas. As his career developed his specialism became Tactical Firearms and he took part in over 200 live firearms scenarios. In 1996 he left the service and moved to the U.A.E. where he worked with several retired members of HM Special Forces.

Repetitive first-person flashbacks recount Violetta's engagement and Dorabella's hasty marriage and widowing; subsequently, Dorabella devotes herself to her child while her twin wonders if her fiance has survived Dunkirk. Then Dorabella's French former lover arrives in England, Violetta is mildly distracted by the steadfast head of the local Home Guard and the sisters turn their mansions into convalescent homes for the wounded with the help of a mysterious, fascinating British captain. The war comes even closer when German spies kidnap Dorabella's son in an attempt to force her to steal radar secrets. The eventful plot compensates somewhat for two-dimensional characters and simple, declarative prose.

Ruthless media tycoon J. Rutherford Pierce has stolen a serum that endows him with super powers and has set out to conquer the Earth. His grand scheme involves eliminating the Cahills, so Dan, Amy, and the others find themselves racing from Ireland to Anatolia to procure ingredients for the serum’s antidote. Meanwhile, the kids are pursued by a squad of superstrong hit men, who turn out to be astonishingly incompetent; the Cahills survive at least six assassination attempts early on in the story—but, then, the tale still has a long way to go, and it wouldn’t do to start killing off cast members yet. Each episode will be packaged with collectible cards, as well as codes that will unlock additional adventures on an associated web page. With a 39 Clues–inspired film tentatively scheduled for release in 2014, this fast read will find a ready-made audience.

There is a little bit of everything in here for everybody: romance, action, intrigue, world politics, techy gadgets, and engaging characters you will love, and some not-so-much. I painstakingly took 9 years to craft this work, paining special attention to make this work of science fiction scientifically plausible when possible, with every detail throughout accurate and correct. I strove especially to make sure the editing was as perfect as it could be, observing punctuation and grammar edits until I thought my eyes would bleed. Throughout the book are themes of patriotism and honor, hoping to show the better parts of who we can be, even in the face of severe struggles.Best regards,Morris E.

My part of the neighborhood was also known as K-Town, named for the streets: Kedvale, Keeler, Kildare, Kolin, Kostner and the others. As a kid I spent a lot of time playing softball in the alley, football in the street, and \"army\" with friends in various back yards. I read a lot, too, just about everything I could get my hands on. Some of my happiest days growing up were spent in the public library. As an adult I've worked as a reporter and editor at various newspapers and magazines in and around Chicago, won awards for my writing and photography, traveled quite a bit, enjoyed good wine and fine cigars. I live on the North Side of Chicago, where I wrote my first novel, The Champagne Ladies, and my second, The Coffin Haulers. From time to time I visit my old neighborhood to have a look around. I miss it.

In the latter I clearly remember writing an essay on Oliver Cromwell – my first piece of military writing. Then came a BA in history and international relations at Nottingham followed by a Master of Philosophy course at the University of York. The subject was the generalship and cavalry of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, my boyhood hero, during the English Civil War. The year I spent researching and writing at York, Oxford and at the British Library in London was a truly wonderful time. However, like all great times it eventually came to an end and I was forced to find employment. Fate took a hand and I landed a job as a research officer with the Defence Intelligence Staff in Whitehall. Writing top-secret intelligence reports was highly exciting, until I realised that their security clearance was so high that only a handful of people were cleared to read them. In 1990, therefore, I decided to apply for a job in the publishing industry as an editor. I joined a small company in said position in the summer of that year and the rest, as they say, is history. The books that I have written to date can be found on my website: www.peterdarman.com", "related": ["B009IY4DMK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

Although he has extensive experience in journalism as an academician and business entrepreneur, Life’s Little Book of Survival Quotes is his first foray into publishing his own works.  After the Twin Towers terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, all but destroyed his means to earn a living (resulting in the loss of his business, his marriage and his home, colleagues, friends and family members), he fought his internal demons and realized there was no other choice but to pull up his boot straps and keep participating in his life.  As new doors started to open, his desire to bring uplifting, inspirational messages and tools to empower people to change their lives increased exponentially. He parlayed his experience in marketing and advertising into strategizing solution-based programs for profit and not-for-profit organizations. And established grassroots platforms to help individuals struggling to rebuild their lives and businesses during these very tough times hit by financial and natural disasters. The entrepreneurial, philanthropic and humanitarian components of Larry’s nature are the basis for his need to nurture and support people to reach their fullest potential. He is a life coach, a mentor, philosopher, and an educator – all of which he learned through practical applications of the education he gained throughout his collegiate years. Underpinning his drive to affect change are four key components: The human spirit, survival, diversity, and the “mojo” (the magic) in his passion for success. His broad-based skills enabled him to create leadership modules used by staff at all levels, retail and promotional campaigns, city and state officials, and media clients. As well as business models for multicultural, spiritual, and educational programs, and the individuals running them. The coaching and mentoring programs Powell developed over the years are an amalgam of his career as a director of creative strategy; marketing/communications consultant; business director; founder and director of his own advertising agencies; and media mogul – all of which have been foundations for his exploration into journalism.  Powell earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in advertising from the University of Texas at Arlington.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Upon promotion to Captain he assumed duties as the Operations Officer and deployed with the unit to Vietnam; arriving on 11 December 1961. As the operations officer he planned, and on 23 December, led thirty helicopters in the first heliborne combat assault of the war. His pioneering work in the development of helicopter tactics during the next year led to his being recognized as the Army Aviator of the Year in 1963. During the next thirteen years, he completed two more trips to the combat zone, and was often involved in other jobs supporting the war effort. This included Army management of the development and initial Vietnam deployment of the new OH-58 helicopter and then service as a Department of the Army staff officer. His thirty year career included commands from platoon, to battalion level and assignments from Korea to Iran. He is a graduate of the Canadian Land Forces Command and Staff College. A Master Aviator, his decorations include, among others, the Legion of Merit, two Distinguished Flying Crosses (one for that first mission), two Bronze Stars, twenty-one Air Medals and the Vietnam Service Medal with three battle stars. Colonel Knight's last assignment was as the Director of the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, a laboratory assigned to the U.S. Army Aviation Research and Development Command. He retired from that position in January 1984 and now lives with his wife Margie in Williamsburg, Virginia.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've been writing ever since I can remember, but it became my full time job in 2010 when I decided that everything else I've tried bores me to death and I have to do what I've always wanted to do, but never had to guts to fully embrace. I've been a journalist, an editor, a personal assistant and an interior designer among other things, but as soon as the novelty of the new, exciting job wears off, I always go back to writing. Being twitchy, impatient, loud and hasty are not qualities that help a writer, because I have to sit alone, preferably still, and write for most of the day, but I absolutely love it. It's the only time that I'm truly at peace and the only thing I can do for more than ten minutes at a time - my son has a bigger attention span than me. When I'm procrastinating, I like to go to the gym, cook Italian meals (and eat them), read, listen to rock music, watch indie movies and True Blood re-runs. Or, in the worst case scenario, get beaten at every Nintendo Wii game by a six-year-old. Don't be shy and get in touch - I love connecting with my readers.

I’m married with three children and I live a very ordinary, some-what boring life in semi-detached suburbia.I have few competitive instincts, which explains why I’ve never had any interest in watching sport. My likes include long country walks and the freedom to think the un-thinkable and my dislikes include sport, anchovies, sport, aubergines and, oh yes, did I mention sport? My philosophy of life is very simple. If you’re not happy with your life, then think about lowering your expectations. If I had to describe myself in two words, it would be skeptical pessimist.
