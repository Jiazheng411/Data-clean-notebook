It sat dead center between her shoulder blades, just out of arm's reach. Like a persistent mosquito buzzing around her ear, it nagged at her. But she couldn't stop to deal with it. Even a small move like that could attract unwanted attention on these South American streets.She needed to remain invisible. To be in and out of Colombia without anyone being able to recognize or remember her. Any connection to her family either by name or face would spell certain death for her and the baby.And Cash. That is, if her brother was still alive. If the Colombian kingpin who had kidnapped Cash's baby girl from her cradle in Eastmeadow, Massachusetts, just four months ago had shown him enough mercy not to kill him. But she couldn't think about that. The Lord had brought her this far on her journey. She had to trust that He would help Cash with his.She held tight to the basket of fruit—it was heavy and her arm ached. She focused her mind on the ache instead of all she couldn't control. Slipping her free hand beneath her poncho, she checked to make sure that her traveling papers were still in her money belt, which was strapped to her waist. They were.Thanks to the duplicate passport the U.S. Embassy had issued for the baby, they'd both be able to fly out of Colombia without incident. Hopefully. The Colombian government might challenge it. But she was ready to deal with that if it happened.Sonny was having a hard time coming to terms with what she was doing. Never in her life had she entertained the idea of doing anything illegal. And here she was in Colombia, ready to steal a baby and flee to the United States.But it was the only way. Even her brother, Dylan, a former marine and a Chicago cop, had assured her of that. Off the record, of course.It had rained in the night and the pungent smell of mud, earth and rotting garbage permeated the quiet, early-morning streets. A thick mist drifted up from the already hot ground. In an hour, the fruit market in the center of the city would be open. Some of the street vendors were already setting up their carts full of goods, ready for the tourists who would soon crowd the road, eager to barter for a bargain.It was a long walk from her little room near the foothills to the center of town. It was also a dangerous walk so early in the morning, alone. But escaping the city would be much easier if she didn't have to contend with the morning traffic.If all went well, Sonny would be long gone by the morning rush. And any evidence of her trip to Colombia would be erased. The team would make sure of that.They had her back—Dylan had promised her.Lord, I hope so.Closing her eyes for a brief moment, she ran through her part of the plan one more time, telling herself she had to get it right. There was no room for error. The sooner she had the baby in her care and was out of Colombia and away from Eduardo Sanchez, the head of the Aztec Corporation, the sooner she'd be able to relax. Really relax. Not like the falling-down-because-you-can't-stay-awake-anymore type of relaxing she'd been doing since she'd first learned her niece had been kidnapped by the Colombian businessman involved in organized crime.The sweat of her palm made it hard to hold the heavy wicker basket in her hand, but she gripped it tighter, ignoring the urge to stretch her arm and scratch her back. As moisture beaded on her brow, Sonny thanked God for the ache in her arm and the itch between her shoulder blades. They kept her mind off her nerves. Off all the things that could go wrong in a long string of choreographed steps that had to be perfectly performed in order for the plan to work.She thought of her brother. Cash would have been as against her coming to Colombia as Dylan had been at first. But then, both of them wanted to believe she was still their baby sister tagging along behind them and not the capable twenty-five-year-old woman she'd grown into. Cash hadn't noticed much of her maturing since he'd become an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Dylan, the eldest, had missed even more while he was away in the military. If it weren't for the fact that she was the only person who could make this plan work, she'd probably be padlocked in her bedroom.But Sonny couldn't think about Cash or Dylan right now. The baby was her only concern. If she failed…No. I'm not leaving this country without little Ellie.She walked off the path and onto the paved road, leading to the center of the city. Unlike the outskirts of town, central Monteria was modern, much like an American city. Stores and restaurants catered to the foreign tourist. Concrete high-rise hotels and office buildings packed the downtown streets. It seemed almost strange that a city like this could be just a few hundred meters from foothills that were lush with greenery and jungle.The basket of fruit she held was just a prop, a reason for her to be walking the streets at this hour of the morning should anyone take notice of her. She'd learned that only vendors walked the road this early in the morning. She couldn't risk renting a car or calling for a taxi—that would leave evidence of where she'd been and where she was going.If she checked her watch, it would confirm what the sky was telling her now as light kissed the horizon and chased away the darkness from the alleyways and side streets. Her pulse pounded as the light grew brighter, the shadows stretching and then fading away. Blood raced through her veins so quickly she was sure her heart was about to burst in her chest.It was almost time.She was ready. As ready as she could be. She'd told Lucia she'd meet her two streets over from the marketplace. The road provided easy access in and out of the city. They'd avoid early marketplace crowds and the eyes of anyone who might be watching.As she rounded the corner and reached the meeting place, she paused just a fraction of a second and listened. The urgent whine of a car engine and tires screeching cut into the calm of the morning. She checked her watch and then looked up to see a bright red blur speeding toward her, the noise of dirty spark plugs sputtering at an ear-splitting volume.So much for being covert.They were earlier than she expected. \"Thank you, Lord,\" she whispered.The dusty compact car ground to a halt next to her.\"Get in!\" the driver demanded as he reached across the seat and threw open the passenger side door. Sonny knew the black-haired man in his early fifties as Torres. She had only met him once. All other contact had been made through his contact at the marketplace and his daughter, Lucia.\"Is it done?\" she asked quickly.\"Leave the basket,\" he ordered in a commanding voice made harsher by his thick accent. \"You must get in, Sonia!\"Sonny jumped into action, unaccustomed to the use of her given name. Stepping off the curb, she caught sight of a figure slumped over in the backseat with a bright red blood stain spreading across a white shirt. She couldn't see the face, but she knew who it was.Heart in her throat, she gasped, \"Oh, dear Lord, no! No! Lucia?\"\"Get in, I tell you! Do you want us all to be killed?\" Sonny dropped the basket, the contents spilling over the potholed street. She hadn't even shut the door before the wheels of the vehicle started spinning again.Sweat poured off Torres's forehead and his hands trembled so violently he couldn't still them on the steering wheel. It didn't take a genius to figure out one of the delicate steps in their plan had gone terribly wrong.Oh, God. Where's Ellie? Please not Ellie. She's just a little baby.Despite the speed of the car flying through the narrow streets, Sonny abandoned the idea of putting on her seat belt and reached into the backseat to touch Lucia. The stench of blood overwhelmed the car.\"Is she…\"Torres kept his eyes on the road. \"Leave her.\"\"But she needs help!\" Sonny protested, tears stinging her eyes. \"We need to help her.\"\"Nothing can be done. She's dead. I'll take care of her body later.\"In horror, Sonny swallowed the bile making its way up her throat. She fought to find her voice. Then swallowed again.Torres's daughter was dead.\"The baby?\" she asked, choking back a sob. \"Ellie?\"\"Asleep under the shawl. Leave her be. She'll be fine and no one will notice us as long as you turn around and act normal.\"\"How is that possible?\" There was so much blood. Sonny fought the urge to check Lucia just to see if Torres was wrong.Oh, please, God, let him be wrong.She forced herself to turn around and slip on her seat belt.The older man glanced at her. \"We need to get out of the city and to the airport right away.\"Sonny stole a quick glance over her shoulder at the bundle next to Lucia's body and closed her eyes to keep the tears at bay. She had the baby now. This was exactly what she'd come here to do. But the image of Lucia's blood-stained body was imprinted in her mind and she wondered if the price of getting the baby had been too high. For Lucia and Torres, it had.When she trusted her voice again, she asked, \"What went wrong?\"\"Nothing,\" Torres said, his voice flat. \"The extraction happened exactly as planned.\"\"I don't understand.\"\"An old debt has been repaid. We make enemies doing what we do. Lucia knew that. This had nothing to do with you or your family.\"Torres reached across the small confines of the car and pushed his rough palm against Sonny's cheek with a force that hurt. \"Hide your face.\"An oncoming police car sped toward them, lights flashing. She quickly turned her gaze to the floor. The car hit a pothole and she gripped the dash with both hands for support.When the police car passed, she glanced back. \"Do you think they were after us?\"\"No.\"\"How can you be sure?\"Torres didn't answer and when Sonny finally looked at him again, it broke her heart to see the man's weary eyes steeped in pain, his weathered face momentarily contorted with grief.He cleared his throat. \"Do you still have them?\"\"What?\"\"The papers! Do you have the papers...", "related": ["B007W5CP9K"], "rank": 1283336, "title": "Her Only Protector", "author": "Lisa Mondello", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It boasted an elegant, federal-style facade and tall windows framed by black shutters. A short flight of steps led to an oak door painted in gleaming vermilion.A bronze plaque beside the door identified the town house as home to the offices of the president's Special Envoy. The position was one of those jobs created to reward rich campaign contributors with a yen for a Washington office and a taste of power politics. Only a handful of insiders knew the Special Envoy also served as Director of OMEGA, a supersecret government agency with an elite cadre of operatives activated only in extreme emergencies.It wasn't an emergency that had brought a small legion of agents in from the various ventures that provided cover in their civilian lives, however. They were gathered in the director's office to welcome back one of their own.Elizabeth Wells had served as executive assistant to OMEGA's director for almost two decades. The silver-haired grandmother had fallen while doing a foxtrot on a big-band cruise of the Potomac with her latest beau. After hip-replacement surgery and months of rehab, Elizabeth was ready to resume her duties.Three of her bosses were present for the homecoming. Adam Ridgeway, code name Thunder, had hired Elizabeth all those years ago. Tall and broad-shouldered, Thunder stood with one hand in the pocket of his hand-tailored slacks and a pained expression on his face while his wife—also a former operative and one-time OMEGA director—related the latest exploits of their youngest.\"Tank insists it wasn't his idea.\" With a rueful grin, Maggie Sinclair, code name Chameleon, continued her description of her son's assault on the hallowed halls of Harvard. \"He also insists he didnotposition Terence atop the bust of John Adams, at the perfect angle to spit into the face of the dean of the Business School.\"Terence, as the assembled operatives all knew, was the orange-and-purple-striped iguana Maggie had brought back from a mission in Central America years ago. The evil-tempered creature was the bane of Adam's existence. He'd been looking forward to its demise for as long as anyone could remember, but his wife and three children adored the damned thing. So much so that Adam Jr.—known to his family and friends as Tank— had carted off the lizard with him to enjoy the delights of his freshman year at Harvard.Tank's sister took up the tale at that point. \"You should have seen Dad's face when the dean called.\"Laughter sparkled in Gillian Ridgeway's vivid blue eyes. She had her father's gleaming black hair and aristocratic features. From her mother, she'd inherited a flair for languages and an irrepressible sense of humor. On extended leave from her job with the State Department, Gillian had filled in as executive assistant to OMEGA's director during Elizabeth Wells's convalescence.\"Dad won't say what it cost to keep both Tank and Terence on the student rolls, but I suspect Harvard got a hefty endowment out of it.\"\"I suspect they'll getseveralendowments before Tank graduates.\"That came from Nick Jensen, code name Lightning, OMEGA's current director. Lightning had headed the agency through three successive presidential administrations. Although he hadn't made a formal announcement, the betting was he'd resign the directorship after the upcoming election. When his wife, Mackenzie, surprised herself and everyone else by turning up pregnant with their first child, the bet had become a sure thing.\"There she is!\"Alerted by a glimpse through the window of a sleek limo gliding to a halt at the curb, Lightning strode out to greet his executive assistant. A few moments later he escorted the slender, gray-haired grandmother into his office.Agents with code names such as Slash, Rogue, Cowboy, Diamond and Cyrene welcomed her with warm hugs. Elizabeth had tears in her eyes when Maggie gave her shoulders a gentle squeeze and Adam dropped an affectionate kiss on her cheek. While the champagne corks popped, Elizabeth dabbed her eyes with a lace-trimmed handkerchief before proceeding to stun the entire gathering.\"I have an announcement. I'm afraid my return is only temporary.\"Instant concern replaced the smiles and good wishes. Lightning's voice went taut. \"What's happened? Did you experience complications you didn't tell me about during my last visit?\"\"As a matter of fact, I did.\" Her pale blue eyes filled with a combination of chagrin and delight. \"I'm getting married next month. Next week, if Daniel has his way.\"After a few seconds of stunned silence, Lightning recovered. \"Daniel? Who the hell is this character, and why didn't you let us check him out?\"\"You did. Very thoroughly, as I recall. It's Daniel Foster.Dr.Daniel Foster.\"\"Your surgeon?\"\"One and the same.\" A hint of red crept into Elizabeth's cheeks. \"Apparently he thinks I have rather elegant hips, before and after the surgery.Ithink he just wants to admire his handiwork.\"Whoops erupted throughout the room. When they subsided and champagne flutes made their way into everyone's hands, Lightning lifted his glass.\"To you and Dr. Dan. He'd better make youveryhappy or some extremely lethal undercover agents will show up on his doorstep.\"Several similar toasts later, Elizabeth brought up the subject of her successor. Her expression was as warm as her voice when she turned to Gillian.\"Lightning says you did a magnificent job covering for me, Jilly. Will you stay on, dear, until you decide whether you want to go back to the State Department?\"\"Well…\"Lowering her lashes, Gillian twirled the stem of her champagne flute between her fingers. She'd planned to wait to make her own announcement. Since Elizabeth had set the stage, however…\"Actually, Iamstaying on. As an agent.\"\"The hell you are!\"The explosive remark surprised everyone, including the operative it burst from. Red surged above the collar of Mike Callahan's shirt collar as all heads turned in his direction, but the frown he directed at Gillian was fierce and unapologetic.She answered the thunderous scowl with one of her quick smiles. \"It's a done deal. Uncle Nick gave his stamp of approval yesterday.\"\"Not without considerable arm twisting,\" her honorary uncle muttered under his breath.Mike Callahan, code name Hawkeye, tightened his jaw. \"You're not trained for this kind of work, Jilly.\"\"I'll get the training.\"Gillian's smile took on an edge that either of her siblings would have recognized in a heartbeat. \"I held my own in Scotland. Didn't I, Rogue?\"The tall, slender blonde she addressed nodded. \"That you did, girlfriend.\"Yeah, Callahan thought savagely. And he hadn't drawn a full breath until he'd put her on a plane for home.A former military cop, he was a dead shot with every weapon in the government's arsenal and a good number that weren't. Hence his code name, Hawkeye, which most of his fellow agents shortened to Hawk. In his civilian life he was a marksmanship instructor at the Federal Law Enforcement Academy at Quantico, Virginia. He'd also taught all three of the Ridgeway offspring to shoot.Gillian-with-a-J had been the first. TheJwas a standing joke that went back to their initial meeting. All arms and long, long legs, the teenager had grinned up at him and introduced herself as Gillian, pronounced with a softG,like in Jillian.Hawk had lost part of his heart to the gangly teen right then and there. In the years since, he'd come damned close to losing the rest of it. Like most of the male agents at OMEGA, he was seriously in lust with the stunning, sensual creature Gillian Ridgeway had become. The woman could set off a firestorm in his belly with a single glance from those electric blue eyes.He'd kept the fire in check, however. Despite the hints she'd been throwing his way recently, he knew damned well he was too old for her, too rough around the edges. He also knew that undercover work could be dangerous not only for him but for anyone who went into the field with him.He looked at her now, his insides twisting as another face superimposed itself on Gillian's classic features. He could hear the splat of bullets tearing through the vines. Feel the vicious downwash of the chopper hovering above the canopy. See the sprawled, lifeless body of the woman he'd gone into the jungle with.Slamming the door on the searing memory, he swung toward Gillian's parents. \"You've both been field agents. You know what it's like. You're good with this?\"\"Yes,\" Maggie said instantly, then flashed an annoyed look when her husband gave a less enthusiastic response.\"I'll admit I'm not particularly thrilled with the idea,\" Adam said coolly, \"but I trust Gillian's instincts.\"Christ! Hawk's gut kinked again. Couldn't they see she lacked the killer instinct? She was too refined, too educated, too damned beautiful to…The sudden buzz of the phone on Lightning's desk sliced into Hawk's chaotic thoughts. The blinking red light that accompanied the buzz stiffened his shoulders.He and everyone else in the room knew that blinking light was the direct line to the White House… and that they should clear out of the director's office, fast. Depositing their champagne glasses, they made for the door.Maggie and Adam could have stayed. They'd both taken direct calls from past presidents and were still cleared at the highest levels.

Her job. Her research. Her attempt to make a difference.Two years working on a new laboratory test to detect blood-borne pathogens, and the board still couldn't decide if she deserved additional funding.Pulling in a calming breath, she slipped her hands into the powdered latex gloves and snipped off a segment of tubing from three units of blood.Collected at a South Georgia blood draw earlier in the week, the units had been transported to Magnolia Medical's laboratory in Atlanta for processing. Ensuring the blood was safe for transfusion was top priority.The units had passed the routine battery of tests.They'd flunked Allison's.She spun the segments in the centrifuge, then transferred the top layer of golden serum into the analyzer.The test was a semiautomated procedure. Rapid, if not reliable. Given time, she'd work out the kinks.The instrumentation clicked into operation.If she believed in the power of prayer, this would be the time to ask for help. But God had turned His back on her years ago. No reason anything would change today.Discarding her gloves, she wiped her damp palms against the side of her lab coat. Behind her, footsteps sounded across the polished tile floor. She turned as Veronica Edwards, the research department's laboratory manager, entered the special projects area.\"I thought you'd be tied up all afternoon with the directors.\" Allison noted her supervisor's drawn face and furrowed brow. Evidently, the meeting hadn't gone well.\"The board cut your funding.\"Allison's chest tightened. \"Did you tell them I'm optimistic about perfecting the procedure?\"\"They're focused on cost reduction, not sinking more money into a laboratory test that, with time,maydetect a rare prion disease.\"\"A rare but fatal prion disease,\" Allison corrected her.\"Which has never posed a significant problem in the U.S.\"The muscles in Allison's neck tensed. \"Great Britain didn't think it had a problem until the prion outbreak there. Remember the havoc mad cow disease caused? We're still restricting donations from people who lived in Europe during that time for feartheywill infectourblood supply.\"Veronica sighed. \"I understand the significance of your research. If we can find a way to identify the dormant prion protein, we can lift the European restriction.\"\"And end the blood-shortage crisis. Magnolia Medical would control the patent on a test sure to be adopted in every blood-donor center throughout the country. The revenue alone would—\"\"But two years with no hint of success, Allison. It's over.\"The analyzer stopped. Thirty seconds and the results would feed to the monitor.Time to come clean. Her supervisor needed to be brought up to date.\"I ran random specimens yesterday from that last blood draw, expecting the units to be negative. Three reacted so I tested them again this morning with the same results.\" Allison tried to smile but knew she fell short. \"They say the third time's a charm. I repeated the procedure just now.\"Allison glanced at the monitor as the results rolled across the screen. \"The levels are identical to the first two runs.\"\"Meaning?\"\"Meaning three donors will soon develop neurological symptoms that will eventually lead to death.\"Veronica stepped closer. \"The likelihood of picking up a single positive specimen—let alone three—in one blood draw is—\" her eyes widened \"—unheard of.\"\"We never had a rapid, cost-effective test to screen donor blood before.\"Veronica held up her index finger. \"A test that's still in the experimental phase.\"Do or die. Allison was gambling everything on the next bit of information she needed to share.\"The three positive specimens came from donors who live in the same small town—Sterling, Georgia.\"The lab manager's eyebrow shot up. \"You accessed their personal donor data?\"Allison nodded. \"According to the information I found online, the area is a haven for deer hunters. Maybe the men ate venison from deer with chronic wasting disease. I'll drive to Sterling after work tonight. If I talk to the men, I may find a common link.\"Veronica shook her head. \"I don't like it.\"\"Three days and I should have an answer.\"Veronica caved. \"Two days. But watch what you say. I wouldn't want anyone to be told they have a fatal disease because of a questionable result from a test that's far from ready for clinical use. And no contact with the media. We don't want any wild stories about an outbreak of mad cow disease in Georgia. Invalid test results would blacken Magnolia Medical's good name.\"\"But the testisvalid,\" Allison said with conviction.\"Then find the connection with infected deer.\"Veronica headed for the door, but Allison's next comment caused her to pause. \"Venison may not be the source of infection.\"Veronica held up her hand. \"If you're thinking contaminated beef is the problem, you're jumping to a conclusion I'm not willing to consider. Find the reason for the positive reactions. See whether they tie in with a diseased deer population.\"\"And if not?\" Allison asked.Neither of them gave voice to the obvious. If the test were valid and if eating or handling contaminated venison had not infected the men, then an even more serious situation was raising its ugly head in South Georgia. A situation that could impact the entire southeast, if not the nation.\"Then God help us,\" Veronica said as she turned on her heel and left the lab.After all that had happened, Luke Garrison was riding on empty. His sister's handicap, the trauma that had pushed her farther into a world of isolation, their father's tragic death. Ten years ago, yet the memories were too real, too fresh. Any hope for the future seemed as elusive as the moonbeams filtering through the cloudy night sky.Luke pulled his eyes from the long stretch of highway that led back to Sterling and glanced at his sister, Shelly, sleeping in the backseat of his SUV.\"Poor thing, she's worn out,\" his aunt said from the passenger seat.\"So are you.\" Luke noted the fatigue that lined the older woman's face. Even her vibrant red hair seemed limp and lifeless in the half-light coming from the dash. \"Shelly's trips to the doctor in Atlanta take their toll on you, Bett.\"\"You worry as much as I do about her. If only the doctor would offer some encouragement.\"\"We'll keep praying for a miracle,\" he said, hearing more optimism in his voice than he felt.A decade of pain remained heavy on his heart.Letting out a frustrated breath, he forced his gaze back to the road, determined to send the memories scurrying into the night.The lights from town glowed in the distance.Bett's eyes began to droop and her head rested on the seat back as she drifted into a light slumber.At the fork in the road, Luke veered left onto the desolate two-lane that skirted Sterling—the route he had routinely chosen since his father's death. No need to give the townspeople more fuel for their insistent chatter. As far as he was concerned, the less time he spent in town the better.Up ahead, the old Wallace Bed and Breakfast stood out against the cloudy sky, the only structure on this stretch of lonely back road.What a shame to let such a beautiful place go so long without upkeep. If repairs weren't done soon, even the few travelers who meandered through Sterling would find lodging elsewhere.Thank you, Cooper Wallace. So much for greedy lawyers who always thought of the bottom line.Luke glanced again at the once-stately Victorian. A light flickered in the upstairs hall window. The glass shimmered in the night.Shimmered like—Realization hit him full force.Fire!He swerved to the side of the road and slammed on the brakes.Bett's eyes flew open.\"The B and B's on fire. Call for help!\"Before she could find her cell, Luke was out of the car and running toward the shingled structure.He tried the front door. Locked.\"Fire! Open up! Everyone out,\" he screamed, pounding the brass knocker against the thick oak.Please, God, if anyone's staying the night, let them hear me.The kitchen entrance might be open.He raced to the back of the house, tried the doorknob and was ready to crash through the door when he raised his eyes.A woman stood at the second-story window, frantically pounding her hands against the glass.Heart in his throat, Luke slammed his full weight against the kitchen door, relieved when the aged oak gave way. Inside, the smoke rolled through the house, thick and black.\"Fire,\" he screamed again.A middle-aged man coughed as he staggered from the darkness.\"How many people are staying here?\" Luke asked.\"A guy and his wife are in the back bedroom. They're headed this way. But someone's trapped upstairs. The fire's raging at the top of the staircase. There's no way to reach her.\"\"Where's the night manager?\"\"He left hours ago.\"Before the man finished speaking, a young couple stumbled into the kitchen. The woman gasped for air.\"Get outside,\" Luke ordered. He reached for the woman's arm and guided the three of them to safety.As they scurried away from the house, Luke looked up once again. An increased sense of dread slipped over him. Unable to break the window, the woman stood outlined against the deadly glow from the fire that filled the room.Climbing onto the porch railing, Luke shimmied up the column holding the drainage spout to the overhanging roof, then hoisted himself onto the ledge that rimmed the second story.Adrenaline coursed like lightning through his veins as he scooted toward the window, aware of the growing crackle of the flames coming from within the aged structure. A section of the narrow railing broke. His foot gave way. He grabbed the rough shingles, holding on with his fingertips, and hugged the wall to maintain his balance.His rapidly beating heart seemed as loud as the sirens wailing through the night. Fire trucks would arrive soon, but not in time to save the woman.He inched forward. Sweat trickled down his back and dampened his shirt.Reaching th...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Underhill, who selected these pieces from more than 500 submissions, looked for moving expressions of a woman's joys, fears and pain. The stories cover such milestones as a chance reunion with a high school classmate, marriage, pregnancy, motherhood and coming to terms with aging. Many stories have an upbeat tone, such as Linda Dietrick's description of how she finally found a good relationship in \"Falling in LoveAAgain.\" Others write about overcoming adversity, as in Paula E. Buford's account of her battle against gender prejudice at an all-male conference in \"Fighting Discrimination with Dignity.\" A few contributions also present a darker view. Lisa M. Cheater's \"The Visit\" provides a harrowing account of a dysfunctional family, and Kimberly Luxenberg's \"Dark Side of Genius\" addresses the destructive power of drugs and alcohol. Although the writing iss often mediocre, the aim of most pieces is true. Agent: Jillian Manus.

In the article, \"In Centenary Honor of Mark H. Liddell: The Shakespearean Tragedy,\" McWhorter demonstrates how difficult Shakespeare is for modern theatergoers and calls for careful and thoughtful translations of the plays.From the start, I wanted my translations to be literature and sound like Shakespeare. Getting that sound requires that I use the same style of blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter) that Shakespeare used and that I use it accurately. I also wanted the language in my translations to be challenging. Shakespeare used difficult language, both in the size of his vocabulary and the complexity of his sentences. As I translate, I maintain the same sentence length and complexity as in Shakespeare's original, careful not to simplify or \"dumb him down.\" I want readers to forget that they are reading a translation.To produce accurate translations, I trust none of my intuitions. With each line, I consult historical dictionaries and draw heavily on scholarship found in the many edited and glossed editions of the plays. I assume that without the help of scholars, I will fall for every false friend (words whose meanings have changed) and miss subtlety. Of course, I must sometimes guess at the meaning, but I prefer the guess be made by the many scholars who have closely studied Shakespeare since the 18th century. My job is to figure out  what each line means and then make it more comprehensible in language that seems Shakespearean.I hope you get a chance to read one of my translations. The patina that builds up on an antique over time can no doubt add its own beauty, but it can also hide it. You might be surprised just how good Shakespeare is when a bit of the grime and discoloration left by language change has been removed.", "related": [], "rank": 1644256, "title": "Much Ado About Nothing: A Verse Translation", "author": "William Shakespeare", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this case, Faerie is the land of Barakhai, where thanks to \"the Curse\" everyone spends half of each day as a human and the other half as some kind of animal. Biology student Benton Collins allied himself with the renegades seeking to lift the curse in the previous volume. Now the dissidents want him again, since he's the one person who can safely seek the Lost Dragons, the last surviving descendants of the mighty Prinivere and the key to doing anything about the curse. To do this, he needs to deal again with his old lover, Carrie Quinton (understandably out for his blood in revenge for her disfigurement); not lose his temper with Zylas, the leader of the renegades (especially when Zylas is in a white rat's form); and try not to fall in love with Falima (a loyal companion and a fine-looking woman when she isn't a mare). Despite the brisk action, scenes are left undeveloped, the conflicts lack intensity and emotional impact and the characterization borders on the bland. The earlier novel did a good deal (some of it quite witty) with the animal-human changes, but this effort doesn't really do justice to what is potentially the strongest element in the saga. More than a few readers, especially those who appreciate the author's fine folkloric and mythic fantasy, are likely to feel disappointed.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Axtaga returns to Obaba, the fictional village at the heart of his acclaimed novelObabakoak, to tell a gorgeous and ambitious story about the Basque land and language. Much of the book is set in the 1960s, when David Imaz, the teenage son of an accordionist, begins to suspect his father participated in the execution of villagers accused of being Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Twenty-five years after the war officially ended, political—even inadvertently political—choices remain deadly, but fear of Franco's civil guard neither darkens the innocence or exuberance of the young nor lightens the guilt of their parents. In Obaba, grudges and friendships are long-lasting and deep, and secrets are buried only shallowly. The narrative moves back and forth through time, from the 1990s, when gravely ill David reflects on his life from a ranch in California, to the war in the 1930s and through David's sometimes dangerous coming-of-age up through the 1970s. Originally written in Basque (and later translated into Spanish), the novel is a worthy addition to both Axtaga's body of work and the Basque canon.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although there is a mountain of research on the impact of feedback on student learning, teacher feedback is impotent unless it is accurate, timely, and designed to improve performance. With compelling evidence and practical exercises, this book builds a necessary bridge from theory to practice. Readers will learn that schools are confronted with a stark choice between two alternatives. The common choice is the continued pursuit of manufactured formative assessments that fail to inform instruction and grading policies that deliver distorted evaluations of student performance. The more challenging choice a choice that must be learned rather than purchased is proposed in these pages. The second choice requires reflection, practice, and deep understanding. If teachers and school leaders respond to Marzano s challenge, then the benefits for student learning, teaching excellence, and professional satisfaction will be deep and lasting. --Douglas B. Reeves, chairman, The Leadership and Learning Center, Salem, MassachusettsOnce again, Bob Marzano has brought world-class clarity and analysis to two profoundly important factors that affect student learning: formative assessment and grading. His findings and the practical actions he recommends are vital if we truly intend to educate ever-larger proportions of students. --Mike Schmoker, author and consultant, Flagstaff, ArizonaIn my work with educators and leaders across North America, the books of Robert Marzano are continually cited as being guiding models that schools are following to improve instructional practices and student learning. Formative Assessment and Standards-Based Grading is likely to join the ranks as one of those comprehensive masterworks that educators return to again and again for meticulously researched, high-impact assessment and grading practices that are fully explained and richly illustrated with relevant examples across multiple grades and content areas. There are so many important sentences, explanations, examples, quotes, supporting research, and practical exercises in this book that readers are likely to use up an entire box of highlighters trying to capture them all! Every educator and leader, new and experienced, who wants to expand his or her own assessment and grading literacy needs to move this book to the top of the must read stack. --Larry Ainsworth, executive director of professional development, The Leadership and Learning Center, Englewood, ColoradoOnce again, Bob Marzano has brought world-class clarity and analysis to two profoundly important factors that affect student learning: formative assessment and grading.

Intentionally and unintentionally peers, teachers and strangers reinforced his status as an outcast due to his effeminate behavior. His parents, wishing to raise their child right, openly disapproved of these undesirable tendencies and believed they could be erased. Unwittingly, they projected overt and subliminal messages which further confirmed his feelings of inadequacy. The pain was worse as a child. Because of poor grades and atypical sexual identity, he was sent to military prep school. Anguish didn't diminish in adolescence, but as he grew, self-knowledge also began to appear, albeit in fits and starts. At seventeen, determined to be happy, he left military school and fled to New York City where he played out fantasies and searched for identity. When he got sick and was rescued by his parents, he completed high school, prospered at a small, progressive college and graduated. After teaching French in a small Quaker school in rural British Columbia he moved to Jamestown, NY, where he taught French for two more years. There, he discovered that by pretending to be straight, others would get hurt, too. It was becoming clear that he'd only find identity and legitimacy in New York City, where he'd have freedom to pursue his dreams, not other people's. He began a forty year career in an agency for people with disabilities as he continued his search. At NYU, he studied special education, psychology and more French and left to study ASL (American Sign Language) under Martin Sternberg, author of the American Sign Language Dictionary. After making many good and poor decisions, at thirty five he met the one who would become his life's companion. Together, they built a nest, raised two boys, then retired. The American dream fulfilled. Why did it have to take so long?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Natural similarities and potentially enlightening differences appear (such as Muhammad's becoming the sovereign of his own Islamic nation while Jesus, who never held a governance position as Muhammad did, was a \"man-God, a human voice with the gravity of the Divine\"), but not much more is done with them. Peters seems particularly and inexplicably dismissive of certain commonly held beliefs among Muslims and Muhammad biographers, among them Muhammad's age (Muslim tradition says he was 40); the circumstances of his marriage to his first wife, Khadija (most sources say it resulted from Khadija's own proposal); and Peters's stubborn habit of describing the Qur'an as poetry and Muhammad as a poet, although such a view is anathema in Islam or Islamic studies.

What excites you most about your book's topic? Why did you choose it?A. I have always been fascinated with the paranormal and the idea\nthat a part of the human personality survives physical death.  I am a\nparanormal researcher in my spare time and as the founder of Synergy\nParanormal Investigations, Harvard, NE. I spend nearly every weekend out\n searching haunted locations for evidence of the paranormal. I love\nghost stories!  We all tend to write about what we know and have passion\n for. I can't imagine writing about anything else. I also enjoy sharing\nmy faith so my books give me an opportunity to do that as well.Q. How long did the book take you from start to finish?A. I have spent another eight months working on this book in addition\n to the original three months it took to put it together in the first\nplace.  Altogether, it took nearly one year to complete.Q. What aspect of writing the book did you find particularly challenging?A. The hardest part of writing is the editing.  When you go back\nthrough the manuscript and decide what to leave in and what to take\nout.  Every paragraph should move the story along when you are trying to\n build dramatic tension.  Once in awhile you find a great piece of prose\n that you really like but it isn't really necessary to the story line.\nThus, the dilemma; do you keep it or throw it out?  Generally, it has to\n go!  Sometimes I will write it down and save it for another day.Q. What surprised you the most about the book writing process?A.  I was most surprised by the excitement of the creative process.\nWhen the creative juices are flowing and everything is falling into\nplace it is an exhilarating experience.  It can have its ups and downs\nbut the highs are amazing.Q. What do you hope your readers will gain from reading your books?A. I hope they will think about the power of faith in their lives.\nPrayer and trust in God can help us straighten out the unexpected curves\n life throws at us.  We may not ever run into horrific demonic entities\nin the flesh but we all have our metaphoric demons to contend with.\nFaith can help us tackle those as well.  I must admit though; I love a\ngood scare.  I hope my book makes the reader have a few chills up and\ndown their spines along the way too.Q. What projects are you currently working on?A. I am working on the third installment of the Mojo Series.  I\noriginally planned to write a trilogy; publishing one book per year.\nHowever, the third book will not be completed by next summer.  I am\nchanging it up quite a bit from its original outline. The muse is\ndefinitely not satisfied thus far!  I am also working on a Non-Fiction\nparanormal research book that will be based on Synergy's case files.\nI'm incredibly excited about the prospect of sharing my experiences and\nregaling real-world ghost hunting adventures.Q. Is writing your sole career? If not, what else do you do?A. No. I work full time as a Nursing Home Administrator and RN\nConsultant.  I am also the founder of Synergy Paranormal Investigations,\n Harvard,NE.   I have always wanted to be a part of the paranormal\nresearch community.  In January of 2011 I made the decision to form the\ngroup and jump in with both feet.  It has been an amazing ride!  I have\nalso had the opportunity to become a producer for Nebraska's longest\nrunning Paranormal radio program, Exploring Unexplained Phenomena, with\nhost, Scott Colborn, at KZUM in Lincoln, NE.  Scott has amazing guests\non the program and it has been so educational for me.  Exposure to some\nof the experts in the field has given me additional information and\ninsight into the realm of paranormal exploration.Q. Did you do any research for your books, or did you write from experience?A.  I did do some research about demons, and ghost hunting but mostly\n I wrote from experience.  The next installment of the series should\nhave the latest tools in paranormal investigation such as the \"ghost\nbox\" and lasers to help the characters in their work.", "related": [], "rank": 3511749, "title": "Mojo", "author": "Kris Sedersten", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Somehow, the discovery of a new map sets my imagination to wandering over the landforms, and tracing curious pathways along unknown roads and rivers. A good visit with a map has always been a way to go some place I have never been, and I have often gone to great pains to find more and more detailed maps once there, to fill in blank spaces in my view of the world, and tell me tales of far away places.This story grew from one of my typical evening sessions with an atlas! While squinting at the heart of Central Asia one day, I was suddenly struck by the vast, empty quarter of the Tarim Basin, which is now in NW China and is sometimes vaguely labeled \"Autonomous Regions.\" The basin forms a deep thumbprint on the \"Roof of the World\" and is bordered by the Tien-Shan Mountains to the north, Pamirs to the west, and the Kunlun and Altun Shan ranges to the south. At the heart of the basin is one of the most desolate and rigorous desert environments of the world--The Taklamakan. I could recall being curiously drawn to it, staring at my maps and wondering what was actually there, and what it would be like to stand among high drifts of sand dunes in a place that has been feared and avoided throughout all of human history.A kind of synchronicity soon developed in my life, and I found that my interest was tuning me in to information about the region from many unexpected quarters. I encountered TV documentaries chronicling the find of ancient mummies in the desert. I found myself using the wonder of the Internet to download high-resolution satellite photos of the area, and put a picture in my minds eye, sketching out the empty hole that the great Taklamakan represented on most of my maps. And the closer I looked at my maps, the more I came to find that there were human footprints all through this desolate and empty region! Small settlements still existed on the fringes of the desert, and I learned that in centuries past they had been major trading centers along the famous \"Silk Road.\"Way leads on to way, as the poet says, and I soon began to look for information about the people and cultures that flourished on the edge of this great empty desert, and became interested in their daily lives and struggles. It was not long before I realized that I could not have been the first person to have such an interest. My research soon led me to a man who had spent the latter part of his life exploring the region, and unearthing many of the remarkable relics and ruins of ancient civilizations that have long been buried beneath the shifting sands of the Taklamakan. His name was Dr. Aurel Stein, a Hungarian born archeologist who worked in the service of the British Empire nearly a hundred years ago. His explorations have been detailed in works such as \"The Ruins of Desert Cathay,\" and \"The Sand Buried Ruins of Khotan.\" I made great pains to find these old, (and now out of print), books, some complete sets now selling for as much as $25,000 for original first run printings of the five volume set where Stein recounted his three expeditions from 1900 to 1913.Sadly, he did not survive his fourth attempt, but his work led to tremendous discoveries of ancient stupas, shrines, scrolls, pottery, sculptings and other artifacts of the people who lived, traded and died along the Silk Road. I found myself transfixed with interest as I read his work, and oh...the maps! His third expedition yielded the most lovingly detailed maps I have ever found of the region, and I have spent many hours with them, wandering along the ancient tracks of the desert in my mind.Then, in June of the year 2000, the faces of people and images of places I had studied just seemed to leap into focus for me, and a story emerged from my unconscious that simply had to be given tangible form. I can remember waking from dreams, where I saw the characters in my mind's eye, heard them speaking, and bore witness to their struggles. So I shut the world away one afternoon, put my fingertip on an empty spot on the map, and started writing. I entered that timeless quarter that all writers know, where the hours just seemed to fly by. Over the next few months I bent myself to the project with tireless energy. As the story unfolded, it demanded more and more research into the languages, cultural traditions, currency, religion, trade practices, clothing, warfare and even the camels that brought the Silk Road to life. This information began to infuse itself into my writing, until I realized I was deep into the process of creating a serious historical novel, enjoying the work immensely.While the people in this story are my own fictional creations, the places are very real. My maps now told me the finest of details...where the sand dunes drifted, where the rivers flowed gathering into salt marshes fringed by twisted remnants of tamarisk and withered poplars--where each and every hamlet and village scratched out a living on the edge, and at times in the very heart, of the desert. They were all returning to life now in my story, where segments of the dialogue were actually based, at times, on fragments of translated scrolls and old Tibetan woods unearthed during Stein's expeditions.This is the story that emerged from that empty space on my maps. In a way, it also became a story about a map, and the curiosity of a simple trader that leads him on a quest that will change his life forever... \"Taklamakan--The Land of No Return.\" The original novel was written in two books and bound as one volume under the title Taklamakan. I have since revised and extended the story by another 30,000 words, adding seven more chapters, and released these digital volumes as they were first conceived, as two books.  The second volume is entitled Khan Tengri - The Lord of the Sky, and together the two books extend well beyond 300,000 words, my opus Magnum, an epic tale of the Silk Road.If you have ever wanted to leave behind our \"Brave New World\" and vanish into the heart of some distant, unexplored land, then meet Tando Ghazi Khan, and join, for a time, his caravan on the edge of the Taklamakan desert. And, to use an expression oft spoken by one traveler on that road to another, \"Yol Bolsun!\" - May there be a way, and may you find a safe road! - John Schettler", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Roger will not wait any longer and he begins the meal.  A little later, his intended arrives soaking wet, and as she enters the castle she is a bit put off because no one is there to greet her party.  Mina Chilcott musters up all her integrity and marches into the hall where everyone is eating and she takes her place at the table, much to Roger's surprise.  Her dripping wet gown is sticking to her well formed body and Roger notices it immediately.  Roger and Mina are very much alike;  spirited, independent and strong and so they butt heads from the very beginning.  Roger learns from Mina's brother that their father starved and whipped her, and he is outraged that any man would treat a woman in such a harsh and cruel way. They are married  but she overhears Rogers boasting of his prowess with women.  This infuriates Mina and she wants to destroy his manly pride. Mina plans for their wedding night and when Roger enters their bedchamber he kisses her and she experiences new feelings at his touch, but she will prove that she is more clever than he.  She drugs Roger and in the morning she allows him to believe that they consummated the marriage, and that he was rough, and hurt her.  This greatly upsets Roger since he can't remember what had happened, and he was taught never to hurt women.  They argue and Roger leaves in a huff, warning her that he is the master and she best not forget it, or she will rue the day!  Roger leaves for awhile, but when he returns, he brings a gift for Mina. Mina and Roger have thought things through, and they want to start all over again, so they start by going to bed.  Roger is confused, and Mina confesses her deceit, but this pulls them farther apart than before. Mina turns to Roger's friend Albert for advice but Roger misunderstands the situation; Mina is convinced that Roger is unfaithful and it seems to be a hopelessly tangled mess!  Roger comes to realize that he loves Mina while at the same time she realizes that she loves him! But Roger can stand it no more and he tells Mina that she and Albert can leave. Totally affronted by his insinuation, Mina checks her temper and tells Roger the truth, and then she reveals her own insecurities about his philandering ways.  Mina wants love and respect, and by showing her vulnerability, she wins her Norman's Heart.Ms. Moore has penned a very romantic historical!

A professor of religious studies at Ohio State, Urban is interested in secrecy in religion, and in this book he chronicles the way Hubbard reacted to legal and political challenges to his authority by attempting (largely successfully) to conceal his theories from the public.\"--Rachel Aviv,London Review of Books\"[A] slim, thoughtful investigation of Scientology as a uniquely American religious phenomenon, one whose history has a great deal to teach us. . . . He is more interested in how the church has reflected and influenced currents in American history. . . . Most fascinating is Urban's argument that Scientology has been instrumental in shaping how the US government defines religion.\"--Mark Oppenheimer,The Nation\"The most scholarly treatment of the organization to date.\"--Michael Shermer,Scientific American\"The Church of Scientologyis a fascinating book. . . . [A] deep and often brilliant anthropological dissection. . . . Where more populist authors might find it difficult, for instance, to take seriously a religion that makes its most devoted followers sign a 'billion-year contract', Urban is po-faced throughout. As a result, he is granted exceptional access to Scientologists and their detractors, and builds from the often barmy material a compelling picture of the birth of a new religion. For this is the book's central thesis: that by analysing how new religions emerge and flourish, we may better understand those whose origins are lost in the haze of time. . . . Urban's portrayal of the birth and boom of Scientology is absorbing and impressive.\"--Alex Preston,The Guardian\"Judiciously balanced, with a myriad of footnotes . . . mercifully free of the jargon to be found within both Scientology and all too many academic volumes.\"--Eileen Barker,Times Higher Education\"Urban's book is valuable for how well he organizes a massive amount of information in a well-paced, enjoyable read. . . . [A] fascinating book.\"--Tony Ortega,Village Voice\"A fascinating and oftentimes mind-bending account of how penny-a-word sci-fi writer L. Ron Hubbard doggedly pursued the 'religion angle' in his quest to create the worldwide Church of Scientology. Urban makes it clear from the outset that he could have written a lot more about Scientology than he has here--perhaps even a few volumes more. Settling on a narrower scope, however, hasn't precluded the author from presenting a thoroughly absorbing chronicle of Scientology's 60-year history in America. . . . An intriguing introduction into the labyrinthine world of Scientology and its meaning in American society.\"--Kirkus Reviews\"Urban describes concisely the development of the Church of Scientology from a pseudopsychological self-help business venture to a self-proclaimed 'religion' fighting vigorously for government recognition. . . . Highly recommended, this is a valuable, evenhanded, academic but engaging introduction to the controversial church, both for those interested in the topic of religious studies and for general readers.\"--Library Journal\"A fascinating account of how a healing practice called Dianetics came to define itself--and become officially recognized--as a religion in the United States. Urban strains to strike a balance between what he calls 'a hermeneutics of respect and a hermeneutics of suspicion,' grounded in a firm belief in freedom of worship and an obligation to ask tough questions about alleged misbehavior by Scientologists.\"--Glen Altschuler,Boston Globe\"Essential. . . . Urban [has] brought the study of Scientology to a crucial, long-delayed point--[his] work will allow for more critical reflection on an important part of 20th-century American religion. With this history available as a resource, scholarship on Scientology will be able to move away from obsession with the checkered history of a single institution and encompass the variety of ways in which individual Scientologists have lived their faith both within that institution and outside of it.\"--Seth Perry,Chronicle Review\"[A] refreshingly even-handed treatment.\"--Joe Humphreys,Irish Times\"Provide[s] valuable and balanced accounts of Scientology. [E]minently readable.\"--Newark Star Ledger\"Urban addresses his subject as a historian of religion and objectively traces the complex history of a movement that is now recognized as a religion in the U.S. . . . With his fair, scholarly approach, Urban has written what is probably the best history available of this terribly tangled story.\"--Choice\"Although Scientology is perhaps the 'case study' in Urban's book, the questions he raises and his broader analysis apply to all religions and offer insight into the complex and tangled issue of guaranteeing freedom of religion within a society such as the United States. . . . It is clear that Urban is a strong supporter of religious freedom and a great enthusiast of the world's diverse religions. In the midst of many conversations about religion today that sometimes are superficial or narrow-minded, Urban's scholarly respect for religion and the book's delicately balanced examination of Scientology are refreshing.\"--Leigh E. Rich,Bioethical Inquiry\"This is a book not only for studying Scientology, but also for wrestling with questions about the definition of religion, First Amendment and church/state issues, and religious freedom post 9/11.\"--Armand J. Boehme,Reviews in Religion & Theology\"This book offers fresh perspectives on Scientology and Urban's balanced approach makes it a must-read for scholars of new religious movements and also motivated general readers.\"--Marion Goldman,International Journal for the Study of New Religions\"[Readers] will be most interested in Urban's thoughts on who gets to decide what qualifies as religion. . . . [A] readable book that provides a model of how to discuss a religious group while addressing theoretical questions of substance.\"--Mark D. Chapman,Review of Religious Research\"I highly recommend the book to not only scholars of new religious movements and American religions, but to all scholars of religion. . . . This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Scientology or the construction of the category of religion in public life.\"--Kelly J.

His sudden death--he is found in a pool of blood, clean shaven, with a prayer shawl stuffed down his throat--poses two mysteries: Who killed him, and what took them so long? For Doug Orlando, a gay homicide squad veteran, the task is not just to bring Rabowitz's killer to justice but to solve the case before the city's ethnic fabric is torn to shreds. Lack of cooperation from various ethnic factions in the neighborhood obstructs the investigation. Compounding Orlando's difficulties is his former partner, Briggs, who is eager to discredit him for cooperating with an investigation into his killing of an unarmed black teenager. Newcomer Johnson has crafted a literate murder mystery that expands the genre to include deft commentary on the changing face of urban centers. Additionally, the domestic scenes between Orlando and his lover of 12 years, Stewart, provide a sensitive and often humorous contrast to the dangers and frustrations of police work.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This convinced him that you do not have to be a medical professional to make a contribution. He has now come up with a radical new theory to treat HAIR LOSS and male pattern baldness( MPB) called the MALINIAK METHOD which uses NO DRUGS, NO LOTIONS and NO SURGERY. It says science has failed to solve this problem because it focused only on  dihydrotestosterone(DHT) and ignored a SECOND factor, which is the PRIOR effect of a layer of the scalp called the GALEA. It starts the hair loss syndrome in ONLY those men where it becomes very \"tight\" and chokes off the blood supply. These men go bald on the TOP of the scalp and only where this GALEA exists and nowhere else because it causes DHT to accumulate there and this makes it detrimental to hair growth instead of being beneficial.", "related": [], "rank": 4299437, "title": "The Maliniak Method - Stop Hair Loss and Grow New Hair eBook", "author": "Leon  Maliniak", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then just the next year, they record a huge victory, 10,000 Celts dead,\nand only 360 Roman casualties.Then the next spring, they retreat southwards, concede all the hard-fought ground\nthey'd won, leave a defensible position (the earthen wall they built between\nrivers Forth and Clyde), and retreat to an indefensible one; the wall they had\nto build, later in Emperor Hadrian's reign.I know the facts don't make sense.So I began the story; Caledonii: Birth of a Celtic Nation.The story begins years before the Roman invasion, and traces the unification\nof the clans.

Relying on a sustained comparison with the British case, Go argues that the U.S. experience with imperial rule during its rise, height, and current decline has not been fundamentally different from that of other imperial states. As in all such cases, the specific circumstances of U.S. empire have emerged from the interactions between imperial rulers and colonial subjects. As Go puts it, \"rather than omnipotent powers that easily make and remake their subjects and spaces, and rather than entities shaped from within, [empires] must be understood as adaptive dynamic entities that are shaped and reshaped by foreign societies as much as they strive to control them\" (27). This masterfully written book represents several of the best traditions of politics & history research. In the historical sociology tradition of Theda Skocpol, it deploys the comparative method to illuminate large substantive questions of power and governance. It traces big, slow-moving processes over 300-plus years of history across multiple continents, and yet supports its key claims with careful archival research. And its central argument questions the received wisdom about the past in ways that are of broad contemporary significance. In particular, Go's observation that \"falling empires, like rising ones, do not behave well\" provides a cautionary lesson for the U.S. role in the world today.\" -David Keck, J.

After reading this book, one is inclined to say, 'Yes, but not yet.'\"--Economist\"[A] major contribution to understanding the real world of Islam in France. . . . An insightful and informative study.\"--Choice\"The book is richly documented, explicitly supportive of the Muslim point of view and deeply sympathetic to them.\"--Vaidehi Nathan,Organiser\"Bowen's study of Islam [in] a lesser-known social context is very welcome.\"--Jack David Eller,American Anthropology Review\"The great merit of this book is not only that it empirically answers the question it asks, but in doing so, it opens up a series of questions pertaining to the place of Islam in France and the complex and different relations between citizenship and French religions in a postcolonial society.\"--Abdelmajid Hannoum,Contemporary Sociology\"[Bowen] makes an important contribution to both the anthropology of France and the anthropology of Islam in the West through his detailed discussion of different Islamic schools of religious interpretation and traditions of jurisprudence. By examining the myriad debates that define a global Islamic space, Bowen challenges stereotypes about the monolithic religion that prevail in the media and across the political spectrum. . . . Bowen does a remarkable job of sifting through and making sense of a vast array of approaches to Islamic norms and of differentiating meaningfully among different Islamic schools.\"--Susan Terrio,Anthropological Quarterly\"Bowen's study gives no quick and easy answers to this question; rather, it does an excellent job of examining the historical background and current developments that highlight the potentials for--as well as the challenges of--a pragmatic convergence between the norms and ideas of Islam and France.\"--Lee Ann Bambach,Journal of Law and Religion\"Bowen once again strengthens his position as one of the leading commentators on the French social landscape. What the study lacks in theoretical rigour is off set by a rigorous and vivid narration of the empirical material and by the author's extensive knowledge of the field. Together withWhy the French Don't Like Headscarves, the English-speaking student of France and Islam will find here an excellent introduction.\"--Per-Erik Nilsson,Temenos", "related": [], "rank": 2719477, "title": "Can Islam Be French?: Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State (Princeton Studies in Muslim Politics Book 30)", "author": "John R.

Since 2007, Otessa's been pioneering the web series format and establishing new ground in the wild west of the web and new media.  She created and directed the much-beloved, and highly-lauded show \"Orange Juice in Bishop's Garden (OJBG)\" when the idea of internet television was still in its infancy. As one of the medium's earliest adopters, she is a true forerunner and pioneer of the wild west of film. Her series, OJBG, is now one of the oldest and longest running web series and continues to release new content. Otessa has been named as a recent Filmmaker of the Month by the DC Office of Motion Picture and Television Development and has been recognized as an ITV Innovator. She organized and hosted the first Web Series Festival in Washington, DC in April 2013 and arranged for the first screening of web series at the 27th Annual Washington, DC International Film Festival (Filmfest DC). The web series is an example of \"writing what you know.\" It's part recollection, part urban legend, part pure fiction, and inspired by her own memories. Otessa's teen years were spent serenaded by Morrissey, listening to mixtapes, and missing the last Metro and getting stuck miles from payphones. This teen magic is what captured her imagination and which she embodies and upholds in her writing and film.  She portrays teen life as it is lived-- dramatic, filled with self-discovery, and the pain and exhilaration of navigating life. Throughout the years, Otessa has been pushing the show-- and the envelope-- to explore themes like sexuality, the feminine experience, and otherness. Much like her OJBG characters, her show represents the lesser-known sides of our nation's capital: the underground culture, local fashion, and indie lore-- AKA \"coaxing Jack and Jill off 'The Hill'\". Also like Otessa, OJBG is thought-provoking and sincere; it embodies the rebelliousness of the ’90s grunge era while tackling social issues that surround youth across the world, such as sexuality, bullying, peer pressure, and intolerance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The three novellas are intriguing and nicely translated. … Highly recommended.”—S.E. Vie, Choice“…Rosny was a species pluralist, and believed that human beings are no more entitled than any other creature to reign supreme.

This is a perky paean to body parts, given from the perspectives of a bunch of very little kids. Naturally, the differences come first. The children have straight, curly, brown, red, long, and short hair, and they’re different colors, too. The text then moves to what the various body parts can do: “I love you, eyebrows— / eyeballs, too! / I like to show / nice things to you.” Davick’s big, bright Photoshop illustrations depict the kids as happy cartoon melon-heads who bop to and fro, pulling the viewer from one spread to the next. Along the way, Davick gently introduces the idea of safety (“Be careful, body! / Whoa, beep, beep! / Make sure to look / before you leap.”) before ending with a few words of thanks: “Body, you’re the one for me. / If not for you . . . / where would I be?” Light, bouncy education for the youngest set.

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, poisoning or simply battering a person to death. As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My first novel, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees' is set in a small town in France. It is published by Author Way Limited. Author Way has already published the next three novels in the series, 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,' ‘Red Light in the Pyrenees’ and 'Dead End in the Pyrenees' as well as a collaboration of short stories called 'Twists and Turns'. As I live in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. When I first arrived in this region I was lulled by the gentle pace of life, the friendliness of the people and the simple charm of the place. But dig below the surface and, like people and places the world over, the truth begins to emerge. Petty squabbles, prejudice, jealousy and greed are all there waiting to be discovered. Oh, and what joy in that discovery. So, as I sit in a café, or stroll by the riverside, or walk high into the mountains in the sunshine I greet everyone I meet with a smile and a 'Bonjour' and, being a friendly place, they return the greeting. I people watch as I sip my wine or when I go to buy my baguette. I discover quirkiness and quaintness around every corner. I try to imagine whether the subjects of my scrutiny are nice or nasty and, once I've decided, some of those unsuspecting people, a very select few, I kill. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim. But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there.

Although Chief Inspector Morrissey, stressed both at home and on the job, is thinking of leaving the force, he musters his deductive skills to find the psychopath responsible. After the bodies of two young women, both associated with the college and both with tumultuous love lives, are found at the bottom of the lake, Morrisey wonders whether he should be looking for one killer or two. He deploys his entire staff, a well-defined crew of ambitious, politically astute policemen, and their progress is thoroughly engrossing. Meanwhile, Morrissey discovers that three of the murdered men were associated in some way with a psychiatric outpatient clinic that had ties to the college. The story suffers some from being chopped a bit too finely into short scenes from many different points of view (including one disquieting first-person voice that may belong to a killer); but Mitchell (Roots of Evil) keeps a secret well, and the answers unfold gradually and forcefully.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Picture Alsatians drawing deeply on a self-rolled cigarette, pondering their views on abortion. Sound a little strange? Well yes, it is  -  considerably so. Then there are the poltergeists, a mystical paddock and a considerable dose of sexual confusion and guilt. If alarm bells are ringing at this point, then no doubt the 200-page novel will prove altogether too weird. But if you're going to give it a miss, then you'll also lose out on some seriously good writing...' - Alice Johnson.  'This is a highly original and unpredictable novel that veers from passages of quirky and sardonic humour to the surreal. George has to endure, as the title suggests, a kind of dark night of the soul during which he descends into a psychosis of gothic proportions.' - Amazon review  'Ciaran's reading was thoughtful yet engaging, poised yet poignant. The beauty of Ciaran's prose is its slow distilling simplicity; the ability to transform an everyday phrase or saying and through its exploration, create something profound or peculiar or both. His use of language makes you want to jump up and down on a trampoline, shouting aloud a word you've said a thousand times before, as if you've just discovered it for the first time.' - Wayne Cleworth", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Both act as prequels to the first volume, with Off With Their Heads portraying how several key characters crossed paths and became what we see them as in the first volume, and Deadland shows what life was like for Alice growing up in her settlement in the Deadland, and the experiences and choices that made her who she is when we encounter her in the first volume.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 66, "rating_average": 4.0455, "rating_total": 267.0}

However, the need to finish her degrees kept her writing private until her desire to write was no longer containable, and she ended her management career to write full-time.

Janet agrees with this advice from Maggie Montclair, “Don’t be afraid to stretch yourself and get out of your comfort zone.

When I was reading the cards many people told me ghost stories, so with their permission these were included. Local papers were always helpful in publishing my appeals for stories, and there was no shortage of people willing to share their ghostly tales. My first ghost booklet Mystical Staffordshire, appeared in the early 1990s. I really only intended writing one, but as it was so popular I wrote another, then another. Numerous ghostly booklets later I combined them into Mysterious Happenings. I have also written other books, Birmingham Girls, Choosing Your Psychic Pathway, Ghosts Angels & Hauntings. I decided to turn my hand to writing fiction in 2007, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience of writing Dancing with Spirits and Spirits of the Lights the sequel. Followed by The Other Place, and Jen's Story,Torn Between Two Times. All of my books apart from Birmingham Girls are full of mystical happenings.", "related": ["B005199VVY"], "rank": 2601738, "title": "A Haunted Past Life (Jen's Story)", "author": "Carol Arnall", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Is it possible not to confuse religion with liberalism while the latter extinguishes itself as the dominant ideology? Can the hope for a radical democracy recognize forms for its realization? And how can hope become a weapon against the continual and ferocious reappearance of conservatism? What does such a revolution of spirit mean when every material condition of freedom is collapsing in the global crisis? Which ethics follows the extinction of the theological-political one? This book opens answers to these questions. None of us can deny searching for the answers to such fundamental problems. With strong arguments, Crockett convinces even me, a committed atheist, that it is necessary to declare it-to come out with it.(Antonio Negri, coauthor ofEmpire)A fresh voice rises from the fray of political theology! Inhabiting the space blasted open by death-of-God theologies, Crockett proposes an incisive alternative to the hollow secularism pretending to expel religion from politics and to the empty transcendence of the return to orthodoxy. With canny courage, his theory produces game-changing criteria for a radical democracy able—potentially—to see us through the crisis our unsustainable civilization will soon face.(Catherine Keller, Drew University, author ofFace of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming)Clayton Crockett, one of the leading lights in the younger generation of radical theologians, applies his considerable theoretical skills and impressive erudition to the political question: what comes after the collapse of secularism, liberalism, and free market euphoria? In a superbly crafted argument, he draws the dark lines of an imminent catastrophe, at once economic, ecological, and political, and imagines the possibility of a radical democracy animated by a radically rethought theology. An urgently needed and important book.(John D. Caputo, Syracuse University, coauther ofAfter the Death of God)A tour de force that should be required reading for theologians, philosophers, and critical, political and economic theorists alike.(Brent A.

Back\nin September I thought it\nmight be a fun exercise to write 30 stories in 30 days...which was\nridiculous, but I set out to do it anyway.Of\ncourse there was no way I could come up with that many ideas in\nadvance. As for outlining? That wasn't going to happen. I mean, it\nwould be hard for anybody--but I can't really write to an outline\nanyway. Mostly what I do is sit and tell myself stories as I go along. If I need\nto figure out what happens next, it's easy: I write whatever I think\nmight be the most fun to read. For me. Oddly, that tends to end up\ncreating some sort of cohesive whole. Eventually, and after a lot of\nrewriting. But it works.So\nI tried another approach. I came up with 30 initial sentences, and\ntold myself I could choose one of them per day. I would come up with\na second sentence that established some sort of tension or conflict\nwith the first, and go on from there. Blindly, I would discover what\nI wanted to write about.Guess\nwhat, though? I didn't write 30 stories.My\nbasic scheme sort of worked, but I would often get to a point where\nit felt right to stop, go to sleep, and see what my fingers felt like\ndoing in the morning. It turned out that I actuallylikedthe\nstories I was writing, and I didn't want to short-change them.So...I\nwrote seven stories in 30 days. And here they are.Some\nare crime fiction, some fantasy, one might be considered science\nfiction if we remember Clarke's Law (\"Any sufficiently advanced\ntechnology is indistinguishable from magic\"), and every single one\nof them is an experiment. In a couple of cases I later wanted to\nchange the initial sentence, but I wouldn't allow myself to do it.I\nhope you enjoy what I came up with. I know I did. And just for fun, most of my initial 30 sentences are included in the book's Afterword.", "related": ["B00AAGANQA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Set in Pittsburgh in the mid-1980s, it chronicles the adversities that beset Timmy, recently laid off from the steel plant, his wife, Pat, and their two daughters, brain-damaged Katie, 11, and her younger sister, Ellen. Through shifting points of view, the narrative movingly portrays Timmy's sense of worthlessness when he is unfairly denied his unemployment check and reduced to sorting through Goodwill items for his family, accepting handouts of food and collecting cans for nickel deposits. Pat feels guilt and frustration as she assumes primary responsibility for Katie and, in the process, overlooks Timmy's and Ellen's needs, as well as her own. When, in desperation, Timmy and a friend attempt to kidnap the mayor of Pittsburgh for a ransom of two jobs, Timmy unexpectedly gains a new perspective on life, and an answer to the question of the title. Krawiec emphasizes that while faith in institutions is ill-founded, belief in individual human sympathy, love and perseverance is not. The kidnapping ploy is far-fetched, and the mayor's response to it will make readers squirm with disbelief; but despite this plot miscalculation, Krawiec credibly limns the hearts and trials of characters worth caring about.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Under the pressure and strain of leading a torn nation, President Lincoln's one escape was spending time with his carefree boys, Willie and Tad.  The boys had the run of the White House--they put on plays in the attic, buried Jack the Doll in the garden, played with their goats, dogs, rabbits and ponies, and generally ran wild with Horatio Nelson Taft's two young sons in tow. During this time, Taft's daughter, Julia, became a daughter of sorts to the President and the First Lady. Julia kept a detailed  journal of her time in the White House, which came to an abrupt end when 12-year-old Willie died of typhoid fever just after President Lincoln's 52nd birthday. In graceful and effortless prose, best-selling Kindle Singles author Cecelia Holland juxtaposes the indefatigable joy that Willie and Tad brought to Lincoln even after Washington DC became a military zone, and the sorrow that he experienced as his closest friends died in the first battles of the war.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00DK8L8Z0"], "rank": 195700, "title": "Lincoln's Little Girl (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Cecelia Holland", "category": "History", "review_number": 50, "rating_average": 4.14, "rating_total": 207.0}

Not afraid to anthropomorphize, she even sees molecules as characters in little plays; the decadence of orchids, she says, would make Oscar Wilde wilt. Other topics introduce the latest discoveries in molecular biology and the work of female scientists.

Katelynn, the older sister, always thinks she knows what's best and never listens to Rosie. Rosie, meanwhile, just won't go along with Katelynn even when it makes no sense not to. They live alone with their mother in a small apartment they recently moved to from the big house they all lived in with their father, George Pursiful, before he went missing. When an unexplained globe turns up at their house one day bearing George's business card and a strange riddle, the girls are plunged headlong into a strange game that begins to explain the mystery of how their father disappeared. Aided by the spinning globe, the girls can be transported instantly to different parts of the world. Soon, the girls are forced to reckon with challenges as fearsome as a tar golem, the Minotaur in its maze, and invisible scorpions in order to defeat a man who holds them hostage in his game. They slowly realize that working together is the only way they can find their way home.   While; the novel may lack in suspense and depth of character, the worlds the girls visit are richly rendered and their grudging affection for one another endearingly sincere.", "related": [], "rank": 2697556, "title": "The Globe eBook", "author": "Stephen Clary", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It really is a city that offers something amusing and entertaining for everyone.The capital and largest city of Thailand is famous for a lot of things. Temples, museums, historical sites, shopping, nightlife, and food are just a few of them. With a desire to cater to both the long term Bangkok resident as well as the short term visitor, within the guide I personally selected a range of different ideas that covers a spectrum of topics.The first section of this Bangkok guide covers exercise and outdoor recreational activities. Did you know you could go fishing, take a bicycle tour of the back streets, or visit Koh Kret Island in the middle of the Chao Phraya River?Bangkok contains entertainment options galore. Whether you're searching for nightlife that never ends, amusement parks for adrenaline thrill rides, or a famous Thai massage, you can find what you're looking for. One of my favorite forms of entertainment in Bangkok is visiting one of the many local floating markets around the city.Aside from food, Bangkok is most famous for its shopping malls and markets. Literally everything you can imagine is available within this extensive labyrinth of indoor and makeshift stalls.Picture Thailand in your head and likely an image of a golden topped temple or palace will pop into your mind. Bangkok is home to the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew, the most sacred site in the country.Love human anatomy? Be sure to go to Siriraj Hospital for a glimpse at the freaky forensic museum of medicine. Want to learn about Jim Thompson and his passion for Thai silk? The Jim Thompson house is a beautiful traditional Thai home located in the heart of the Siam district.In a city that ranks as one of top places to eat in the world, there's no shortage of mouthwatering edibles. Getting to eat all variations of Thai food is one of the biggest joys of visiting Bangkok.The eBook: 101 Things To Do In Bangkok is a guide that includes years of gathering information, countless experiences, and loads of photos, all neatly packaged into a valuable resource. It's not only meant to be a useful list of attractions, but also a book of ideas that will open your eyes to discover the beauty that Bangkok really has to offer!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He’d not had exposure to a business environment since college didn’t give him the opportunity to see how business really works outside of Academia.   He soon found that the personalities he came in contact with sometimes made getting things done harder than they should be.   Jon became an expert in operational efficiencies in an office environment and how personality and conflict affect the way a business runs.  He found that not all conflict is bad, but difficult personalities in the right concentration can severely damage a team’s ability to perform at top levels. Jon started teaching his team and coworkers how to handle conflict to improve working relationships and effectiveness of the organization. Today, Jon works as a consultant and advisor to the top companies around the globe to help them build stronger teams.  Jon teaches managers how to handle difficulties and be proactive to set up organizations that are less vulnerable to the kind of problems that cause the most stress for the workforce.", "related": ["B00BB7Z89Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

It was easier than trying to 1) find more actors or 2) searching for a script with the right numbers and gender of cast members.Most of my scripts have been for children to perform or see performed for them. When I wrote scripts for children to be in the plays, I tried to make the cast flexible in number and gender. I never knew how many kids I would get at auditions. It would be a) 40, or b) 6. It made selecting a script rather difficult.Then one day a grandma said to me, \"Do you have any scripts for two kids? I watch my grandkids after school and they would love to be able to perform something.\" I'm wondering if that was what Grandma wanted more than the kids but, hey, one never knows.Finally, I began to write short scripts for kids because 1) I needed something to take to my writer's critique group, and 2) I was tired of writing nothing but monologues and 30-min shows for casts of six to 40.I must declare that adapting tales so two or three children can perform them is quite taxing on the creative process!

Still restless he searched for a wilder place  and in the spring of ‘65 headed north to Alaska and ﬁ nally found  what he was looking for.  A land still open, wild and free. Since that time he has trapped, guided, and prospected all over the  frozen north, from the southeast to the Brooks Range, and everyplace  in between, all the time with his wife and partner of forty years  raising their four boys with correspondence courses for their school  work. Today, Frank, with Carol and two dogs, lives in a small log cabin  along a remote river accessible only by boat and plane.  He still  lives a subsistence lifestyle and will until his last day.", "related": ["B00L826G5W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So I decided that once I had a very good understanding of how the self-publishing world operated, I'd write my own guide and make it more of a conversation than a lecture.As you might infer from the title, this guide is based on my personal experiences and highlights the mistakes that I made along the way.  It certainly wasn't a pretty trip, but in the end I know more than I should about how to troubleshoot and correct problems when it comes to self-publishing!As both a novelist and a children's picture book author, I wanted this guide to cover both topics, so there's a chapter dedicated to the formatting of both novels and picture books.

After his first and\nonly book is a total failure and his girlfriend leaves him, things get even\nworse: His crude, low-quality writing is a big hit in Hell, so the Devil has\nhim killed to write more hackwork for the damned. The outraged Ate refuses to\nfulfill the Devil's wishes and goes on the run, making his way across a Hell\nthat the world of the living never warned him about. While Ate desperately tries to dodge Hell's\npitfalls, he deals with a cavalcade of absurd, damned souls who all have their\nown agendas--and some of them are his fans.The entire narrative is irreverent fun, with mild overtones of Kurt\nVonnegut and Tom Robbins. The pacing is fast and breezy, and the author does an\nadmirable job of designing and describing his version of Hell and the fantastic\nrules that shape it. His clever, funny tale slyly points fingers at American\noutlooks and attitudes, although readers who are sensitive to profanity may not\nfind this book to their liking. An\nentertaining, inventive and occasionally over-the-top fantasy novel.\" - Kirkus Reviews", "related": ["B00E8C2EFA"], "rank": 3255768, "title": "Written in Hell", "author": "Jason Helford", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She dreamed of being a published writer from a very young age, submitting many pointless stories to children’s magazines for consideration, her father all the while secretly copying them and mailing them to relatives. She dabbled in many industries in her twenties, finally setting out to do her intended career at thirty: teaching English. Kristine spent much of her teens and twenties in the DC area where this novel is set. Then she moved to Okinawa, Japan and taught at middle schools and a high school on American military bases, thus fulfilling another dream of hers: overseas adventure as an adult. She met her husband while there. At 37, she moved to the States to be an Air Force wife. She wrote Big Toe People shortly after their honeymoon and has been editing it as changes in duty stations, teaching community college English, and parenting have allowed. She and her pilot husband adopted two sons, one in 2011 and the other in 2012. Ms. Kohut has an undergraduate degree in English with a Writing concentration and an M.Ed. for teaching Secondary English, both from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. More pertinent to the content of this novel, however, is her long stint of singlehood. There’s plenty of material in her past to draw upon for inspiring chick novels, that’s for sure.", "related": ["B00JMORVM0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He's the author of the Galvanic Century series of Steampunk Thrillers, the literary apocalyptic short story collection Grief, and the supernatural serial Profane Apotheosis.In 2012 Michael wrote the pilot for the atmospheric horror transmedia web-series Sleep Study. After two years of hiatus, the series is in pre-production again under the umbrella of his own Chicago-based production company Burning Brigid.", "related": ["B00LMTMBRS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I lived my life changing it every 5 years, by choice, by case, by faith. In my life I did pretty much everything, from running the family’s furniture shop in my hometown, to travel around Europe as a sales agent, from manage an insurance agency in a small town, to became an Internet Marketing specialist. I am a sailor and I served my country both into the Navy and the Army. I see the amazing and the nasty, I sailed different Maxi Cups in Porto Cervo among the wealthiest and the most unimaginable luxury, I saw the horrors and the atrocity of the war first hand.  Everything I did, I lived, I learned, made me who I am today, the very same person as I was when I started, a complete new one as my life taught me to be.  In the end I became a writer, because too many are the things I want to say, too many are the things I need to share. My first novel “Ancient Truth” of the book series “Line of Blood Saga”, despite its obvious reference to the worlds of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, it is actually a journey inside something impalpable as well, and yet so real; the human soul. We are not “part of the picture”, we are masters, keepers, lords of this universe, our right is to choose, our responsibility is to do it wisely. This is the ultimate gift the supreme Intelligence gave us, this is why and what we are. The point, my point, is not pretending to have all the answers, it is simply to keep having the will to look for them.", "related": ["B00KY514H4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}
