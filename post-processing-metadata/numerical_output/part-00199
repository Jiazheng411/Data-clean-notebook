The Master Swing Trader contains a wealth of practical insights and information for using this powerful trading method to profit from short-term price moves often missed by other market participants. After beginning with a detailed background on Pattern Cycle applications and the trend-range axis, The Master Swing Trader presents:* Dozens of specific trading strategies and setups that include precise reward, risk, and stop-loss considerations* Concrete tips, tactics, and workflows to make informed choices at each stage of short-term trade evolution* The 7 Bells – unique tools to uncover high-probability short-term trading prospectsWith more than 200 charts and dozens of proprietary setups that illustrate both classic and highly original short-term tactics, The Master Swing Trader doesn’t leave your trading profits to chance. Coldly analytical and backed by real-time trading results, this proven course for short-term traders will help you improve your bottom line, lessen your risks—and increase your confidence in building solid profits in today’s volatile markets!Biased news stories spun by insiders to manipulate options prices…Questionable stocks pushed by analysts so their trading departments can unload bloated inventories … Quick-trigger day traders chasing the latest chat room buzz …Today’s top market players understand that our \"efficient\" markets are actually highly inefficient, driven by insiders with hidden agendas and an irrational pack mentality that has little to do with underlying value. Fortunately, this constant imbalance generates repeated, high-probability trade setups—and Alan Farley’s The Master Swing Trader reveals how you can find and profit from these difficult-to-spot opportunities before they disappear.Farley’s innovative system is based on Pattern Cycles—shifting market stages that repeat in an orderly, predictable process through all price charts and time frames. These classic Pattern Cycles:* Describe the machine language within market opportunity* Reveal the origin of the trade setup* Explain how to capitalize on inefficiency through every bull and bear phase* Show exactly where to uncover consistent profit opportunities* Offer natural methods to shift tactics quickly as conditions change* Predict the impact of the emotional crowd on trend, range, and price developmentThe Master Swing Trader will help you apply Pattern Cycles to your advantage, over and over again. By encompassing virtually all market action, and revealing how price moves in a highly predictable manner, its powerful tools will give you the edge you need to take other people’s money before they take yours.In today’s lightning-fast markets, open information makes profit opportunities decidedly more difficult to spot and capitalize upon—with the investing herd becoming far more skilled at spotting inefficiencies and closing them up quickly. The Master Swing Trader will teach you to recognize these trade setups one step ahead of the crowd, dive in for solid profits, and close out your position before the majority has even caught on.Pattern Cycles are not easy or automatic; they require concentration, discipline, and skilled execution. But the payoff of these classic strategies is virtually unlimited.

Elkins (Sch. of the Art Inst. of  Chicago; What Painting Is) asks why some people cry in front of  paintings. Using both historical sources and solicited examples,  he spins out various generally unconvincing hypotheses.  Admitting that he himself has never cried in front of a  painting, Elkins fails to get to the heart of the matter. Noting  that other forms of expression (theater, music, novels, film)  are more likely to elicit tears, Elkins attempts to explain  their absence in our own time as a peculiarity of the 20th  century. The examples of contemporary tears that Elkins resents  are largely self-selected (solicited through ads in various  publications) and neither prove nor disprove his theories. A  rambling and often obtuse style makes this already rather  intangible topic even more slippery.

This noise results from the combination of wishful thinking on the part of research and industry and a lack of clear understanding of how Web services came to be. These factors make it extremely difficult to get a coherent picture of what Web services are, what they contribute, and where they will be applied.    Based on their academic and industrial experience in middleware and enterprise application integration, Alonso and his co-authors clarify the fundamental concepts behind Web services and present them as the natural evolution of conventional middleware necessary to meet the challenges of the Web and of B2B application integration. From this perspective, it becomes clear why Web services are needed and how this technology addresses such needs.    Rather than providing a reference guide or a manual on how to write a Web service, the authors discuss challenges and solutions that will remain relevant regardless of how emerging standards and technologies evolve. Thus, this book is ideally suited for both professionals involved in application integration projects and researchers and students interested in understanding and contributing to the evolution of application integration technologies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

McCabe is no stranger to literature. She graduated from Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1973 with a B.A. in English Literature and Philosophy. In 1990, she graduated from SUNY The College at New Paltz with a B.A. in Applied Music, Piano. Ms. McCabe worked at the Mid-Hudson Library System, Poughkeepsie, New York, during the time she worked toward her second degree. While there, she reviewed for The Children's Book Review Service. Upon graduation, Ms. McCabe operated a private piano instruction studio for fifteen years in the Hudson Valley. During that time, she began work on her four novels, and has devoted twenty-five years to dedicated research, editing, and revision. Her characters are drawn from real historical figures and are firmly planted within their real historical times. Ms. McCabe's novels are the product of extensive research and artistic imagination. The creative imagery in each of her four historical romance novels is set around one of the four ancient Alchemic symbols that govern life on earth: THE SHADOW OF THE PHOENIX: fireNORTHWIND: airAXIOS: earthTHE HIGHEST DESTINY: water In a recent interview, Ms. McCabe was asked to comment upon the inspiration for her books. Her reply was that every true romance novel revolves around the author's personal definition of what love is and how it manifests itself. The author chose the four elemental symbols that govern life on earth because, while we can't live without them, they are ultimately beyond our ability to control them. When they arise in all their power, they cause great destruction, but they also create new conditions for new ways of life. It is a concept that the author finds fascinating. Two of her books are currently in print and available through AuthorHouse. Ms. McCabe now lives in central New York with her husband and her beloved Miniature Poodles and Cocker Spaniels.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She shows conclusively that the attempts of a long series of scholars to find Jesus affirming women's leadership in some way have entirely failed. Surely this is an important cautionary tale for our times.\"—J. I. Packer,Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College\"Who is Jesus? Was he a chauvinist? A feminist crusader? Or an egalitarian emancipator of women? In this significant work, Marny Köstenberger investigates whether the portraits of Jesus painted by proponents of women's equality truly fit the Gospel narrative. Her analysis of underlying hermeneutics is careful and concise. Her conclusions, balanced and well-reasoned. Is Jesus who they say he is? This is a valuable resource for all who seek to answer this all-important question.\"—Mary A. Kassian, Professor of Women's Studies, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; author,Girls Gone Wise in a World Gone Wild\"Feminism has left its imprint on virtually every aspect of Western culture, including the Christian faith and the interpretation of the Scriptures. Margaret Köstenberger expertly surveys the scholarly work of feminists on the person of Jesus Christ. We are treated to the entire landscape of feminist scholarship on Jesus, from radical feminists to egalitarian evangelicals. Most important, Köstenberger subjects the claims of feminist scholarship to critical scrutiny, showing that they fail to measure up with the teaching of Scripture. Köstenberger's criticisms are irenic, but at the same time they show the deficiencies of the feminist paradigm.\"—Thomas R. Schreiner,James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary\"All interested in the development of feminism in the 20th century will greatly appreciate the excellent scholarship and fair descriptive analysis offered by Margaret Köstenberger. Evangelicals in particular will applaud the effort to set the record straight on Jesus. Numerous feminist distortions of Jesus and his own understanding and treatment of women are discussed with care, while showing them to be far from the gospels' own portrayal, rightly understood. The role of hermeneutics is central in this discussion, and Jesus and the Feminists provides an excellent case-study on just why a correct hermeneutic matters. Even more to the point: getting Jesus right matters! Köstenberger should be commended for winsome and scholarly dismantling of feminist distortions of Jesus thus providing assistance toward this goal.\"—Bruce A. Ware,Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary\"Margaret Köstenberger succeeds at bringing historical perspective to bear on feminist understanding of Scripture and Christ. Her analyses of radical, reformist, and evangelical wings of this movement are methodical, clear, thorough, and mature. Her findings are highly significant. They force the question: Is Jesus Lord over Western culture's ideologies or their servant? Today a new generation stands poised to replace the aging leaders who ushered feminism into our churches. Köstenberger points the way to honor their concerns while avoiding their unjustified concessions.\"—Robert W. Yarbrough,Professor of New Testament, Covenant Theological Seminary\"Margaret Elizabeth Köstenberger has done a remarkable job in linking carefully documented scholarly research with very practical conclusions in such a way as to enable students and scholars to explore what interpretations feminists are peddling in the marketplace of ideas. Even lay women who have questions and personal struggles with the bombardment of post-modernism will be able to profit from Köstenberger's readable style and practical approach to issues of the day. Her clear and concise charts are a ready and easily understood tool for satisfying a reader's curiosity about the feminists whose works are reviewed as well as presenting in a graphic format that aids in personal understanding and teaching others a synopsis of the issues feminists are bringing to the forefront for discussion. Her table of contents is almost an index at the beginning to help the reader 'scratch where it itches.' The bibliography is comprehensive, and the footnotes are explicit and clear documentation of the material she presents. I am grateful to have such a resource to use as textbook and supplementary reading for my classes in women's studies and for recommendation on questions that come through my website and women in the churches.\"—Dorothy Kelley Patterson, Professor, Theology in Women's Studies, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\"Karl Barth spoke of finding a 'strange new world' in the Bible. Nothing could seem stranger or newer to the ambient culture than a biblical understanding of manhood and womanhood. In this insightful and winsome book, Margaret Elizabeth Köstenberger shows that the debate over feminism is not, first of all, about whose name has 'Reverend' in front of it. It is, first of all, and last of all, 'about Jesus.' Those wishing to engage the feminist culture all around us will find an excellent resource in this volume.\"—Russell D. Moore,President, The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission; author,Tempted and Tried\"This book is an exceptionally valuable guide to feminist writings about Jesus. It summaries the entire history of feminist interpretation, summarizing each author fairly and then providing a thoughtful critique. Köstenberger's patient, clear argument shows that the multiple feminist re-interpretations of Jesus are inconsistent with the actual text of the Gospels. She also provides excellent summary charts throughout. A very useful, readable resource for those who want to understand how feminism has continually reinterpreted the Bible to advance its own agenda.\"—Wayne Grudem,Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies, Phoenix Seminary\"This book is a helpful resource for every woman who has a genuine desire to more thoroughly understand the theological implications of feminism and what the Bible actually says about Jesus. This meaty material is well worth the time to read and consider, as no question is more important than who Jesus is.\"—Carolyn McCulley, author, Radical Womanhood: Feminine Faith in a Feminist WorldandDid I Kiss Marriage Goodbye? Trusting God with a Hope Deferred.  \"Jesus and the Feminists is a highly useful work which canvasses both the non-evangelical and evangelical feminists. It is carefully written, easy to read, and provides a much needed resource for understanding the hermeneutics of various feminist works. Anyone who seeks to understand the feminist movement in the church and the complex arguments concerning the role of women in the church would benefit from this volume.\"—M. Sydney Park,Assistant Professor of Divinity (New Testament), Beeson Divinity School\"This is an outstanding, comprehensive study of Feminist hermeneutic. It extensively deals with the historical development of feminism, the variety of feminist positions, and the development within each position. It shows that the results one gets from the Bible heavily depend on the view one holds on the Bible. It also makes meaningful use of internal feminist critique, and shows that mainly because of views taken on the Bible, it is impossible for conservative evangelical theology ever to accept any of the variety of views held within feminism.\"—Adrio Konig,Emeritus Professor of Systematic Theology, University of South Africa\"The strength of this manuscript lies in the way it surveys the main figures of English-language theological feminism, carefully noting developments, differences, and trends. I know of no survey to compare with it. The hermeneutical analysis at each step is introductory, accessible, and sensible. Highly recommended.\"—D. A.

Almost every one of these businesses will transfer ownership at some point in time, the vast majority through an outright sale of the company. But those responsible for handling transactions involving companies with intangible value are often faced with a number of hard questions: How will the buyer perceive value? In which sectors can the best buyers be found? Can the right investment banker add value to the transaction?In Selling the Intangible Company, Thomas Metz helps entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to better understand the process and nuances of selling a company whose value is strategic. He addresses all the key issues surrounding the sale of a company in which the value is in its technology, its software, and its know-how—but has not yet shown up on its balance sheet.Metz reveals the important subtleties surrounding the sale of companies whose value is strategic, such as how selling a company with strategic value is different than selling a company with financial value, and why small transactions have different dynamics than large transactions. He identifies the best time to consider selling and debunks many of the common myths surrounding the sale process. Drawing from his twenty-five years of experience in this area, Metz offers invaluable advice on negotiating the price of an intangible company, identifies common negotiating mistakes, and examines the pros and cons of the sale of stock versus a sale of assets. He also looks at transaction currency alternatives and how creative structuring can overcome unusual deal problems. In addition, he tells how to select an investment banker, attorney, and accountant—and explains why a CEO should not sell the company himself.Deals such as these can be a complex, sometimes perplexing process. Selling the Intangible Company provides the essential information necessary for business professionals and technology CEOs who need to understand the nuances of selling a company with intangible value.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You will begin to feel that you too are a member of Engine 33, Ladder 9, and, after George's promotion to lieutenant, of some of Brooklyn's busiest fire companies. It is an empowering feeling, until you suddenly realise that these are among the very first fire companies who will arrive one fateful day in their future at the World Trade Center, providing our city with more courage, determination, and selflessness that we ever knew we had.

Musing at various moments during the years from 1918 to 1941 as we come to know them here, Mrs. Woolf saw her diary as a \"kindly, blankfaced old confidante\", a quarry of precious memories to which she might return for sustenance, a place where she practiced writing - like doing her scales - and where she really almost wrote her books. The confidences we see are esentially literary and yet at the core of her being as she lives through the long pull of writing with its driving excitement, sinks on the peak of achievement when a book is done to worry at what L. and the others will say, worry and waive the criticism which falls from her as she loses herself in another work already projected. We witness the growth of her powers and extension of her exploration as the novels themselves rise before us, from the days of Jacob's Room through the consuming Waves to the further voyage of The Years To be a writer meant to be a sensibility, an interesting novelist, perhaps, to be driven to write for what goal - a queer individuality?- always to analyse oneself... reading and criticism formed an important part of her life: we see her steeped in Shakespeare, coming to him with \"mind agape and red-hot\" to feel him out-distance her, remarking on Proust's utmost sensibility and tenacity, drawing strength and separateness from the classics. And all the time her works of criticism, her contacts with the figures of the literary world - Bennett, Hardy, Elizabeth Bowen, Maynard Keynes, and the others, weave in and out of her inner life. Virginia Woolf, novelist, critic, person, comes to us with all the brilliance, perceptiveness, and restraint we could wish for her, and we are privileged to have her so.

While in Cincinnati, his profiles of interesting and original people connected him with a variety of subjects. Interviews ranged from Lou Jacobs, who for decades was the image of the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus, to physicist Edward Teller, who admitted he hated being called the father of the hydrogen bomb, to Neil Armstrong, first human to walk on the moon.  Building on that remarkable start, John was enthralled when he saw the early tests of what would become the space shuttle. He moved to Houston and spent the next several years covering the manned space program. John is also a private pilot, so he combined his knowledge of aviation with the love of a good story and soon became known as one of the most respected reporters covering exploration. He flew the space shuttle simulator, worked in real spacesuits, participated in scientific tests that later flew in space and spent more than 200 minutes in zero gravity. He ultimately became NASA’s reporter-of-choice for pool coverage of activities aboard the famous “Vomit Comet” or Zero-G airplane. He flew with countless astronauts, mission specialists and politicians. The crew of the final ill-fated flight of the Challenger considered John a personal friend. He built on these connections to become personally acquainted with every surviving moonwalker and was a major player hosting each of them in the official 20th anniversary celebrations of the Apollo program at Johnson Space Center.  His reports were regularly featured by CBS News and CNN and seen in more than 135 countries. Recognizing his experience and insights, John was recruited to join SPACEHAB as a senior vice president for Space Media Inc. He developed and managed plans for construction of what would have been the first dedicated media facility aboard the International Space Station. With staff in the United States and Russia, he was involved in several commercial space missions using the shuttle, Soyuz, MIR and International Space Stations.  John has also consulted with major corporations, industry and political leaders on effective communications skills, media understanding and, of course, storytelling. He now lives in Las Vegas where he enjoys the desert, is very active in rescuing Doberman Pinschers, produces news and television content, consults with clients and still tells stories such as these.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": 918022, "title": "ebook,John Getter,TO THE MOON - Untold Stories of the Space Race (Moonwalkers(tm) Book 1),Premiere Projects Digital Publishing,SCIENCE / History,SCIENCE / Physics / Astrophysics\" />", "author": "John Getter", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In spite of this—or perhaps because of it—her biographers seem to have considerable trouble agreeing on much else about her life.  She was born either April 26 or April 28 and lived in Circleville, Ohio, until she was six [3] or eight, when the family moved to South Bend, Indiana.  Except for a year at school in Philadelphia, she lived in South Bend until 1853, when she was twenty-five, possibly teaching in Indiana schools from 1851-1853. In 1853, her parents or father died, and she moved either to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to teach, or to New York for a year.   In 1854, she either moved to an unspecified town in Pennsylvania, to write for the Presbyterian Publishing Board. Martha Finley is best known for her Elsie Dinsmore series, melodramatic and sentimental fiction focusing on Elsie's trials and the solace offered her by her religious beliefs. Originally written under the pseudonym \"Martha Farquharson\" (Gaelic for \"Finley\"), the series lasted for 28 volumes, published over a period of 38 years. Much has been written about the series, discussing everything from its tear-soaked heroine and her relationship with her father to its enduring popularity during the 19th century. Elsie, however, was only a little over a quarter of Ms. Finley's total works. A second series, Mildred Keith, ran for seven volumes and chronicles the life of Mildred Keith and her family as well providing glimpses of Elsie Dinsmore's early years. Mildred is a slightly more realistic character than Elsie, with spunk and independence and without Elsie's perpetual penchant for tears and Biblical quotations.  Martha Finley also wrote more than fifty short books or pamphlets, primarily for children, which were published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication and/or the Presbyterian Publishing Committee. The majority of these appeared between 1856 and 1876 in series or as individual volumes. Their titles and publishers suggest that they, too, were didactic literature, with a strong emphasis on religion.  Much of Martha Finley's writing was quickly forgotten, but Elsie persevered for over seventy-five years. In 1945, the first 12 volumes were still in print in the United States and England and had sold over 5,000,000 million copies.", "related": ["B00GLSFJTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It concerns a small, idyllic Pennsylvania community, Dreamthorp, that has sprung up not far from a wooded area that covers an old Indian burial ground. After a protective talisman is removed from the burial ground by a fortune hunter, sudden and inexplicable violence erupts in Dreamthorp. The plot revolves around three characters: recently widowed art teacher and amateur woodworker Tom Brewer; Laura Stark, an advertising woman with doubts about her sexuality; and Gilbert Rodman, a homicidal young man of Indian descent whose crosscountry killing spree finally takes him to Dreamthorp in pursuit of Laura. Tom and Laura fall in love, but as they are building a relationship, Dreamthorp is disintegrating around them. Williamson's story gradually loses impact, and he fails to draw a believable or esthetically resonant connection between Gilbert Rodman and the vengeful spirits of the dead Indians. While quite readable and full of memorably violent moments, it doesn't add up to much.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Technical writer Alex Phillips agrees to be hypnotized by his sister Maddy, a blind paraplegic clinical psychologist, to see if his subconscious holds any clues to the murder of his former lover Toni, a still-unsolved crime that he witnessed. Enigmatic Maddy takes Alex back a few months to the moment when Toni asks for his help, appearing in Minneapolis following the drowning of her sister Liz. Although the police label it suicide, Toni believes Liz was killed and convinces Alex to help her delve into her sister's affairs, which turn out to include a former boyfriend involved in a weird cult that may be responsible for the ritual killings of four young women. Slowly Alex's retelling arrives at Toni's murder, and although he didn't see the killer's face, his account provides Maddy with an invaluable clue. The author nicely integrates his frequent flashbacks into the narrative, which disappoints only with its contrived ending.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then, go to my childhood, parenthood, many exciting careers, etc. etc. etc. However, it didn't take too long for me to decide the categories overlap in too many places. Hence, the chronological format of a life of a \"river rat\" born somewhat infamously in 1932 on the banks of Memphis. A few years later Elvis Presley arrived on the planet and eventually became internationally famous there. Memphis, long known as the \"Home of the Blues\" was to become also famous as the home of the \"King of Rock 'n' Roll\" My first high school, Whitehaven, is only a few blocks from Elvis' Graceland. And, my Southside High \"bride\" and I began training our dancing shoes to the big bands of the 40s and peaked with the rocking and twisting of the 50s and 60s. Although only a senior-to-be in high school, the Korean War found me an early enlistee. Why? Because I was a youngster almost entering teenage during World War II. Everything was thrilling about the \"big one\" for a boy that age. All the toys were guns, tanks, jeeps, warplanes, etc. The war movies were always exciting and, in most cases, the hero ended up with the female star. As I was a young budding teenager, females were becoming of more interest in my life. I have never met any male whose sex life began earlier than mine (older girls are great teachers). Also, the U.S. Navy aircraft pilots were my idols. Landing airplanes on a sea-going vessel was my kind of challenge. I was so \"hooked\" that I joined the Navy to become a fighter pilot. The recruiter was surprised at how I could identify all aircraft of nations involved in WWII. I even memorized the horsepower of power plant(s), plus the cruising and maximum speed, of each airplane. My favorite was our Corsair's F4U, a gull-winged propeller", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ray, Naropa University, author ofIndestructible TruthandSecret of the Vajra World\"Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, a preeminent Tibetan master, has presented an accessible and precise introduction to the inherently awakened mind at the heart of confusion and suffering. While this text is invaluable for the scholar, it is even more crucial for the Vajrayana practitioner.\"—Judith Simmer-Brown, PhD, Professor, Naropa University\"Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche is among the wisest and most compassionate Buddhist masters alive today. I have no doubt that this book will be a great inspiration and support for all serious Dharma students who read it and put it into practice.\"—Pema Chödrön, author ofWhen Things Fall Apart\"With the help of this introduction to Buddhist psychology, successful meditation practice is distinctly possible. . . . Distinctively clear and vivid.\"—Mandala Magazine\"There is no shortage of brief introductions to Buddhist practice, especially from the Tibetan Buddhist perspective. What makes Rinpoche's work distinctive is the clarity and vividness of his religious thought. Rinpoche attempts to concretize the notions of five levels of awareness in the reader's mind by correlating each with a different 'Buddha-family,' accessible through correct mediation. There is also a helpful Tibetan (transliterated)-English glossary to assist the non-Tibetan reader through the forest of religious terminology. Recommended for most collections, especially where interest in Buddhism or the Dalai Lama is strong.\"—Library Journal", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He rose from a humble background to complete his geshe studies at Sera Je Monastic University in Lhasa with highest honors and was privileged to serve as a debate opponent for the Dalai Lama's own geshe examination in 1959. He moved to New Jersey in the United States in 1963 and in 1967 began teaching in the Buddhist Studies Program at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is now professor emeritus. In 1975, he founded the Deer Park Buddhist Center in Oregon, Wisconsin, site of the Dalai Lama's first Kalachakra initiation granted in the West. He is the author of several books in English, including the five-volume comprehensive teaching,Steps on the Path to Englightenment.Beth Newman received her PhD in South Asian Languages and Literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She teaches at Ringling School of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida, and is the translator ofThe Tale of the Incomparable Prince.Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language, his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world. His efforts to foster dialogue among leaders of the world's faiths envision a future where people of different beliefs can share the planet in harmony. Wisdom Publications is proud to be the premier publisher of the Dalai Lama's more serious and in-depth works.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One as a sensible, hard-working type, employed in financial systems, graphic design and web site development. Another as a writer, scribbling away, committing her stories to disc and eventually publishing several to reasonable acclaim. Throughout all of them, the mother of two and wife of one. Skilled at exploring the psychology and interior lives of her characters, Alison delivers stories that range from chilling tales of horror through insightful contemporary drama to thought-provoking science fiction. Her empathy with her protagonists, her rich descriptive prose and her use of gentle humour serve to ensure that, whatever the setting, her stories are always a rewarding read.  Neil Faarid: Neil Faarid was born in the North of the UK, in a small town you've probably never heard of. He studied in Leeds but, after three years, decided he didn't like flat caps and moved away. Hoping to write a novel or two, Neil now lives in Oxford where he enjoys being unmarried and having no pets. Neil likes to write both sci-fi and fantasy, and has a few more stories he's working on, though The Adventures of Kit Brennan is the first to be published. He also likes to listen to music and doodle. Neil is not his real name.  Gingerlily: So you want to know something about me? You nosy lot! Well what can I tell you... Age?  -  Old enough to know better by now (or so my Mum says). In fact old enough to be a grandmother if I had got around to having children at any stage. Work?  -  well I do some, but it's so boring you would fall asleep if I told you, so make something up yourself, it'll be much more fun. In fact  -  write and tell me about it to alleviate the boredom of my job! Interests? - reading, photography, reading, playing guitar, reading, Formula 1, Dragon taming, Underwater knitting... Are you still reading? Last life lesson learned  -  There is no such thing as a quick game of Angry Birds before I catch my bus. I will miss the bus. And probably the next one as well. And I can get by on 4 hours sleep.  Robin Moran: The Merry Maiden Wails is Robin Moran's first published work. Born in Yorkshire she happily resides in Leeds after finally escaping the insanity and chaos of London although Cyberdog and South Bank are greatly missed. Horror is her comfort zone, having read twisted tales and bone chilling stories since she was young so it's no surprise it has warped her writing mind. By day she's a teaching assistant, watching over children who enjoy screaming 'TEACHER' in her face. By night she writes and occasionally gets distracted by her Draenei Shaman, Medua, who is not impressed by Robin's writing and desperately wants to reach level 85.  PR Pope: Accidentally pushed through a time-space warp as a child, PR Pope found himself in our dimension. Lucky enough to find a surrogate family in his exile, he had a fairly normal upbringing: school, university, research institute, international prizes. Drawing on his innate technological superiority over earthlings, he proceeded to 'discover' many of the advances that we take for granted in a modern networked society - frequently passing the credit to others to avoid arousing suspicion. In the process he made and lost a fortune, but is nevertheless still happy. He has decided now is the time to commit to print some of the tales with which he was weaned on his home planet.  Alexander Skye: Alexander Skye has been obsessed with sci-fi since before he was born. Since those early experiments with time travel, he has read and enjoyed every branch of science fiction; from the most realistic of hard SF, through the most cynical of cyberpunk and the most Victorian of steampunk, to the most exuberant of space opera. He's enjoyed other genres besides, most especially fantasy, with which he has had a long- running affair. It began as a child, reading The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Lord of the Rings, and has never really abated. His first and greatest love, however, will always be science fiction. Having spent so long merely reading and admiring, he decided that it was finally time to try and tell his own stories and hopefully you'll enjoy them as much as he enjoyed writing them; if not, he'll be forced to find a different job, which would be tragic since they're all so boring - after all, how many other professions let you stare wistfully at the stars on a cloudless night and call it research?  Peter Wolfe: Peter Wolfe lives the life of a hermit, desperately trying to avoid the mysterious and terrifying 'Real World', preferring instead the varying realities that inhabit his bookshelf and his mind. Peter lives in Leeds with his girlfriend and their cat, who has the joint function of being Emperor of the Known Universe and Chief Editor. His Lordship seems to disapprove of Peter's writing, forever stealing his pens and or leaving indecipherable comments by walking across the keyboard. 'If you go into the woods today...' is Peter's first published work, though with luck many more Science Fiction and Fantasy stories will soon follow. On a more personal note Peter finds writing about himself in the third person quite peculiar and fears that if he doesn't stop soon he might do a Jack Torrance.

More!-- carol555 Stars--Fabulous Opening. Truly funny. I really enjoyed this book. Loved Jane and Ty (who is mega-sexy!)

Without ever getting maudlin, Francie is variously sad, or angry, or fearful, or in denial. She meets fellow cancer patient Joel Goldman while both await radiation, and as they share experiences and insights, a spark is struck. Francie's only relation is her Great-Uncle Sol, an 87-year-old who lives in an assisted living home surrounded by Christian widows he refers to as 'the Marys and the Marias.' Francie's sparky humor spices the pages, while her feelings about Uncle Sol, cantankerous as he is, swing between affection and dread when she thinks about him meeting Joel or Joel's family. The author has crafted a fine story that recognizes how the little things often throw you the most, even when you're dealing with major issues. The author is wise not to wrap this engaging novel in a happy-ever-after ending, instead allowing some questions to linger. It's a refreshing entry to the very clogged sub-genre of cancer lit. \"--Publishers Weekly(this text refers to the 2010 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award)", "related": ["B00HW4602Y"], "rank": 1377062, "title": "Bring Back My Body to Me eBook", "author": "Rita Ciresi", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I want some hint, some dream, some will o’ the  wisp that seems to connect matter and mind in a way that I can run with.  With my training in quantum physics, I reject all glib and easy  analogies. I want somethinghard—the quantum philosopher's  stone. Grossinger’s material takes the mind down strange corridors it  would never have discovered for itself. And the most important thing his  writings do is towake us upto the mystery that we are every moment living.…\"—Nick Herbert, author ofElemental Mind: Human Consciousness and the New Physics\"Grossinger has a great synthetic mind and is a master of poetic prose and imaginative, free-ranging scholarship.\"—Michael J. Harner, author ofThe Way of the Shaman\"Richard Grossinger is one of the most original spiritual writers of our time.\"—Andrew Harvey, author ofHeart YogaandThe Hope\"I think what Grossinger has written here is historic and momentous and game-changing. He has used science, turned it on its head, and aimed his sights on materialism, atheism, and even dualism. Reading this mind- and gut-wrenching book has left me with but one conclusion: the author is a goddamn … genius. I cannot even begin to fathom how he set about writing this.” —Joshua Laudermilk, philosopher", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has written a number of plays, screenplays and, most recently, novels. Massara lives in Sydney, Australia, with all of her novel characters crammed inside her head waiting to come out and express themselves. As a multi-genre author, Massara draws on her varied experience from having worked in the field of human resources across many industries including the glamorous world of hotels.One of Massara's favourite genres is romance -- romantic comedy -- and she has a soft spot for older chicks who are in their 40s and beyond. One of her novels, \"The Other Boyfriend\", is loosely based on her own life experience whilst she lived in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Massara followed through with \"Like Casablanca\", another romantic comedy about internet dating, and she drew on some of her own experiences as she went in search of \"the one\" (whom, by the way, she never found). On a more serious note, Massara wrote a very touching general fiction drama, \"The Soul Bearers\", which touches on issues of child abuse, AIDS and gay rights; a story inspired by real life events and filled with hope and inspiration when overcoming fear, loss, and betrayal while learning to live and love again. At present, the novel is under consideration for adaptation into a feature film.An avid fan of classic black and white Hollywood movies of the 40s including film noir, Massara has recently embarked on a contemporary mystery series whose protagonist is an older, spunky and wiseass chick at 48, and who works in the international world of hotels. The theme is comedic, sprinkled with a little bit of film noir, and the stories are fast-paced and set in the modern day world. The first novel in the series is \"Playing With The Bad Boys\" -- A Mia Ferrari mystery. Massara is now working on her second mystery \"The Gay Mardi Gras Murders\".", "related": ["B009DQ3LK8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

Wesentliche Teile ihres Werkes schrieb sie schon als Teenager, wobei die Buchveröffentlichung eine Dekade später erfolgte. 1802 lehnte sie den Heiratsantrag eines Verehrers ab, und blieb unverheiratet. – Ihre letzten Lebensjahre verbrachte sie als etablierte Schriftstellerin in einem Landhaus in der kleinen Ortschaft Chawton; Jane Austen starb im Alter von nur 41 Jahren an einer Nebenniereninsuffizienz.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tubby Dubonnet is a lawyer who likes fishing, beer and off-track betting. His clients include a cross-dresser referred by the very doctor he's suing for a botched skin-creolizing, and a lakefront bar owner who has held on to a nearly $1 million payoff after a shrimpboat marijuana bust. The bar owner hands over the money locked in a gym bag to Tubby, then is murdered, leaving behind a death scene portrayed with jarring comic understatement. Tubby grapples with the temptation of riches and the threats of claimants, and, as he sorts out the rogues from and among the buttoned-downs, he dispatches the villain and finds a home for the cash in a conclusion that's as cleverly convoluted and amusing as the rest of this tale, the first in a projected series.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 65, "rating_average": 4.2769, "rating_total": 278.0}

In 1986, he completed his M.A.S. with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and has served as an Adjunct professor with that university since that time.

These thriller novels are connected by a common ongoing story that parallels what we hear in the news on a daily basis. While the books are fiction, as you read these stories you can imagine terrorist events in the book could be announced on the news at any time. These are stories to stimulate your imagination, to provide fictional entertainment using multi-threaded plots. But these thrillers also warn of the overconfidence by our government that negotiation can replace the critical need for a strong military. They delve into our use of intelligence services and how we politicize the critically necessary use of terrorist interrogation. A premise of Near Side of the Precipice and Cold Honor pushes against the problem of our porous borders that are vulnerable to weapons and drug trafficking. Finally, there is a need to focus on domestic terrorism as well as terrorism directed at America from beyond our borders. We sometimes ignore the existence of state sponsored terrorism and how it affects us in our homeland, or how it already has. Both of my thrillers take you there.The fear that a hostile sovereign state will supply terrorists with nuclear or biological weapons to achieve their burning desire to strike at America is of great concern to me. Although a fictional list of countries were used to develop the plots of both books, the probability of real covert nuclear proliferation to terrorists coming from North Korea and Iran is prophetic. There are other concerns as well; the fall of the Pakistani government with nuclear weapons to the Taliban and the increasing silence about the growth of radical jihadist education amongst moderate governments in the Mideast and Asia. It's a dangerous world.I hope you find Near Side of the Precipice and Cold Honor good reads that prompt your thoughts about terrorism.Thank you for your interest.Near Side of the Precipice and Cold Honor: Two novels - one story.", "related": ["B00KBB4UMM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

People who know her consider her to possess a unique energy that draws others in. Her personality is infectious, she can make you smile just by sharing a room with you. Her heart is very giving, and it is that giving nature that drives her to create her website and share yoga with others.

Benchmarks of his uneven progress include his serial sexual abuse at the hands of the local parish priest and his falling in love with a beautiful older girl, Saidhbh. A bit improbably (he’s only 14; she’s 17), she returns his affections and in short order becomes pregnant. The two go to London, planning an abortion. But will they follow through, and what will happen to them in the city? Maher’s first novel features a wonderfully sympathetic protagonist and first-person narrator in Jim, while his family—his parents and five older sisters—are equally endearing. The voice and tone are spot on, but after a realistic treatment of the characters and a nicely realized setting, the book takes a very odd turn near the end when Jim discovers New Age thought and practices. Indeed, the ending almost seems to belong to another book but is redeemed by the boy’s rapprochement with his family. Inconsistency aside, The Fields is an often humorous, always diverting exercise that is sure to charm readers. --Michael Cart", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I realized then that something was changing in America. My first foray into political activism was doing a little volunteer work for Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. I was fortunate enough to attend his Inaugural Ball--a genuine thrill! In the years that followed I involved myself as a volunteer and contributor to many political candidates and causes. I always tried to support those who stood by our Constitution. I also volunteered in missions to help victims of Communism in Central America. In 1993 I was one of about 85,000 at an event called \"Dan's Bake Sale\"--what a blast! I used to believe that all we needed to do to save our liberty was to elect good people to office; but I have learned that that is no longer enough. We have a bigger problem that must be fixed--and, of course, we must also elect better people. My business career involved nearly forty years as a problem solver. I did consulting to many giant companies to address problems they were unable to solve themselves. I learned that in order to fix a problem you must first identify the CAUSE. Most people simply attack the symptom endlessly. That will not succeed. I applied that strategy to what I consider the largest problem we have in our government today and devised a plan to fix it. That is what my book \"Pruning the Fourth Branch\" is about.  I have posted a few photos to \"Amazon's Al Lee Page\" from various politcal campaigns or projects and a video of a speech I recorded when I was a candidate for congress. My political campaign was what initially brought the issue of reforming Administrative Law to my attention. I hope you find them interesting.

It makes a significant contribution to the important conversation about the relation of Scripture and Christian Ethics not only because these Biblical passages surely count among the most important and influential biblical passages for Christian Ethics but also because of its innovative use of the virtue tradition as the mode of exposition. Moreover, the epilogue comparing his exposition to the Confucian tradition is a brief but important contribution to comparative ethics. It's a good book, and I welcome it.(Allen Verhey, Duke Divinity School)Lucas Chan skillfully brings together biblical exegesis and ethical theory in this excellent book. He is a bridge builder across cultures, east and west, and confessional differences, Catholic and Protestant. Yet the truly masterful achievement of Chan’s work is the ability to cross over and back between biblical scholars and moral theologians to develop a biblical ethic that is insightful and wise.(Kenneth R. Himes, O.F.M., Boston College)Lúcás Chan combines responsible exegesis with sophisticated ethical theory in a way that is all too rare in studies of biblical ethics. Rooted in Catholic tradition, he draws on Calvin as well as Aquinas and even interacts with Confucianism. This is a stimulating and important contribution to the study of biblical values.(John J. Collins, Holmes Professor of Old Testament, Yale University)This book constitutes a major step forward in the blending of biblical studies and ethics. Moreover, it brings together scholarly research, wisdom, and practical insights for our daily lives. It offers treasures for any reader seeking paths for moral and spiritual growth.(Margaret A. Farley, Gilbert L. Stark Professor of Christian Ethics, Yale University Divinity School)Chan, a Jesuit from Hong Kong, seeks to bring together biblical studies and Christian ethics through the vehicle of Christian virtue ethics, and illustrates his approach with reference to theTen Commandments and the Beatitudes. After an eleven-page prologue, Chan develops his schema for bridging biblical studies and Christian ethics. Then through the lens of virtue ethics, he examines each of the Ten Commandments according to Exod 20:2-17, and each of the Beatitudes in Mt 5:3-12. For each of the Commandments and the Beatitudes, he starts with the original meaning of the text and explores its significance for contemporary Christian moral living through a hermeneutics of virtue ethics. At the end of the book he discusses the possible reception of the core Christian virtues of theTen Commandments and the Beatitudesfor Confucian society out of his conviction that interfaith or cross-cultural ethics begins with very specific texts and needs to be both text-based and interpretive. J. F. Keenan and D. J. Harrington have provided a three-page foreword.(New Testament Abstracts)This is an important contribution to Catholic and Christian ethics that works to bridge the key sources of Scripture and systematic ethical reflection. Too often scholars either explore the biblical perspectives on ethics alone or take a more philosophical approach to ethics, but not the two together. Chan, who is on the faculty of Trinity College in Dublin, focuses on two key biblical texts that have had enormous influence on Christian ethics—the Decalogue and the Beatitudes. He probes these biblical sources through the lens of \"virtue\" ethics, an approach to ethical reflection that has to come to the forefront in recent years. This approach does not focus just on identifying moral principles but also considers the issues of character formation, Christian practices, and habits of virtue. Chan wants not only to bring sound biblical exegesis to these key biblical texts but to consider their practical meaning for an ethical Christian life.(The Bible Today)InThe Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes: Biblical Studies and Ethics for Real Life, Yiu Sing Lúcás Chan, a Jesuit from Hong Kong who trained at Boston College, seeks to build bridges between the two disciplines with the help of Christian virtue ethics. The key questions of virtue ethics are, Who am I? What is my goal? and How do I achieve that goal? Done in the Christian key, we are children of God in search of eternal happiness with God through Christ. The cultivation of the appropriate virtues, attitudes and dispositions is the major task of Christian virtue ethics.(America)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In reading this dramatic and action-packed novel about piracy and children in extreme peril, it is difficult not to suspect that the author has a variety of personal and professional motives in framing the story as she does. The novel begins and ends with a slight time shift, in that two Coast Guardsmen fighting on the front lines of the drug war interact with a couple of characters of the previous period of widespread piracy at the beginning of the 19th century in the Gulf Coast, which gave us antiheroes like the Lafitte brothers and Jose Gaspar. Included among these possible lessons includes the relationship between piracy as well as the illicit trafficking of souls and drugs and the moral corruption of those who conduct and turn a blind eye to the trade.   It is also obvious from the author s blunt approach to children in peril as well as frequent lewd comments that the author s background as a survivor of child abuse appears to have been at least a contributing factor to the way that this novel is written. This is not a novel for those who are squeamish about rape and murder and the degradation that people can suffer at the hands of the wicked. Indeed, when the heroine of this novel is introduced, she is a twelve year old seeking to seduce much older men for compensation at the encouragement of her mother, who responds to a rebuke about her poor parenting with the retort: How dare you tell me how to raise my child (59). There are a lot of aspects of this novel, given my own personal background, that were unpleasant to deal with, and the author is honest and unromantic in her portrayal of the early 1800 s world of piracy.   The plot follows a variety of characters, including a British midshipmen who had been kidnapped after getting drunk in New Orleans, the aforementioned young lady who escapes being pimped out by her mother and becomes a stowaway and eventually a queer sort of pirate by pretending to be a man (albeit not very well), an African slave who seeks his freedom and a return trip home across the Atlantic, a bachelor mariner introduced as a potential customer in prostitution who shows himself to be an honorable and decent man, if unsuccessful in finding marriage, a group of pirate captains who have varying but slight to no degrees of personal honor and integrity, including one pirate (Jose Gaspar) who is still celebrated to this day by the city of Tampa as one of their civic heroes, and another couple of pirate (the Lafitte brothers) who provided valuable services to the United States during the War of 1812, but whose piratical ways eventually ended in their exile and (presumably) death.   While dealing with the grim reality of piracy, the novel also looks at how the response to piracy was hampered by a variety of factors, including the lack of political will on the part of nations to cooperate with others against the scourge of piracy or to put the resources into building ships and training crews to fight against pirates, or even the political will on the part of corrupt civic leaders to arrest pirates instead of participate in the illicit trade as partners in crime. The fact that these same elements exist where piracy is still a global problem and where the drug trade is involved gives a common tie between the early 1800 s and our own supposedly much more enlightened world. --Continued from the Reviewer: Nathan Albright, Historian with a M.A. in Military History for the Naval Historical FoundationWhile reading an adventure novel about young people in extreme peril trying to retain such virtue as they possess while being caught up against their will in the world of piracy, the reader is also led along the path of understanding the corruption that remains within businesses and governments and the process by which piracy and illicit behavior endangers legitimate activities and eventually encourages nations to devote the resources to removing safe bases of operation from those engaged in piracy and other corrupt behavior.   This is not only a novel that entertains with a dramatic and exciting plot, nor occasionally disturbs the reader with its grim realism in dealing with pirate humor that would only be found these days by a member of one of Tampa s pirate krewes during Gasparilla festivals, but also instructs the reader on contemporary reality that mirrors the uncertain days of the early 1800 s when the rule of law slowly cut off the freedom of the seas that allowed piracy to prosper. An afterword provides a brief historical commentary on the real and imagined characters within the novel as well as their world. For those who like their language salty, their novels full of real historical characters, their plots full of action like raiding ships and fortresses and dealing with corrupt political leaders, as well as a little bit of time slip to add some contemporary relevance, this novel will have much to offer, as long as the reader is not squeamish about its language or its contents. --Naval Historical Foundation, Washington DC", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It’s no wonder: Da disdains everything and everyone, thrashing around in a bleak, bitter depression ever since his wife died, and making Stanley’s life unbearable. In Angus’ vividly written first novel, based on the British Army’s Messenger Dog Service, Stanley fibs about his age, enlists, learns of the messenger dog service, and becomes a trainer. The dogs work heroically as runners across the battlefields of France, carrying communiqués about enemy whereabouts. The action is highly dramatic, and readers will feel catapulted into the trenches, surrounded on all sides, at a time when an Allied victory was by no means assured. Stanley’s two charges, first Bones and then Pistol, will thrill readers with their canine derring-do. True, the miraculous coincidences pile up a bit awkwardly in this affecting heart-warmer, but you probably won’t find a more exciting dog story out there.

When auxiliary Bishop Ramon Diego is bludgeoned to death, his aide, Father Don Carleson, formerly a missionary in Central America, is arrested quickly. Even though the ruthlessly ambitious Diego had used his amiable adjunct as a mere gofer, Carleson doesn't seem the murdering type to Koesler or the rest of the city's clergy. But an ambitious prosecuting attorney and the investigating police lieutenant are pleased with the quick arrest and eager for a high-profile conviction. While interviewing Koesler, the prosecuting attorney reveals a personal interest in the suspect and determines his course of attack in the case, a line which Koesler, to his horror, has inadvertently supported. Although the official investigation is closed with the arrest, Koesler's police friend Lt. Tully keeps his detectives searching for clues. Another death finally leads Kienzle's intrepid clergyman through an intricate course in canon law to a mundane solution.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0088OVJTQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You can explore this world of cheeses at home by making them yourself. InSimply Soft Cheese,\nwe'll have a little fun with a not-so-serious history of cheese, cover the\nessential supplies and equipment you'll need, go over the basic techniques\nyou'll use throughout the book and then delve into a dozen cheeses. Some cheeses in this book may be unfamiliar to you, so along\nwith each cheese I'll provide a recipe to show you how to use your batch of\nhomemade goodness. Although all the cheeses inSimply Soft Cheeseare easy to make, I've listed them in order of\ndifficulty and recommend you try them in the order they are presented. Don't\nlet that scare you. Almost every soft cheese uses the same basic techniques. As\nyou proceed through the recipes, you'll simply be trying new ingredients and a\nfew other cheese making skills that I'll guide you through step-by-step.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sid graduated from Dixie College and worked in steel fabrication for over two decades. He was an excellent orator, loved reading, and was a life-long learner. During the last year of his life, he created thirty- three original steel art pieces. He was a remarkable teacher and story teller. As the primary author, Sid combined his love for science, history, space exploration, and science fiction. He used his experiences from Special Forces in the Army National Guard to influence the story's war themes and subject content. His knowledge of steel fabrication design and art work helped him to conceptualize structural aspects of the moon station featured in this book. Beth graduated from Southern Utah State College experiencing thirty-four years in social work, gerontology, and community planning. However, her favorite roles have been wife and mother. She enjoys creating stories, object lessons, and poems for training activities. Sid began the collaboration of this work with his wife, one year before his sudden death. Together they shared hundreds of hours, enjoying creative thinking and brainstorming. Many years later, after her retirement, Beth was able to fulfill the commitment she made to develop and complete, The Salt of Tranquility\" Beth drew upon aspects of the couple's close relationship with family and with the Lord, establishing those associations as underlying values in the story. Readers may gain an appreciation for special bonds that exist, connecting life in this world to those in a parallel universe. It is Beth's desire for this book to showcase Sid's amazing intellect and his creative imagination. It is also written as a legacy for Sid's children, grand children, family and friends to remember him\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is a holder of two patents for the ISE Stock Exchange, launched in 2006, and is the founder of the Arizona Stock Exchange, launched in 1992, both regulated markets that provided an inside look at how the SEC operates. Wunsch saw up close how today’s market structure problems, such as high-frequency trading and the collapse of IPOs, had their roots in SEC regulation, as he predicted in testimony, comment letters, articles and speeches going back to the 1990s and 1980s, which are collected in his earlier Kindle books. His new work, Nature’s God, dives deep into the regulatory fallacy causing the disintegration of the stock market, and finds a reflection of the inequality debate tearing America apart today. This discovery thoroughly upends traditional market structure theory. But far more important, it provides the key to settling the increasingly uncivil class wars dividing America and the world.", "related": [], "rank": 2626738, "title": "Nature's God eBook", "author": "Steve Wunsch", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of my books are written with that goal in mind. I've been fortunate to have traveled to many countries around the world and interacted with people from the president of the country to the family living in a shack with a dirt floor. Being among people of many cultures, religions and social standings, watching them in their daily lives, seeing their hopes and aspirations for their children and the joys they have with their families and friends, has continually struck me with a deep feeling of oneness. I've been with elderly people as they breathed their last breath and at the birth of babies when they take their first. It's all very humbling. This amazing world we live in and the wonderful people that fill it have given me so much. My books are my way to give back as much as I can to as many people as I can. You can contact me through the Contact Us form on www.celestinelight.org. If you have enjoyed any of my books, I would be honored if you would take a few moments to visit the book page on Amazon and leave a review for the book.

He is married and the proud father of two children.By many world criteria, Serge had a very successful life. He had received a privileged education, worked for some of the world's most admired companies, and before the age of 37 had realized a life-long ambition: to become CEO of a publicly-quoted company. In this capacity, he had the opportunity to join the world elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2001. He was married to the woman of his dreams, and had two beautiful children. He had \"everything\" to be happy, right? However, this was not the case. In his heart, he didn't have peace since he always felt pressured to perform and to prove himself to the world; he was restless, unhappy and found no meaning in life.Until one day, and through one of life's surprises, Serge got to know the living God! Not the god he had heard from as a child: a god who wants people to be poor and suffering; a god who is defined by a bunch of rules, a list of dont'ts , a straight jacket for life. No. He got to know a God of love and a God of life; a God who wants us to live in complete freedom, to be full of expectancy, to pursue amazing dreams, and to enjoy so much abundance that it overflows!Following his encounter with Jesus, Serge spent seven years he what he calls \"God's detoxification clinic\" before starting with his family SRL Ministries (www.SRLministries.org), which aims to help both unbelievers and Christians open new taps of abundance in their lives in such key areas such as health, marriage, parenthood, financial matters, etc.", "related": [], "rank": 3423449, "title": "A NEW BEGINNING: 4 WEEKS TO A GREAT MARRIAGE", "author": "Serge Roux-Levrat", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is utterly harrowing, completely plausible, constantly nerve-shredding ... It plays on the deepest, darkest fears of all parents about their children, and embeds that everyday terror in a plot so up-to-the-minute that you'll swear it's been lifted from the pages of a newspaper ... The Cry is a remarkable novel - its devastating power all the stronger for its realistic rendering. Brilliant stuff.' Doug Johnstone, Independent on Sunday Exceptional ... this powerful noir tale is by turns devastating and uplifting. Chris Ewan, author of Safe House A book you find yourself greedily gulping down. Herald The harrowing plot keeps you gripped until the final, devastating revelation. Sunday Mirror In this very modern novel, which arrives at a startling conclusion, Fitzgerald manipulates our knowledge of earlier cases in which women have been wrongly accused. -- Joan Smith Sunday Times The Cry really is extraordinary. In a just universe, it will be [Helen FitzGerald's] Gone Girl moment. Read it at once. Steve Mosby 'Fitzgerald's punchy thriller fleshes out new circles of parental hell -- Emma Hagestadt Independent Brilliant ... 300 pages of taut, sharp, chilling and often laugh out loud funny genius. Lisa Jewell It is not until the final pages and after twist upon twist that we are finally given a punch in the stomach, an ending that still leaves a question. Did she or didn't she? Is she mad or not? You've got to read this inventive domestic drama to find out. Highly recommended, read it and then all her others, particularly The Donor. She is very special. lovereading.co.uk An incredible read. I couldn't put it down. A beautifully crafted, heartbreaking story. Lisa O'Donnell 'THE CRY is excellent; unsettling and filled with moral ambiguity. Go read her. Now.' Russel D McLean This book takes a nightmare scenario and wrings every last drop of suspense out of it. It's gut wrenching in places, heart breaking in others, a purely visceral experience like very few other crime novels I can think of ... The Cry has been packaged to appeal to fans of Sophie Hannah and Julia Crouch - those doyennes of domestic noir - and while FitzGerald's style is more streamlined, darker and earthier, I think those fans will do well to add her to their must-read lists. 2013 has already proved to be a strong year for psychological fiction but The Cry is without question the best yet. -- Eva Dolan Crime Fiction Lover 'Her finest book to date ... thriller writing of the very highest order. Big Issue Scotland 'Stunningly good.' Mark Edwards My favourite read of 2013 (so far - but I can't see it being beat). Luca Veste I loved it. It's beautifully written and absolutely heartrending.

The civilizations of its Interior are piled on the ruins of a terrifyingly ancient history. A legacy of brutal warfare and struggles for primacy between the monstrous kith of legend predates the emergence of the Amaan, humans. Haunted by the attrocities of the Cannibal Wars that tore their own nascent empire apart, the Amaan have eschewed the growth of nations, instead raising independent city-states as population centers. Wielding broken virtues and unlikely sorceries, venturers are the drifters and exiles of the Vast Land, expendable strangers to be flung against unthinkable perils. Any who set off toward the flat horizons are given up as lost by the civilized kith of the Interior. Otherworldly wights roam the fringes, full of boundless malice and strange appetites. To walk in their steps, buffeted by the raw forces of creation pouring forth from the shiftlands, is to be transformed beyond the knowledge of all-kith.", "related": ["B00FEQPXOI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From a very young age, Kathy showed an aptitude for telling stories. Of course, her mother called her a pathological liar, but Kathy prefers to think back on those days as an apprenticeship for her future craft. Kathy learned how to write from the best—the authors who penned the books she spent countless hours reading.

Among the techniques they identify and describe are \"imaging,\" \"abstracting,\" \"body thinking\" and \"empathizing.\" Although there is considerable overlap between categories (for example, in the sections on \"analogizing\" and on \"recognizing patterns\"), the Root-Bernsteins succeed in defining each category's uniqueness. Freely acknowledging that they are not asserting anything startlingly novel, the authors present an impressive number of firsthand accounts of the creative process, from Albert Einstein and Merce Cunningham to Oliver Sacks and Charles Ives. Some may have trouble accepting the premise that all creative thinking--whether for poetic composition or scientific experiment, and regardless of the thinker's native culture or language--is \"universally\" categorizable, but the authors make a strong case for a view that is becoming increasingly popular. They conclude with a list of suggestions for how to transform education from the elementary level up so that it is better suited to our demanding, multidimensional culture.

Started in 1925, the publication has yet to disappoint readers with substandard short stories or essay content. Despite having a heavy focus on the New York life scene, there is so much included on general arts and life that readers from all over the world continue to enjoy the magazine.The New Yorker magazine is famous for its covers, normally created by a popular political cartoonist. These covers have made waves in the publishing world, as well as had a tremendous influence on art. None can say this as much as the Saul Steinberg illustration for the March 29, 1976, edition. Called View of the World from 9th Avenue, the drawing focuses strictly on a few blocks in Manhattan, with the rest of the world an afterthought.A familiar illustration has often graced the cover throughout the past eighty-seven years. His name is Eustace Tilley, but he is no one of factual importance. The character was created specifically for the first cover and evolved into a mascot for the magazine. Eustace was based on the cartoonish image of Count d'Orsay found in the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica's 11th edition.The New Yorker magazine has had a hand in bringing many popular movies to the big screen. Based on short stories, essays, and articles that have run throughout the pages, dozens of blockbuster and award-winning films have garnered attention by being featured in the magazine. These include The Hours, Adaptation, Angela's Ashes, Boys Don't Cry, In Cold Blood, and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.A subscription to The New Yorker magazine keeps you up to date on what's happening not only in the Big Apple, but also in art, literature, and politics in general. It lets you stay enriched wherever you are currently living with thoughtful essays, fiction stories, and articles that delve into every area of American culture.", "related": ["B001AHPAX4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

New Mexico Magazine said of the book, \"The story moves along like detective fiction . . . .\" Since the publication of that book, Recko has written articles on a variety of historical topics for magazines and historical journals and has become a sought after speaker. While working on Murder on the White Sands he began to research Pinkerton's National Detective Agency. The result was the discovery of new information that Recko included in his book and in subsequent biographic articles that he wrote about Pinkerton operative John C. Fraser for the WWHA Journal and Wild West magazine. His research into Pinkerton's agency also led to his discovery of largely forgotten agent Timothy Webster, the subject of his new book,  A Spy for the Union: The Life and Execution of Timothy Webster (McFarland & Co., 2013).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His remarkable passion for adventure and their incomparable bond as father and daughter inspired her to create this book and hopefully many more to come.

We focus on two specific stocks each\nmorning.  These two stocks are picked among thousands of possible stocks\n because they have a high probability of earning a nice return in a\nshort amount of time.  Members in this chat room are told the stocks\npicks before the market opens each day, so they are ready for action.\nThen, I give a sound in the chat room to signify my entry on the trade.\n I provide a target exit price.  And then I issue another sound when I\nam exiting the trade.  Members simply copy my actions.  Given this\nopportunity, members can often make enough money in the first few\nminutes of the trading day to take the rest of the day off.  You don't\nhave to sit at the computer all day, grinding out trade after trade.\nJust take and copy my high probability system and entries, and you walk\naway with the profit.  It doesn't get much easier than this.Morning Hours Trading(morninghourstrading.com) is a chat room\nthat focuses on the morning gaps each day.  This room is led by my good\nfriend Bob Joiner.  For three hours each morning, Bob focuses on 3 to 5\nstocks and gives his entries, targets, and stops for those trades.\nAfter getting into the trade, he gives ongoing analysis of each trade so\n that members can make their own decisions about the exact exit for the\ntrades.", "related": ["B007XGVPBM"], "rank": 77857, "title": "High Probability Day Trading Strategies and Systems eBook", "author": "Manny Backus", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being a morning person allows her to get all her writing and other work done which leaves her time in the evenings for her favorite shows. Any given evening you can find her watching shows like NCIS, NCIS Los Angeles, Criminal Minds, Burn Notice, CSI, Elementary, Person of Interest and numerous others. Her interests don’t stop at regular suspense but extend to the great beyond. One of her favorite series was Stargate SG-1. She’s still waiting for a trip through the shimmering worm-hole ring. Warehouse 13 has also caught her interest and has sparked ideas for several stories. With all of these shows filled with quite a bit of violence you may wonder at her calling herself a romance writer. Never fear, while she enjoys the intricacies of figuring out the how, who, and why of crimes her real love is for the relationships that bind the players together. She is always trying to figure out the bonds between partners on and off the force, the dance between people at work, at play, and in their everyday settings.

There is no dialogue between characters. It is not the traditional format for a science fiction novel, but it does add a unique dimension to the story, bringing the reader closer to the main character as the actions and events unfold. The AMP series is also first person, but it follows the popular format with character dialogue. Aside from eBooks the writings are also available in print from the author's web site http://www.arsenex.com. Stephen enjoys reader feedback.

Hall-- Palmer Theological Seminary\"Interpreting the Bible well is a daunting and difficult task, one that requires wise mentors in the faith from both the past and the present. Michael Graves is a wise, learned, perceptive guide who knows the church fathers well; this wonderful book will help modern readers understand the rhyme and reason of ancient Christian perspectives on inspiration and interpretation. Highly recommended.\"Mark W. Elliott-- University of St. Andrews\"Michael Graves's research is painstaking -- his endnotes here show a depth of endeavor and learning -- yet he has a sharp, even provocative thesis: the church fathers saw scriptural inspiration to be about God speaking through the Bible to each reader 'at sundry times and in divers manners.'. . . A gripping scholarly work that combines learning with praxis, historical theology with self-reflection.\"Markus Bockmuehl-- University of Oxford\"Drawing on the resources of the early church, Michael Graves takes an interestingly textured approach to the abiding questions surrounding a theology of scripture. . . . Anyone who cares about the subject matter will welcome this book’s fresh and engaging attention to the early church’s hermeneutical diversity.\"Peter Enns-- Eastern University\"In this concise and readable volume, Michael Graves navigates the diverse and complex landscape of the nature and use of Scripture among the church’s earliest theologians. His engaging account invites readers of Scripture today neither to pillage the ancients for our own agenda, nor to ignore them to our poverty, but to converse with them along our own contemporary hermeneutical journey. A much-needed entry point to the sometimes bewildering world of ancient Christian interpreters, this book will prove to be of great value for addressing any number of interpretive issues that beset the church today.\"D. H. Williams-- Baylor University\"A most learned and realistic assessment of scriptural authority and use in the patristic era. Steeped in primary sources, Graves invites us to enter the interpretive world of the ancients instead of making them suit our expectations.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She grew up in Australia, in sunny Queensland on a canal side property with her family. She also lived walking distance from Surfers Paradise, and the nearby beautiful beaches of the Gold Coast. Although Alicia is most probably and most certainly biased, she makes no secret in her belief that the Gold Coast is one the most breathtaking places in the world (where the beaches have real waves). However, by no means is Alicia a real surfer, although learning how to surf is definitely on her bucket list.  When she was twenty-four, Alicia realised she was curious about the world and she jumped on a plane and relocated to London. The move was only supposed to be for two years, but seven and a half years later, she was still living there with her husband. Together they explored England, Europe and the world as much as possible.  Although writing has always been a passion for Alicia it was in London where she began to write furiously. Writing is indeed a lonely occupation but luckily Alicia is not just a writer, she’s also an animal lover. She desperately would love a pet but her nomad life will not permit one. So, Alicia wrote this book with the company of a fostered cat (from the RSPCA) named Buttons (who is now called Clarence by his new adopted owners). When Buttons found his new parents she tried to encourage and attempt the stray cats of Highbury and Islington to take his place – to no avail. They would not join the party. Over the last two years Alicia and her husband started on their journey back home to Australia. There’s been a little bit of side-tracking, with both the beach and the snow beckoned from different parts of the world. Together they've explored and lived in amazing countries including Thailand, Mexico, Austria and Malta.

Dr. Dial has always been fascinated with human behavior and relationships, and the connection between one’s past and present. This passion led her to the psychology profession and continues to guide her practice. Years of experience, education and training have made her a well-rounded psychologist, but her intuition and keen powers of observation are what allow her to help clients “in the moment.”  She believes that when we can truly be present, reality becomes more alive and dynamic. Possibilities open up and the big picture can come together more easily.

Passionately written, acutely aware of the historical context,The Zhivago Affairalmost makes one nostalgic for a time when novels were so important that even the CIA cared about them.”—Ken Kalfus, author ofA Disorder Peculiar to the Country, finalist for the 2006 National Book Award“A thrilling literary espionage yarn, but much more than that. Drawing on secret records from the Kremlin, the CIA, and a visionary Italian publisher, Finn and Couvée piece together the story behind the publication of one of the great novels of the 20th century. In the process, they shed new light on the Cold War struggle for the hearts and minds of millions of people, introducing a cast of characters—poets and spies, idealists and cynics, politicians and dissidents—who could have stepped out of the pages ofDoctor Zhivagoitself.”—Michael Dobbs, author ofSix Months in 1945: From World War to Cold War “The Zhivago Affairis a sparkling and fascinating account of how one of the most important novels of the 20th century found its way back to Russia, a juggernaut of truth thrust into the Soviet darkness. Peter Finn and Petra Couvée elegantly and authoritatively capture Pasternak’s brilliance, the courage of his friends, and the CIA’s hidden role in bringing the forbidden book to Russian readers.”—David E. Hoffman, author ofThe Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and its Dangerous Legacy, winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize“This is the most detailed account to date of the events that suddenly placed one of Russia's greatest poets in the center of the struggle between Soviet and Western propaganda machines at the height of the Cold War. Pasternak's personal courage in the face of this totally incongruous conflict is the quality that emerges most clearly from this well-paced narrative, which is especially commendable for its avoidance of all romantic exaggeration—a quality Pasternak himself strove for inDoctor Zhivago. The book is of great relevance today, when such conflicts seem (but only seem) to have disappeared.”—Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, translators ofDoctor Zhivago(2010)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My enthusiasm\nhad outrun both my research and my skills as a novelist. Influenced by advice\non \"what would sell,\" I warped the story and lost the thread. The product was\nhalf-baked ― and it rightfully\ndid not sell very well. This past year, while looking for\na new project after finishing my Leonidas trilogy, I looked again at this, the\nfirst novel I ever published. Even as I cringed at the product as it stood, I\nrecognized that it had great potential. I decided it deserved a second chance. The new novel incorporates some\nscenes from the old, but it is essentially a new work, hence the new title. It\nhas greatly benefited from much more research on the Albigensian Crusade, the Seventh\nCrusade, and the crusader kingdoms generally. I hope it has also benefited from\ngreater skill on my part as a novelist. It has certainly benefited from the\nskilled editing of Christina Dickson and the cover art by Charles Whall.", "related": ["B00FIP2GTA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kay Marie adores romance preferably the raw, sexy and emotional romance with flawed characters who tug at your heartstrings. Her affinity for words was ignited in childhood. Nevertheless, she didn't view writing as a career, more of something she did for the pure love of it secretly. Throughout the years, she has held numerous jobs that she felt never really fulfilled her in the way that writing did. So in 2013, she decided to throw caution to the wind, take a leap of faith and publish a book-- that she wrote and released in just one week. The nonfiction book written under her real name, did something unexpected which lead her to the contemporary and erotic romance section of books on Amazon. She felt like it was fate that sparked her to do one of the things she loves most, penning fictional steamy romance stories. Utilizing her keen business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit, she decided that she would go all in with writing through self-publishing. When she is not writing tantalizing tales, she enjoys reading, singing, movies, listening to music and spending time with family and loved ones. \"I am just a big girl with big dreams who believes that the impossible can happen each and every day.\"-Kay Marie", "related": ["B00L6G4Q0M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
